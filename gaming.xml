		<p>If you’re not up to speed on Hollow Knight: Silksong, here’s the short version. It was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-silksong-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch/">announced in February 2019</a>, but then updates were few and far between until a new trailer was revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase in June 2022. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed/">officially delayed in May 2023</a>, and then in April 2025 it appeared in a sizzle reel for Nintendo with a 2025 release date.</p>
<p>However, the lack of communication and six-year (and counting) development time has led fans to joke that the game will never come out.&nbsp; A playable demo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-at-the-xbox-gamescom-booth-this-year/">should be on the floor</a> at Gamescom 2025 starting tomorrow, but as there was a playable demo in 2019 that doesn’t mean much to the fans.</p>


<p>In a massive tease, Team Cherry have now posted a video that will launch a “Special Announcement” for the game at 3.30pm on 21st August.&nbsp; The internet has responded in the only way possible by suggesting that the big announcement is that the game is cancelled.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was scheduled to come to PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, and Xbox, and was also meant to be a Day One launch on Game Pass. However, some of those details are now years old so things may have changed since then.</p>

<p>Here’s a little more about the game, but again, this is from previous announcements so may not be accurate.</p>
<p><em>Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast, unfamiliar world. She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.</em></p>
<p><em>Hornet must master a whole new suite of powerful moves to survive. She’ll unleash devastating attacks, learn incredible silken abilities, and craft deadly tools in order to overcome the kingdom’s challenges. Over 150 all-new foes stand between Hornet and the shining citadel crowning the kingdom. Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights – Hornet must face them all with bravery and skill!</em></p>
<p><em>The vast inter-connected world of Hollow Knight: Silksong is brought vividly to life in a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D style. Gilded cities, Lakes of fire, and misted moors are illustrated in exquisite detail and accompanied by a vibrant orchestral score. In her search for the truth behind her capture, Hornet will befriend surprising strangers, discover shocking secrets and solve ancient mysteries in a kingdom full of wonders.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Team Cherry has announced that it will host a "<em>Special Announcement</em>" for Hollow Knight Silksong this coming Thursday, August 21, 2025, at 7:30am PT / 10:30am ET / 3:30pm BST. It's the first official word from Team Cherry on its highly anticipated title in what feels like forever, and it is likely when we'll learn about the game's release date, if we don't hear about it today during Gamescom ONL 2025, that is.</p>



<p>"<em>The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!," </em>the description of the video, which is set to premiere on YouTube, reads. The studio shared the same message on <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, so for now it seems like that's all we'll get from them until Thursday.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We've known that Silksong would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">playable at Gamescom 2025</a> for a while now, and with its marketing ties to Xbox and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there's been a lot of speculation that when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">officially learn the release date</a> for the new Xbox handheld, we'll also learn the release date for Silksong.</p>



<p>That could still be true, and with the ROG Xbox Ally release date likely going live during Gamescom ONL 2025, Silksong's release date could be part of the ONL news cycle, with this presentation later in the week being a deep-dive into gameplay. At least, that would be the case, if not for Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claiming that the release date is being saved for the Thursday presentation.</p>







<p>We'll see how it all shakes out by the end of today, and if Silksong makes an appearance during the ONL presentation. What's certain, is that we are in the final stretch for Silksong. The wait is almost over, and we'll soon have a lot more official news on the title than we've had in the years since it was first announced. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remastered-confirmed-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-xillia-remastered-officially-confirmed-for-october.1273884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game to be getting the remaster treatment is none other than&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, and the remaster is due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Last week, the studio accidentally confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor" rel="nofollow">via an unfortunate YouTube thumbnail</a>, but earlier today, the remaster was officially revealed. It's landing on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch (but not Switch 2, strangely) on October 31st.</p>

<p>The project is part of Bandai Namco's promise to release remastered versions of games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">"fairly consistently"</a>, with the first entry in the so-called Remaster Project, namely&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow">launching earlier this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remastered-october-cast.jpg?itok=mIx5svaa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remastered-october-cast.jpg?itok=qyikAuRN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>is the next game to get Bandai Namco's remaster treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed on the game's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/news/whats-new-tales-of-xillia-remastered" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, there are plenty of changes and quality-of-life improvements coming to&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, so even if you think you know the original inside out, this one's probably worth picking up.</p>

<p>Big changes include new "vivid and beautiful graphics", as well as the inclusion of over 40 DLC packs released for the original game, although certain licensed content (probably referring to the outfits themed around Japanese anime&nbsp;<em>Star Driver</em>) aren't included.</p>

<p>You'll also find a new autosave function that will save your game after events or "moving around the map", as well as the chance to toggle random enemy encounters, a new Retry feature if you die in battle, and much more.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which shows the work the team has done in order to update the original for modern systems, right here.</p>




<p>When the first <i>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</i>leak happened, some suggested that the direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>may also be included as part of a package, but that's not the case. I'd imagine, though, that&nbsp;<em>Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>is on the cards if this remaster does well.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on October 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gears-of-war-reloaded-game-pass-2000618432</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-coming-to-game-pass-alongside-gears-of-war-reloaded.1273881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Xbox has just announced the new games arriving on Game Pass in the second half of August, and it contains a couple of enormous names. We already knew that&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was going to be a day-one release on Microsoft’s subscription service, but we’ve now learned that <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be joining it two days later. Along with a bunch of others.</p> <p>Added today for PC is <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack’s <em>Void/Breaker</em>, developed by Stubby Games. Another game launching directly onto Game Pass, this is from the same team that created 2022’s extremely good FPS puzzler <em>The Entropy Center</em>.&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em> is a roguelite FPS in which you’re trapped in endless loops by an evil AI, and is all about lightning-fast action.</p> <p>Also arriving on PC is an early access build of <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, a game that’s proven to be well-liked on Steam in which you…well, you already guessed from the title. It’s a blacksmith management sim.</p>

 <p>Arriving tomorrow, August 20, on consoles and PC is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, the recent remake of the original&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-like spoof, and <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, the 2012 update to one of the most beloved entries in the murderous coming-of-age series. Then on August 21 there’s <em>Herdling</em>, the big-beast herding adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031/36#content">first announced at Gamescom last year</a>.</p> <p>Come August 26, the big hitter arrives. Stretch your crouching muscles because it’s <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, the anticipated remastering of the original <em>Gears of War</em> from 2006. Being published by Xbox Games Studios, it’s coming straight to Game Pass Ultimate, but in our new, strange future, it’s also being released for sale on PlayStation as well.</p>

 <p>Then there’s the big surprise for this month, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. While the game has developed some manner of infamy for allegedly being poorly treated by both <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">BioWare</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169">EA</a>, and was then caught in the tiresome culture wars, it remains a solid RPG and a great piece of storytelling in a well-loved universe. It already faced the ignominy of being <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-playstation-plus-march-sonic-tmnt-1851766608">free on PS Plus just a month after it was released</a>, but perhaps makes more sense to arrive on Game Pass now that it’s six months old.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of releases for August, and the various tiers of Game Pass on which they appear:</p>

 <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Blacksmith Master </strong></em>– PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Void/Breaker</strong></em><em> –&nbsp;</em>PC&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<em><strong>Goat Simulator Remastered</strong>&nbsp;</em>– Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Standard)</p> <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<strong><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></strong> – Cloud, Console, PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</p> <p>Aug 21:&nbsp;<strong><em>Herdling</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 26:&nbsp;<strong><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p>

 <p>Aug 28:&nbsp;<strong><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Then, because the universe must be balanced, a bunch of games are leaving. On August 31 you’ll no longer have:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ben 10 Power Trip&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 3&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>This War of Mine: Final Cut&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> </ul> <p>Presumably&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> is being removed to entice you to pay for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> when it comes out in September.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced.1273875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time in six years, the Be A Pro mode in the EA Sports NHL series is getting a facelift with NHL 26. On Tuesday morning, EA Sports held a deep dive giving a look at all of the new features coming to the popular single player mode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 26 – Be A Pro Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YXarJ9r31Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-no-more-pond-hockey">No More Pond Hockey</h2>



<p>For years, EA Sports NHL’s Be A Pro started out with an interview about your player playing pond hockey ahead of the NHL draft. Well, you can say goodbye to that repetitive cutscene. Now, you’re players will start out in the World Juniors where not only are you trying to win gold for your country, but you’re also trying to improve your draft stock.</p>



<p>Aside from the starting point, Be A Pro in NHL 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-26/news/nhl-26-be-a-pro-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been completely rebuilt</a>, delivering a new immersive and dynamic version of the mode. At its core, NHL 26 introduces a chapter-based career structure that mirrors the real ups and downs of professional hockey. </p>



<p>After the aforementioned play in the World Juniors, every stage of your career unfolds in its own chapter with tailored challenges and branching outcomes. Unlike past years, your path to stardom is no longer guaranteed. Poor performance can see you demoted to the AHL, while standout play can have you playing top-line minutes.</p>



<p>Presentation has also received a complete overhaul, making career milestones feel more like true events. New cutscenes and cinematic sequences highlight key moments such as walking into your first NHL locker room, tunnel walkouts before big games, World Juniors and AHL trophy celebrations, hoisting the Stanley Cup, and even a retirement ceremony that gives your final game proper weight. A new media scrum system brings added authenticity, putting you in front of reporters where your answers impact reputation, relationships, and career trajectory. These moments help ground the grind of the season with emotional payoffs that feel earned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Off the ice, NHL 26 introduces a redesigned hub that keeps your career connected to the bigger picture. The hub tracks your active challenges, surfaces league headlines, and displays a new “form score” that reflects recent performance. This score directly affects ice time, trust from coaches, and your opportunities within the organization, creating constant accountability for how you play.</p>



<p>A major addition this year is the energy and development system, which ties performance, training, recovery, and playing style to long-term growth. Managing your energy is key to unlocking and upgrading X-Factors, rewarding players who balance intensity on the ice with smart choices off it. Your personality also develops along one of two paths, confident or influential, and are based on how you interact with teammates, media, and coaches. Salary perks, endorsements, and lifestyle upgrades further expand the role-playing aspect, giving you more control over your legacy and how you are remembered when your career comes to a close.</p>



<p>Put together, these changes look to make Be A Pro in NHL 26 the deepest and most dynamic version of the mode to date. That said, players will have to wait to see how it all comes together when the game releases for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>NHL 26 releases on September 5 for those who purchase the Deluxe Edition of the game. Those who buy the Standard Edition will get the game on September 12.</p>

When we wrote that story up yesterday, it seemed likely we were finally getting a Silksong release date at ONL. The signs are all there. It's been confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong is coming out in 2025</a>, and it's even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">playable on the show floor</a> of Gamescom this week. It's also been leaked that the ROG Xbox Ally is launching October 16, and confirmed that Silksong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retail-leak-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date">would be on the system whenever it does launch</a>. All that put together makes it pretty likely that <em>one</em> of these presentations is going to have an actual release date in it somewhere, and that release date is likely very, very soon.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957813072514408802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, my Geo is bet on a teaser of Silksong at Opening Night Live, followed by a full and more lengthy reveal on the 21st, with a release date (or even, dare I hope, a shadow drop?) at one of the two presentations. Whatever the case, it seems clear that there's no clown makeup to be had this time around: Silksong is really about to emerge from its cocoon after all these long years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">first revealed six years ago,</a> in 2019, after previously being teased as just a DLC for Hollow Knight. Since then, it's emerged and vanished multiple times,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme"> prompting a long saga of fan hope and disappointment</a> that now stands to finally come to a happy conclusion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">He doesn't seem too bothered.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Masahiro Sakurai hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45-minute Nintendo Direct</a> solely dedicated to his latest project, Kirby Air Riders. And it was a somewhat unusual Direct! Delivered in Sakurai's iconic style that he's developed from giving Super Smash Bros. presentations over the years, the whole thing felt very Smash Bros. in general. But Sakurai also opened the presentation by invoking another game, admitting that Kirby Air Riders is "basically Mario Kart".</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He said this to get ahead of criticisms or comments from the audience that it is, admittedly, a bit odd for Nintendo to have asked him to make a new Kirby Air Ride game coming out right on the heels of Mario Kart World. Both are racing games that feature a diverse roster of racers with different abilities, unique karts and courses, and similar functions such as boosting, drifting, and drafting. Sakurai says he was asked by Shinya Takahashi and Satoshi Mitsuhara to make Kirby Air Riders while he was working on DLC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might be asking yourself if it's basically Mario Kart," Sakurai said. "You race and battle with familiar characters around courses with different features, or so they say. Ok, so it basically is like Mario Kart. I even mentioned this when I received the request ot make the game. I asked them if they still wanted to do it. But as fans of the original know...The appeal of the game is not actually the races!"</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-direct-8-19-2025-29-49-screenshot-1755612633905.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-direct-8-19-2025-29-59-screenshot-1755612630057.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, as the presentation went on, it became clear that Kirby Air Riders is filling a very different niche to Mario Kart. For one, Mario Kart World made a big show of expanding its races to 24 racers at a time. But Sakurai pointedly limited Kirby Air Riders races to six, saying that "too many participants in this game can make it messy" in a seemingly lighthearted jab at Kart. In another major difference, while Kirby does have its City Trial mode as a more open zone free-for-all, its primary races are lap races, while Mario Kart World emphasizes driving from track to track across an open world. This is something that Kart fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">actually criticized since the game came out</a>, as Nintendo made efforts to push the long-distance races over circling a track three times (and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-u-turns-on-mario-kart-world-change-that-forced-more-open-world-driving-as-it-increases-chance-of-lap-type-races">U-turned on this choice later</a>).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-direct-8-19-2025-28-7-screenshot-1755612570092.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the Mario Kart comparisons though, the whole Direct just felt like a Smash Bros. presentation. Much of that is likely chalked up to it just being Sakurai's presentation style, which we've mostly seen for Smash Bros. in the past. But the dramatic way in which he revealed new characters on the roster, the visual style of the title cards and interstitials, the music and sound, and a lot of other elements lent a very Smashy feel to the whole thing. The original Kirby Air Ride took a lot of UI, sound, and style elements from Super Smash Bros. Melee, so it only makes sense to see that happen here too. It's like Mario Kart meets Super Smash Bros, almost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-kirby-air-riders-release-date">out on November 20, 2025</a>, for the Nintendo Switch 2 and will feature a wide roster of Kirby characters including Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Gooey, Chef Kawasaki, Metaknight, and more.

                <p>This year, games that were previously Xbox-exclusive properties have been migrating to PS5, including the upcoming Gears of War remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War Reloaded</a>. Just under two decades ago, the original Gears of War was one of Xbox's signature titles. Now, the co-creator of the franchise, Cliff Bleszinski, has shared his thoughts about seeing Gears of War appear on a PlayStation console.</p><p>"It doesn't feel strange," said Bleszinski during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-grand-direct-unveiling-was-classic-sakurai-as-he-jokes-its-not-another-mario-kart-clone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>Bleszinski also noted that he's interested in returning to the series as a consultant, but "crickets" has been the response from the devs. Although Bleszinski left the Gears franchise years ago, he has shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-needs-a-god-of-war-like-reboot-creator-says/1100-6518779/" data-ref-id="1100-6518779">his belief that the franchise should be rebooted</a>. Bleszinski has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-creator-discusses-his-alien-game-pitch-and-what-went-wrong/1100-6518780/" data-ref-id="1100-6518780">he pitched an Alien game</a> prior to Disney's purchase of Fox.</p><p>Gears of War Reloaded is the second remaster of the original game from 2006. All of the post-launch content from the game's first remaster, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, will be included. Microsoft has sent free upgrades for Reloaded to anyone who already has Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.</p><p>Microsoft will drop Gears of War Reloaded on August 28 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Cross-platform play and cross-progression will be supported.

                <p>DC games haven't had the best of times in recent years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">marked by a string of missteps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">canceled projects</a>. While titles like the Batman: Arkham series found success, much of the broader DC gaming output has lacked consistency. This is something James Gunn wants to remedy as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/" data-ref-id="1100-6511036">10-year plan as co-head of DC Studios</a>.</p><p>When the rebooted DCU launched in 2023, Gunn emphasized cross-platform storytelling, noting that actors would portray their characters "across all forms of media--including video games." While there has been little public movement since then, Gunn recently confirmed that there is "slight movement on different things." That could mean we're headed toward a future where David Corenswet voices Superman in both film and other media, although Gunn didn't discuss specifics concerning Corenswet or anyone else.</p><p>“We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about--and in early stages of planning--some bigger things," Gunn told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time."</p><p>Both Gunn and Peter Safran are taking a proactive role in shaping DC's gaming future. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">Back in February</a>, Safran gave an outlook on how they're trying to course-correct the situation and give fans must-play games again.</p><p>"James and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios…whether it's NetherRealm or whether it's Rocksteady, sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in," Safran shared.</p><p>Gunn also admitted then that any major release is "at least a couple of years" away, but in the meantime, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">Rocksteady is said to be returning to its single-player Batman roots for its next project</a>, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/">WB Games is now focusing its efforts and resources on its biggest franchises</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been so anticipated for so many years that it's become a meme, crowding the chat of every major game showcase of the last seven years. While we've had recent glimpses, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d70c00a-ace5-4c4a-a1c2-b92d36666a68" data-entity-substitution="canonical">like the announcement that it was coming to Switch 2</a>, we haven't heard a concrete update from Team Cherry since&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">its announcement that it wouldn't be releasing in 2023</a>. This week, that will finally change.</p><p>Team Cherry's official YouTube channel has a premiere set for Thursday, August 21, at 10:30 AM ET/ 7:30 AM PT. Its title reads, "Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement," while the caption simply reads, "The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!" It is unclear what exactly this announcement will involve, but fans are mostly just hoping for a release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Despite the general lack of information, Silksong is playable at this year's Gamescom,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/#:~:text=Play%20Hollow%20Knight%3A%20Silksong%20with%20a%20new%20demo%20%E2%80%93%20on%20PC%20or%20ROG%20Xbox%20Ally%20X">according to Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/microsoft-partners-with-asus-for-dedicated-handheld-xbox-device">it will be available on Microsoft's ROG ALLY device</a>, so we're expecting some kind of announcement during Opening Night Live in a few hours. Geoff Keighley seemed to support this by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">posting a photo with a clown nose</a>, potentially referencing the meme of Hollow Knight's protagonist in clown attire that's posted whenever we don't get news about its sequel.&nbsp;</p><p>However, partnered with this announcement is a series of Bluesky posts from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who is known for accurately digging up information from behind the scenes of the games industry. Not only does he claim to have "the story behind why Silksong took seven years to make," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr5gpfhkk2x">citing a video call he did with Team Cherry's founders earlier this month</a>, he also says, "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4xi2x5c2g">No, Silksong's release date will not be announced</a> today at Gamescom Opening Night Live, despite Geoff Keighley's teasing." Team Cherry's Thursday announcement will come after Opening Night Live, however, so there's a chance we might get a date then. While Schreier has a solid track record in this line of work, none of this is confirmed, so take it all with a grain of salt.</p><p>Regardless of when it drops or what this trailer will bring, people will be there to watch it. With 15,000 in the YouTube audience a full 47 hours before it even happens, it's safe to say this is one of the most anticipated games of the decade. Here's hoping Team Cherry gives them something to get excited about.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/19/hollow-knight-silksong-special-announcement-set-for-august-21]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/">Delta Force</a> is officially out now for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, after the release date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-this-august-season-break-update-arrives-in-july/">confirmed this past June</a>. As part of the console launch celebration, developer Team Jade has debuted a suite of console-exclusive rewards for players jumping in on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Delta Force | Console Launch - Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGWaElM2BQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Delta Force arrives with full crossplay support between consoles and PC, though you can opt out of crossplay if you'd rather not play against PC players. </p>



<p>The shooter runs at 60 FPS on both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S devices, though PS5 Pro players will be able to enjoy the game at unspecified higher frame rates later this year through a forthcoming patch. If you want to get a taste of a higher frame rate for Delta Force on your PS5 Pro now though, a press release for the news recommends you disable vertical sync to unlock the game's frame rate.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Delta Force includes console-exclusive rewards. Image credit: Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p>Along with the main multiplayer Warfare and Operations game modes, players will also be able to dive into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-campaign-to-launch-on-february-21/">recently launched</a> Black Hawk Down campaign mode as free DLC for Delta Force.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto played the campaign earlier this year in a hands-on preview</a> ahead of its release, he called it "<em>a drastic shift in both technology and pacing from the multiplayer experience that players might have to take a moment and recognize that they’re getting two distinct gameplay experiences in the same package.</em>"</p>



<p>Now players on consoles can experience the campaign, and everything else Delta Force has to offer alongside PC players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>developer Team Cherry has teased a major announcement regarding the game, and it's coming in just a couple of days as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media</a>, Team Cherry says that in just 48 hours, a "special announcement" regarding&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be made. I'd wager anything that we'll finally be getting a release date for one of the most hotly-anticipated indie games of all time.</p>

<p>The announcement will take the form of a YouTube video, so that pretty much cements the idea that we're getting a release date; after all, I doubt Team Cherry would make this much of a song and dance just for a fresh look at&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=DbLXeY9R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=oOFuScC_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date could finally be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long, strange road for&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in February 2019</a> (yes, it really has been that long), the followup to 2017's celebrated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>has been in development for a long time.</p>

<p>Each year that went by after&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s initial announcement saw excitement around the game grow, even though&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">release date</a> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">nowhere to be seen</a>.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is still Steam's most-followed game, clocking up 356,387 followers. By contrast, the platform's second most-followed game is&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, which has 217,811 followers.</p>

<p>Excitement rose again when&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was included as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">summer showcase this year</a>, as well as the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal event back in April</a>, although again, neither presentation brought with it that ever-elusive&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date.</p>




<p>It can't be easy for Team Cherry;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is easily the most-hyped indie game on the scene right now, and it's hard to imagine anything living up to the astronomical expectations many will have for the platformer.</p>

<p>Still, things are definitely moving forward now, at any rate. We'll almost certainly get to learn when&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is arriving later this week, so stay tuned for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>And, just like that, we’re back. Welcome once again to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, stories you might have missed, and more. This morning, we have bad news about PlayStation Plus, good news about<em> Helldivers 2,</em> strange news about that PlayDate console, and sad news about the state of video games as brainrot meme games continue to take over everything. But hey, at least that new <em>Conjuring</em> movie looks like it might be pretty good?</p> <h2><strong>A <em>Fortnite</em> clone of <em>Roblox’s</em> <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> is super popular</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Steal A Brainrot</a></em> has become one of the most popular games on <em>Roblox</em>, leading to kids throwing tantrums when someone…well, steals their brainrot. And now, someone has created a clone that’s become one of the most popular games on <em>Fortnite</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-brainrotted-roblox-clone-is-dominating-the-fortnite-charts/1100-6534047/">At one point, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/island?code=3225-0366-8885"><em>Fortnite</em> knock-off had over 180,000 active players.</a> That would put it in the top five on the Steam charts.</p> <p>And all this popularity has led to a flood of brain-rotting slop. There are clones filling up <em>Fortnite’s</em> creative mode. And if you look around other storefronts and games with user-generated content, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">you’ll see that knockoff brain-rotting games are truly everywhere</a>. It’s totally awesome and not at all horrible that so much of the video game industry is now entirely based around random users chasing the algorithm and exploiting kids playing stuff on their iPad.</p>

 <h2><strong>Eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus in a few weeks</strong></h2> <p>Sony has announced that eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus Extra’s library on September 16. Sadly, one of the games going away is <em>Plucky Squir</em>e, a solid adventure with some impressive visual flair. Here’s the full list:</p> <ul> <li><em>UFC 5&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>The Plucky Squire</em></li> <li><em>Night in the Woods&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Pistol Whip&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</em></li> <li><em>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Dragon’s Crown Pro</em></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Game Boy emulation is now possible on the PlayDate</strong></h2>   <p>The PlayDate might not be the best-selling console around, but it is one of the coolest. And now the black-and-white handheld with a huge library of exclusive games (and a crank!) can do something very cool: Play original Game Boy games. Of course, not officially. Neither Nintendo nor the people behind the PlayDate are involved.&nbsp; But instead, a small group has created “<a href="https://github.com/CrankBoyHQ/crankboy-app">CrankBoy,” a free, fast, and high-performance Game Boy emulator</a> that works perfectly on the PlayDate and its sharp black-and-white screen.</p> <h2><strong>Some of <em>Halo’s</em> best guns will soon be available in <em>Helldivers 2</em></strong></h2> <p>We knew <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> content was coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em> as part of the game’s leap from PS5 to Xbox later this month. But now,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-warbond-xbox-launch/"> Xbox has revealed more details about the crossover DLC</a>, and while I’m happy to see the iconic ODST armor arriving in<em> Helldivers 2</em>, the bigger news is that four guns from <em>Halo</em> are coming to the co-op sci-fi shooter, too. This includes the franchise’s famous assault rifle, but more importantly, it includes <em>ODST’s </em>wonderful&nbsp;SOCOM pistol, aka that cool silenced pistol that goes “pip pip pip” and drops Grunts cleanly. I’m hopping back into <em>Helldivers 2</em>, baby.</p> <h2>Valve is adding six new characters to its hero shooter thing known as <em>Deadlock</em></h2> <p>Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-steam-hero-shooter-moba-release-date-1851631341"><em>Deadlock</em></a>? It was that secret hero-based MOBA-shooter Valve sort of released, but in a weird way. Well, <em>Deadlock</em> continues to grow, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/669466707009471267?l=english">game’s latest update is one of its biggest</a>. It adds a whole new lobby area for players to explore between matches and a new character, a deadly but stylish vampire. Plus, Valve plans to add five new characters to the game over the next few days. Perhaps it’s time I play some more <em>Deadlock</em>?</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-original-heroes-new-characters-2000618254">The devs behind <em>Marvel Rivals</em> might start adding original characters</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-2000618215">No,<em> God of War</em>‘s director didn’t tease a new game; it was all a hoax</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-servers-150-players-100-songs-seasons-summer-2000618257"><em>Skate 4</em> will support 150 players all skating at once</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Incredible Demo Scene - Making Art with Code" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIQ74_DRWEM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i></a> <span>fans, this is not a drill. We’re actually getting an update on </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel that has gone so long without an update that the act of anticipating it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219"><span>has become a meme</span></a><span> almost as common as making </span><i><span>Half-Life 3 </span></i><span>jokes in the chat section of every industry livestream. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>may appear at today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-gamescom-2025-livestream-what-time-fallout-black-ops-7-2000618270"><span>Gamescom showcase</span></a><span>, but it looks like developer Team Cherry also has something else to share on Thursday.</span></p> <p><span>The studio has scheduled a YouTube video to go up on Thursday, August 21, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time titled “Special Announcement.” There’s really nothing else to go on here beyond a logo and a chat log of people already excitedly waiting for whatever the video is. However, given that the game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121"><span>playable at Gamescom</span></a><span>, there’s enough reason to be cautiously optimistic that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is finally, after all this time, imminent, and coming to a console near you. Here’s the scheduled video if you want to save it for Thursday, or just hang out with the rest of the sickos waiting in the chat.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong </span></i><span>was first announced in 2019, just two years after the original game launched in 2017. Since then, the game’s absence from any and every video game showcase has been felt so deeply that hoping and praying for its arrival has become an ongoing joke for the series’ fans, as well as passersby who loved to clown on fans every time the game didn’t show up. Now, it seems, the drought is finally over. Hopefully, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is coming soon. If it is, you’ll be able to play it just about anywhere, as the game is coming to both current and last-gen consoles, as well as PC, Mac, and Linux devices. Strap in, folks. After six years of waiting, the ride is about to begin.</span></p>

takes all the core features of the headset's standard model and gives it a Gengar-themed makeover with a new multi-tone purple color scheme and ornate Gengar ear pieces on top of the headband, and RGB-lit rings and Gengar decals on the outside of the earcups. The RGB lighting elements support Razer Chroma desktop app, so you can change the color and program them to react to gameplay.</p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Like other models of the headset, the Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition uses Razer's proprietary TriForce 40mm audio drivers and HyperClear Cardioid mic. It also supports 7.1 virtual surround sound on PC (requires Windows 10 or higher). The headband and earcups use hybrid fabric and leatherette cushioning, which provides some passive noise isolation for a more immersive listen. While Windows PC users will get the most feature support, it can be connected via wired USB-A to other devices as well, including consoles, Mac computers, and more. That means Switch and Switch 2 users looking to pick up the headset ahead of Pokemon Legends: Z-A will be able to plug into their consoles while in docked mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The Razer Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition headset is dropping just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-pokemon-limited-edition-gaming-keyboard-mouse-headset-revealed/1100-6533218/" data-ref-id="1100-6533218">Razer's Pokemon Collection</a> that launched last month. The collection includes gaming mice, mechanical keyboards, headsets, and other accessories that sport unique designs featuring Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.

The first game came out all the way back in 1996, on March 22 to be precise, with many games having been released in the meantime. There's obviously a new game releasing next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but it seems that aside from putting out a new entry, Capcom is also planning … something for the series' 30th anniversary. A <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html" rel="nofollow ">new anniversary website</a> is now available for you to peruse, only right now there's not much to look at.</p><p dir="ltr">At the top of the site is a beautiful piece of art showcasing the game's numerous protagonists, like Leon Kennedy, Claire and Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Ada Wong, and Resident Evil Requiem's main character Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Apart from that, there's what appears to be a 30th-anniversary logo next to some text that simply reads, "2026 marks the 30th anniversary of the Resident Evil series!" There's also a drawing of a raccoon wearing sunglasses also commemorating the 30th anniversary, in front of a spinning disc that says, "coming soon … " on it.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Resident Evil Requiem is due out February 27 next year, you probably shouldn't expect a big new game announcement, but some appropriately themed merchandise does seem likely at the very least. Given that the anniversary is only about seven months away, it probably won't be too long until we find out what Capcom has planned.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has unveiled Kirby Air Riders in a new Direct presentation, following a brief trailer back in April. The game is set for release on 20th November this year on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation was classic Masahiro Sakurai, creator of both the Kirby and Smash Bros. series. At 45 minutes long, it was an extensive look at what appears to be quite a simplistic racing game, bringing to mind those old Smash Bros. Ultimate character reveals spending forever detailing every move. And with a familiar structure and graphic design, it felt like an extension of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-ending-his-acclaimed-youtube-series-this-month">game design YouTube channel</a> he's been running the past few years.</p>
<p>"Why is making a game so hard?", Sakurai amusingly questioned at the beginning of the Direct, later declaring "This game is quite fun!" while playing, as if surprised by his own handiwork.</p>

<p>As for the game itself, it's a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> - a racing spin-off for the titular character that released on GameCube over 20 years ago - and sees players riding on magical stars around courses, sucking up enemies for special abilities, and speed boosting around colourful courses.</p>
<p>But no, it's nothing like Mario Kart. Sakurai said so!</p>
<p>What makes the game different is the simplicity of the controls - just like the previous game, only one button is used. Acceleration is automatic, meaning the stick is used purely for steering, while a single button is used to brake before releasing for a speed boost - that's how you drift around corners. Get close enough to enemies and the same button is used for sucking up their abilities and attacking them.</p><p>There are a number of tweaks for this follow-up, though. Firstly a second button has been introduced, though this is used purely for initiating unique special abilities. Secondly, as the "Riders" in the title suggests, players can this time race as a number of different characters from across the Kirby universe - not just differently coloured Kirbys - each with their own attributes. That includes the likes of King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, and Chef Kawasaki. Special abilities range from speed boosts to extravagant attacks.</p>
<p>Players can also select from a wide variety of star vehicles to race on, some hovering and some with wheels. Again, each has different forms and traits, with alternative acceleration techniques as well as speed and handling. These combine with characters for combined stats. How very... Mario Kart.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Sakurai remains as charming and meticulous as ever | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Air Ride is the main mode and sees six racers competing around courses. These range from the floral Floria Fields, to the cavernous Cavernous Corners, and the cybernetic Cyberion Highway. Players collect stars to boost their speed, which can be hoovered up in opponents' slipstreams or gained by defeating enemies. A number of options will allow players to customise the format, including the number of laps and even the game speed.</p><p>The main event, though, will be City Trial. This pseudo battle royale mode returns from the original, but is now playable with 16 players online (local wireless play will support only eight players, but another eight CPU can be added). In this mode, players explore an open map - it's called Skyah - for five minutes to collect as many stat-boosting buffs as possible. These are gathered around the map, as are various machines to ride on, as well as specific events like racing, battles, and defeating bosses.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Here's Sakurai checking out his own game | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then players enter stadiums to compete in minigames, based on the stats buffed in the previous stage. These are a bit like the Smash Bros. stadiums, with minigames including flying as far as you can off a ramp, racing in a straight line to the finish, or gaining top points flying through targets. Players will be given four stadiums to choose from, with Sakurai suggesting strategy and mind games you can use. Players then advance to their chosen selection, but you can even receive an automatic win if you're the only person to choose a stadium. Fewer players means voting for just one stadium, though this option can be turned off.</p>
<p>In all, Kirby Air Riders looks to offer some fun and flashy racing along with a dynamic exploration mode. "So, did it come through that this isn't just a humorous racing game?" Sakurai asked at the end, seemingly taking a dig at Mario Kart. Whether it addresses criticism of the original game and its overly simplistic gameplay, we don't have long to find out. Until then, check out Kirby Air Riders' theme tune on the Nintendo Music app.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> "Special Announcement" from developer Team Cherry is planned for Thursday, with the video set to run on YouTube at 3.30pm BST on 21st August.</p>

<p>The news of a "Special Announcement" on Silksong comes after speculation (not unwarranted) that the game would be shown off during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> ONL tonight, with a release date potentially being revealed.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier‬ posted on Bluesky to confirm that Silksong would not be having its release date revealed tonight:</p>
<p>"No, Silksong's release date will not be announced today at Gamescom Opening Night Live, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s teasing," read the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4xi2x5c2g">post</a>. That still leaves the window open for a look at Silksong gameplay tonight during ONL, but the big news will be saved for Thursday.</p>

<p>Yep, with the Switch 2 game introducing a whole swathe of Kirby characters to the racer, to make things "fair", now Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Cappy — among many others — will be able to inhale enemies on the course and take their powers.</p>
<p>In Kirby Air Riders, Copy Abilities can be used offensively or to boost your speed. So far, we've seen Fire, Sword, Bomb, Wheel, Mike, Cutter, Jet, Steel Ball, and Plasma, and we're sure many more will be shown off as we approach the game's release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Launching on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>, the box art isn't really anything surprising; it's basically a variation of the main key art we've seen since the initial Switch 2 Direct back in April. Still, it looks lovely! Like most major Nintendo games these days, it's likely there won't be any regional differences for this one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for those looking to purchase the game on the eShop, you can expect it to take up a total of <strong>25GB</strong> on your Switch 2 storage.</p>
<p>As for the price, it'll cost <strong>$69.99</strong> in the US and <strong>£58.99</strong> in the UK. It's not currently known whether the physical edition will be more expensive, but we'll let you know as soon as we can.</p>

			<p>Halo is coming to PlayStation, but not in the way <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">you might have been hoping for</a>, at least for now. A new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/">Helldivers 2 warbond</a> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">game's arrival on Xbox next week</a> brings the look of Halo: ODST to Super Earth's brave Helldivers across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>If you showed a gamer from 20 years ago the following trailer, where a Halo-related announcement began with the PlayStation Studios logo, they'd be shocked and awed. But in 2025, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded set to arrive on PS5 next week</a>, and several previously Xbox-exclusive titles already on PlayStation, it's far less surprising, but no less fun to see for anyone who remembers what the divide between platforms felt like 20 years ago.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O_9hwQ8jLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The warbond will feature classic Halo weapons like the MA5C Assault Rifle and the M6C/SOCOM Pistol, and the ODST-styled armor set that Halo fans know so well. It'll also feature new capes, armor passive, player banners and a player title.</p>

<p>The warbond will be available the same day that Helldivers 2 arrives on Xbox Series X/S, on August 26, 2025. Which is also the same day that Gears of War: Reloaded will arrive on PlayStation 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kirby Air Riders Release Date Set for November, Tons of New Info Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kirby-air-riders-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-release-date-set-for-november-tons-of-new-info-revealed.1273776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed a ton of new information about upcoming racing sequel <i>Kirby Air Riders</i>, including when you can expect to play the game.</p>

<p>In a new Nintendo Direct presentation aired earlier today, Nintendo, along with&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>director (and Nintendo legend) Masahiro Sakurai, revealed that&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>will be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20th.</p>

<p>Along with revealing the release date, Sakurai and Nintendo also divulged lots of new info about&nbsp;<em>Air Riders</em>' gameplay mechanics, characters, and game modes, and it sounds like the game will boast Sakurai's usual maximalist design philosophy (which is definitely a good thing!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=JxorEaKP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=Ng6yfY_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>is launching in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>takes the form of a sort of auto-racer; you won't need to press any buttons to accelerate, but you will need to perform maneuvers to outfox your opponents, use specials to gain advantages, and more.</p>

<p>Each rider has different stats; Kirby, for instance, has a different weight stat to King Dedede, who won't feel the same to play as Meta Knight. You'll need to weigh up which racer you want to use on which course if you want to win.</p>

<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Ride&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll probably recognize the returning City Trial mode, which has been expanded; it now takes place on a massive floating island by the name of Skyah, which is a free-roaming map packed with events to enjoy.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also be able to take part in the game's titular Air Ride mode, which sees you and up to five other riders competing to cross the finish line, as well as other gameplay modes to try out.</p>




<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>' release in November means it's one of two major Nintendo racing games to be released during the Switch 2's launch window, with the other naturally being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch game&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 exclusive list is getting longer with the racing game <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> coming to the console on November 20th. Today, Nintendo offered a luxurious 45 minutes devoted to its<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"> cutest pink blob</a> who, when you think about it, is really an eldritch horror of incalculable power. Here are the highlights from the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct.</p><p>Before even getting to the action of <em>Air Riders</em>, we were greeted with a smiling but tired sigh <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch">from director (and Kirby’s dad) Masahiro Sakurai</a>. He explained that he was approached to lead <em>Air Riders</em> while he was working on <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> DLC, and that the new Kirby is a collaboration between his studio Sora and Bandai Namco.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> takes the original GameCube classic and modernizes it for the Switch 2. You can choose many more riders to play as instead of just Kirby including King Dedede, Banana Waddle Dee, and some cool-looking guy I just heard of named Knuckle Joe. The game also supports up to eight players in local wireless play or up to 16 players online.</p><p>And what will you do with those other 15 players? There’s races, point challenges, battle arenas, and good ole’ fashioned exploration. In <em>Air Riders</em> you can choose any number of racing machines, each with their own unique traits, and upgrade them to your hearts content. Is your paper glider machine too fragile? Spend some time exploring, gathering power ups to make it beefier. Then use your newly improved machine in a challenge designed to take advantage of your racer’s new stats.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the first game directed by Masahiro Sakurai ever since<a href="https://kotaku.com/please-for-the-love-of-god-let-masahiro-sakurai-rest-1845241032"> Nintendo’s tiredest soldier</a> finished up work on<em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. In the interim, he’s been<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23320915/masahiro-sakurai-youtube-channel-creating-games"> running a series of educational videos on YouTube</a> sharing his experiences and lessons learned in game development while also, apparently, directing A<em>ir Riders. </em></p><p>That <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is showing up now along with *<strong>inhales</strong>* <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, has bolstered my<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23205240/kirby-dream-buffet-nintendo-wholesome"> Kirby Theory of Distress</a> which hypothesizes that Nintendo releases a Kirby game whenever the world is in worse than average trouble. Kirby comes to save us once again in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> launching on the Switch 2 November 20th.</p><p>In the meantime, Switch Online subscribers can get an early taste of the game’s soundtrack through the Nintendo Music app, which just added seven tracks ahead of <em>Air Riders</em>’ launch.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761317/kirby-air-riders-release-date-november]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The latest update for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> begins with an apology. Recognizing that communication with players hasn’t been Funcom’s strong suit of late, the developer explains that it’s in part because of “state mandated” vacations.</p> <p>“I apologize if people feel the communication around issues with the game has been lacking,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/515218419125060312">the latest update posted to Steam</a> (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dune-awakening-promises-an-endgame-overhaul-and-says-communication-has-been-bad-because-developers-had-state-mandated-vacations/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “We are focused on improving this. With a percentage of the team having their well-earned (and state mandated) vacations, customer service and the community team have not always had access to developers who can answer their every question.”</p> <p>If you’ve ever been on a trip to Norway (and Sweden) during July, you’ll have learned the hard way (I speak from experience) that <em>everything is closed</em>. This is a result of <em>fellesferie</em>, the annual summer “common holidays” where just about everyone takes their vacation at the same time. Which is quite mad, but for Norwegians, entirely ordinary. It’s normal for offices to just close down in July, and people who do persist in working during the month will struggle if they rely on suoport from their colleagues. It appears to be <em>fellesferie</em><em>&nbsp;</em>that’s affected&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p>

 <p>Regarding the enforced nature of these vacations, Norway has something called the The Holiday Act, that mandates all employees receive 25 days of vacation a year, meaning it’s even more tricky to prevent an entire team all disappearing off at once.</p> <p>“We’ve been playing whack-a-mole with bugs, cheats and exploits during the July month of summer,” says Funcom. “We’ve banned thousands of cheaters, fixed a bunch of duplication and exploit bugs and continued working on the stability of the game. We’ve been working to achieve a cadence of patches that allows us time to make stable and consistent fixes, while being fast enough to address issues like exploits before they get too far out of control. Live Game development is a blend of reactivity and long term planning.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618409">© Funcom</figcaption></figure> <p>While players have loved <em>Awakening</em>, there’s been a lot of dissatisfaction around what there is to do once the main content is finished. Funcom explains that its Gamescom news is going to be focused on the Chapter 2 Free Update and The Lost Harvest DLC, neither of which will affect the endgame, saying, “this is because Chapter 2 and the DLC were planned and began development before launch.” But, it goes on to list what’s happening in the later stages.</p>

 <p>It seems the big problem facing Funcom, other than an empty office, is that&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> has drawn in what it describes as “very different demographics,” who all want something different from the MMO’s endgame. However, the issues are boiled down to “loss of items/vehicles, players feeling that they are forced into PvP, exploits and cheats, and lack of endgame content/grind.” Arriving soon are the following changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Improved Player Logging</b>&nbsp;– One of the key frustrations we see is the lack of information and clarity around why certain items/objects/vehicles are gone. We will increase the information in your logs so that you have a better idea of what is going on. For example, listing the names of people who take things from chests in your base.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Vehicle Salvaging System</b>&nbsp;– We’re working on a vehicle salvaging system that will allow you to recover lost vehicles.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Cobalt Paste/Vehicle Inventory&nbsp;</b>– We’re adjusting the volume of the infamous cobalt paste and adding more slots to the Assault Ornithopter vehicle inventory. We will be adding a cargo container that can be carried by the Carrier Ornithopter.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Instanced Deep Desert Loot</b>&nbsp;– The constant camping and queuing of the Deep Desert Testing Stations leads to a frustrating experience where people arrive at an empty Testing Station. We’re going to change these to be more in line with the rest of the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Offline Notifications about important events&nbsp;</b>– We understand that not everybody can or wants to log in to check power/taxes constantly in the game. We would like to create a notification service that sends you the status of your base via email. This one is squarely aimed at you, Ben.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The post then continues with longer-term plans for endgame content:</p> <blockquote> <p>As we’ve mentioned previously, the Landsraad is supposed to be the endgame activity driver. Currently it does not have the breadth or depth of content or progression to serve that function. As we work towards Chapter 3, we will begin to tie the faction progression of the game to the Landsraad, while also systematically building out the Landsraad with a greater variety of activities across the world.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As a player this means that you can increase your faction rank by completing Landsraad tasks, checking in with your Duke or Baron occasionally to perform special missions and visit faction vendors.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>Landsraad activities will become contract based, rather than delivery based, which will allow us to effectively remove the issue of stockpiling that is currently endemic in the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>This ensures that people are rewarded for solo play (as well as making contributions easier for them to track) and will give you many choices in how you progress over time.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As for the planned activities, we have plenty in mind in addition to the current testing stations and shipwrecks. The following list contains examples, and not promises, as these will take work and time to deliver. But currently we are thinking of things like: Assassinations, Treasure Maps, Races, Construction Challenges, Duels, Faction vs Faction maps, Improved control points, Scavenger Hunts, Temporary Crafting Challenges etc.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>These activities will make use of the Overland Map, spawning in new maps as required. We have always wanted to flesh out the Overland Map over time, and this will boost that along.</p> <p>Of course, we are open to your suggestions so please share with us on social media the kinds of activities you would like to see in the Landsraad.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As the Landsraad activities become more fleshed out, we will then transition the Deep Desert back towards the original intention – a sandbox area where players can compete for control of the spice. We will continue to iterate on the Deep Desert – adding no-fly zones to enforce ground combat, adding more layouts with more variety and challenge, and ensuring that there is clear progression. In addition, we are experimenting with the tech behind the Deep Desert and if things go well, you will experience the Deep Desert in a much more stable environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>This will apparently be the focus for the rest of 2025, now everyone’s back in the office. Before they all take off again for Christmas.</p>

              <p><span>I never really think of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>as a great game for recreating other movies and music videos until I see the lengths some creators go to use Nintendo’s life sim as their movie studio. I’ve been obsessed with Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> for the past month, and several nights a week I’ll find myself scrolling through my feeds looking for reaction videos, covers, and other indulgences to feed my ongoing brainrot. Now, I’ve found an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>channel that is recreating all the movie’s musical numbers in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, and I’m mostly just surprised at the creative solutions they came up with to make up for the game’s lack of fantasy weaponry and demons.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone who’s played </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>knows that it has some pretty robust creative options in terms of outfit design, character customization, and even set creation. Where the challenge lies in recreating something like a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>music video is in finding animations, items, and characters that can at least somewhat emulate things that don’t exist in the game. YouTuber Magic Studios, who has recreated almost every musical moment in the film, has managed to use the tools in </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>to creatively represent actions like demon fighting and skydiving from a busted plane, and, to the best of their ability, tried to capture the film’s choreography.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: What It Sounds Like (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKk9WeRNXxg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of the most clever details will likely hit hardest for people who have both seen the movie and put an exorbitant amount of time into perfecting their </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>island, such as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-tom-nook-is-misunderstood-506751609"><span>money-loving tanuki Tom Nook</span></a><span> representing Gwi-ma, the demon king final boss that the Kpop girl group Huntr/x faces in the finale. My favorite part of these videos, however, is seeing how Magic Studios recreated different costumes for both the main cast and side characters using </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>’ Custom Designs feature. Some videos are more elaborate than others, like the “Golden” music video which faithfully recreates the movie’s pre-performance hype cycle as the girls are promoting the upcoming single.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: GOLDEN (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arDp3X_5lyg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>You can check out all of Magic Studios’ </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> videos </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@magicstudios7112"><span>on their channel</span></a><span>. The film is streaming on Netflix and is now the </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>second-most-popular movie ever on the platform</span></a><span>. If you can still grab tickets, Netflix is putting the movie in theaters this weekend for a limited-time sing-along event.</span></p>
