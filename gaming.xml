And once again, not everyone made it out alive this week. Turns out rebellions are dangerous. Here’s our conversation about <em>Andor </em>episodes 4-6.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Carolyn Petit</strong>: Last week I said that I really hoped Cassian would get to play a more active, central role in this chunk of episodes, and he certainly did, but I’m gonna kick things off by sidelining him anyway because I want to start with our boy Syril. </p><p>I have to admit, the first 15 minutes or so of episode 4 really had me going. I thought we might see that petty fascist fuck undergo a profound awakening, that maybe his experiences on Ghorman had opened his eyes to the evils of the Empire and provoked a moral crisis within him. They got me good with him telling his mother that she’s been watching too much “Imperial news”—I love the idea of the Empire having its own propagandistic media arm, it totally makes sense that it would, and I know so many folks who have seen their own parents be brain-poisoned by exposure to Fox News so his concern rang true for me—only for this to be revealed as part of the long, elaborate con he’s running with Dedra. </p><p>Did y’all think there might be some good somewhere deep in Syril, or was I the only one naive enough to fall for it?</p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: I also bought it for a bit. And I have some thoughts on that which I’ll mention later, but yeah, I was like “Okay, maybe he’s better!” Nope.</p><p>I loved the one resistance guy who was listening in on his call, remarking on how terrifying his mother sounded. Made me chuckle hard.</p><p>Ethan, did Syril trick you like us? Or did you see through it.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: I was totally hoodwinked, just like the naïve bourgeoisie turned budding rebels Ghormans Cassian chides later on. </p><p>I did appreciate the time spent showing us his new art deco office. Parts of the brief-case carrying Mise-en-scène are very reminiscent of Mad Men. Ghorman is quiet beautiful, and the romanticism of its underground freedom fighter movement cuts an interesting contrast with Bix and Cassian’s claustrophobic safe house on Coruscant.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think it was really smart of Gilroy and co to make Ghorman basically space France and show the rebels as the French Resistance. It immediately conveyed what was happening here without having to spend too much time explaining the details.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes! The show is very deft with its kind of revolutionary politics shorthand, cluing us in to the ways it draws on historical events and famous thinkers while still being believably rooted in <em>Star Wars.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>And to Ethan’s point, one thing I really appreciated across all three of these episodes was <em>Andor’s </em>use of physical space and real sets. Having that plaza on Ghorman with its hotel and café and twillery showroom helped make everything there feel more concrete, from the bellhop’s story about remembering the Tarkin Massacre to the action of that tragic covert op at the end. </p><p>And while Ghorman was often sunny and open, Bix and Cassian’s safehouse was, as you say Ethan, claustrophobic, the lighting there often reminding me of what we see in Deckard’s apartment in<em> Blade Runner</em>, very urban and gray. The show is a visual treat in addition to everything else, and for me it makes such a difference that it doesn’t rely too heavily on the kinds of (admittedly pretty effective) techniques that <em>The Mandalorian </em>often employed.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I really loved that Ghorman was a big set. I didn’t realize how much I miss <em>Star Wars </em>having big sets filled with aliens and people in the background. By the end of the three episodes I felt like I understood that part of the planet/city and could probably walk around it and not get lost.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Yea you got a lot of your silly aliens this week Zack. However, Mon Mothma is no Nancy Pelosi when it comes to whipping votes.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I was so happy to see all those alien senators and weirdos. That’s<em> Star Wars,</em> baby. And yeah, poor Mon Mothma. The reveal that the person she’s talking to and trying to get a vote from is Ghorman’s own senator. Damn.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Those Ghormans are in a tight spot, no doubt about it.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>At least they live in a very walkable city with lots of nice cafes Though, based on how easily Bix and Andor get around in the dreary depths of Coruscant, I think that giant city is walkable, too. I was also excited to see what, I think, is our first on-screen bodega in <em>Star Wars.</em></p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I kept wondering how anyone picks what bar to go to on a single-city planet.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes! In fact that’s one of the things I love about <em>Andor </em>in general. By being focused so much on the lives of relatively “ordinary” people—sure, people who get swept up in revolutionary struggle but not Jedi or bounty hunters or what have you—it’s informing our understanding so much of what life is like for ordinary people in the galaxy. Oh look, they have bad daytime TV shows! Oh look, they watch sports (podracing) when they should be doing their jobs!</p><p>That to me is way more interesting territory to explore about that “galaxy far, far away” than, I don’t know, more details about the life of Boba Fett.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Yes, the moment where Bix woke up to a  crappy morning talk show was very relatable.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Saw Gerrera, on the other hand, feels like he needs his own animated spin-off. Forest Whitaker creating a more compelling <em>Star Wars</em> in less than 15 minutes than most of the new trilogy.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Ethan, let me introduce you to <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> and <em>Star Wars Clone Wars. </em>But yes, Saw was great in these three episodes. It was also nice to finally find out why he was so fucked up in <em>Rogue On</em>e. We had theories and half answers. Turns out: Dude was huffing space jet fuel and getting wicked high. That’s fun. Good for him.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Forest Whitaker is such an incredible actor, and I was so glad to see him finally get to bring the full force of his talent to this role. </p><p>I admit I only know Saw from <em>Rogue One </em>and now <em>Andor </em>(not counting his little appearance in <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em>), and I’ve always wanted to understand what drove him better, and have a better handle on his politics and on what he brings to the struggle. Part of me felt that his presence in<em> Rogue One </em>could be interpreted as kind of a warning, that little neoliberal tsk-tsk of “sure everyone, fighting fascist oppression is good but you don’t want to go too far with it.” </p><p>But in <em>Andor</em>, because it can take the time to flesh out characters like Luthen, Saw, Kleya, Mon Mothma, and others, all of whom have their own ethics and perspectives, it’s not as big of a deal to me if Saw is a little out there at times.</p><p><strong>EG</strong>: I could use one or two more VFX shots to better establish scope of his insurgency. Show me the battalion pieces on a chess board.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d03a859854f3a9ab32966e1364b43b4" data-recommend-id="image://8d03a859854f3a9ab32966e1364b43b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="835" data-height="467" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Benthic Two Tubes stands against a rocky background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Benthic Two Tubes stands against a rocky background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Two Tubes!</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d03a859854f3a9ab32966e1364b43b4" data-recommend-id="image://8d03a859854f3a9ab32966e1364b43b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="835" data-height="467" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Benthic Two Tubes stands against a rocky background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>CP: </strong>Also, what a great little ragtag band of freedom fighters he’s got with him. Give it up for Two Tubes!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Two Tubes!</p><p>Once again, I think this chunk of episodes really did a fantastic job of showing us that the rebellion isn’t this unified thing that we see eventually in the OG movies.</p><p>It’s still messy, spread out, disorganized, and sometimes directly at odds with each other and their methods. And I hope by the end of the series we see them coming together just in time for the Rebels’ first big victory against the Empire as seen in <em>Rogue One.</em></p><p>Also, can we talk about how great Kleya is?! She’s been one of the best parts of the show since season 1, but I feel like these three episodes, in particular the party sequence, gave us more Kleya and I’m happy about that.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes. I’ve always sort of gotten the feeling that she’s doing more to drive things forward for the Rebellion than the show has let on, but here we finally really saw the steel and determination in her, both in her holding her own against Luthen in arguments and in her actions at the party.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> The scene where she is squeezing the hidden mic so hard that her hand starts to bleed was one of the best moments in show. That whole sequence was so tense, too.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> And then Luthen saying how much is face hurt from smiling.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>It was tense, the show building to climactic points on multiple fronts and then playing them against each other. I’m fully on board with the three-episode release structure at this point, because it really does seem like each of these clusters has its own internal conflicts that pay off in the third episode while also contributing to the season in bigger ways.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Agreed! Speaking of that moment with Luthen and Kleya, I wanted to shout out the “We should have killed Krennic” comment.</p><p>It was nice to see them both laugh and joke together. But it also felt like Luthen might be a bit of a hypocritic, with his stance against relationships in the rebellion. I wonder if by the end of this season he’s going to have to reckon with how much he cares about Kleya.</p><p>I can almost imagine a scenario where Kleya sacrifices herself to some Imperial asshole to save Luthen from getting caught, taking the fall and in the process scarifying her life and freedom for the cause.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I assume the link up with Rogue One means Luthen is not going to make it. Speaking of people who don’t make it...</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I think Luthen can make it. Just because he’s not there doesn’t me he’s dead. And are you are talking about Bix?</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Cinta!</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Okay, yeah, let’s talk about Cinta.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Ohhh right right. I guess she isn’t making after being shot dead. </p><p>I was so happy to see her back in this episode. And to have her go out like that was heartbreaking. But I don’t agree with some who say her death was handled poorly. I think like Brasso, her death was an example that nobody is safe in a rebellion and death can come quickly. Heroes don’t always get big moments. Sometimes they just die quietly because of a dumb kid or a single trooper. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> She’s always been the most laser focused on the cause, and puts it above even her relationship with Vel. Her loss seemed fittingly chaotic and self-inflicted, but I think she also knew that was a possibility and made the choice anyway, unlike some of the rebels who still have only one foot in that world.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I do wonder how she’ll react when she finds out (if she does) that Andor said no to helping which put her and Cinta into this spot.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>I saw the critique raised that her death was a textbook example of the “Bury Your Gays” trope, but while I think being aware of such tropes can be useful for perceiving larger patterns that repeat—sometimes innocuously, sometimes harmfully—across popular media, I personally don’t care to criticize Andor specifically for having Cinta die. </p><p>She was a character we cared deeply about, she’s one of many characters who have died (and no doubt more will yet), and I feel the show earned that moment, which, as you suggest Zack, may have repercussions in the episodes to come.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Totally. And look, its not like<em> Star Wars </em>has a good track record (in live-action at least) for representing LGBTQ+ characters. So I do have empathy for people who finally saw themselves in<em> Star Wars </em>in a way that is so rare in this franchise, only to have one of them killed like that.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Absolutely.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> But I also agree that the death had meaning, will likely be one of many to come, and might factor into future events. So I’m not sure it is a negative example of the trope. </p><p>Something we also don’t see much in <em>Star Wars</em>: Sex. Or well... the moments before sex. Syril and Dedra’s moment in her apartment. “Turn off the lights.”</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Hahaha, when we finally do get a prelude to sex it’s the most awkward prelude imaginable between the most awkward people imaginable.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I really wonder what... <em>that </em>looks like.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>It’s interesting in a way to contrast their relationship with the one between Cassian and Bix.</p><p>Both are brought together to some degree by common cause but Cassian and Bix’s connection feels so much more warm and human, even though there’s tension and conflict there sometimes. </p><p>Thematically, this week’s episodes reminded me a lot of one of my all-time favorite shows, <em>The Americans.</em> On that show, the central couple—Russian spies posing as an American couple—always had to put on phony identities and disguises and engage in deception and performance on multiple levels. And on this week’s <em>Andor </em>episodes, we had Cassian take on a totally fake identity and deal with complications in his relationship, while Dedra and Syril are also engaged in these layers of deception for their operation. </p><p>And in that dynamic, Dedra seems to be operating at one level of deception beyond Syril; to him, they’re partners of a sort, but I feel like to her, maybe he’s just a pawn.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Speaking of Syril, I do want to call out that the actor who plays him mentioned in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/3ihBfycg8Wg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/3ihBfycg8Wg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent behind the scenes video</a></span> that Syril doesn’t really know what’s going on. This is something that the show also mentions. And the actor suggests that if Syril was to learn the trurh about Ghroman and being used like that, he might not like it. I wonder if that’s a hint that perhaps Syril will turn before the show ends. </p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I’m not sure if I hope you’re right or wrong there, Zack. Part of me wants to see him redeem himself in some way, and part of me just loves to hate him for the sniveling fascist that he is.</p><p>Before we wrap up, I also want to mention Cassian and Bix’s little excursion. It’s funny to find an execution like that romantic but in a way I did. Cassian is devoted to Bix, and will gladly blow up a motherfucker for her. It was one more thing that made the dynamic between the two of them such a wonderful contrast with the kind of clammy, off-putting energy that pulls Dedra and Syril together.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Yes! I loved that ending. I also appreciated how the show trusted us to connect to dots on how they found him, etc. And that moment where she sits the evil space-Nazi doctor in his torture chair and gets her revenge was great. </p><p>I especially like that last minute reveal of Andor. At first I was like, wait is she going rogue? But no, they are a great couple, he trusts her, and they get shit done. It goes against what Luthen worries about. It turns out having someone on your side, someone you love and trust, can be a strength in a rebellion. </p><p><strong>CP: </strong>That’s exactly right. And in a way I think this ties into the larger arcs of <em>Star Wars</em> as well, such as the Jedi focus on a lack of attachment or love as seemingly a state to be pursued. We’ve seen the toll that can take. </p><p>Ultimately, what are all these characters fighting for, from Luke Skywalker to Cassian Andor to Saw Gerrera and Luthen and on and on? Not for themselves. Many of them know they probably won’t make it. You fight for each other, and loving other people should, it seems to me, be at the core of that. I think you’re right that even Luthen will come to realize this to some degree before all is said and done.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Stellan Skarsgård mentioned in that same behind the scenes video I mentioned earlier, that Luthen checking on Bix is an example of him having empathy. And he points out that Luthen has to have empathy because that’s the entire point of a rebellion. You care about others so much you are willing to die for them to save them. That’s empathy. Luthen is cold at times. But he does care. </p><p>And I’m excited to see more of him and the rest of the gang next week!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in a time when it’s not exactly uncommon to have your routine shattered by the sudden, resounding death knell of a publication that taught you your whole worldview, but two in one day? Come on. That’s exactly what happened this week when both <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giant Bomb</a>, beloved games media institutions, got gutted within hours of one another. The internet is descending into a sea of slop, and this is how it happens: one sacrifice to the almighty Line at a time. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we mourn what was.</p><p>None of this was, strictly speaking, necessary, with Polygon an unqualified success in terms of traffic while Giant Bomb boasted a dedicated audience drawn to its unique mix of personalities. But of course, parasitic execs decided to suck the marrow from the bones of both, and now we’re left wondering what comes next. Independent, worker-owned sites like ours hope to pave a path toward a better future, but that will take a lot of time, and many excellent writers are out of work right now. In the short term, nobody benefits from this. Even influencers who claim to dislike journalists rely on them for content, and due to vastly different incentive structures, content creation is doing a poor job of taking journalism’s place.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in less soul-crushing news, we discuss this year’s latest surprise hit, <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-nathan-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely French J’RPG <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, which we do our best to celebrate despite the dour mood. Finally, we wrap up with the longest mailbag in the show’s history, so get comfortable.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday afford to hire everybody who’s been laid off and let them do whatever their hearts desire. In other words, absolute freak shit.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> You definitely have a lot of executives who obviously don’t understand media in general. That’s <a href="https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “Adults In The Room” post</a>, talking about people who on one hand ostensibly are the leaders of these websites, but on the other hand do not trust the people who are writing things – who are creating what basically is the appeal of the website – to understand what would be best for the website.</p><p>But then there’s another layer to it with games in that execs don’t even have a frame of reference for the subject matter. Like if you’re an exec at G/O Media back in the day with Deadspin, you’re like “Well, I know sports vaguely. I grew up with sports. They’re all around me. I know how to play some of them because I went to school.” Whereas a lot of these executives with video games are like “Well yeah, I’ve heard of <em>Mario </em>and <em>Fruit Ninja</em>” – or something else incredibly basic that’s not really indicative at all of the breadth and scope of video games in the year 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>So from this very narrow point of view, they imagine that people who read about games just want reviews and guides. There’s probably nothing else happening in the games industry; it’s not like it’s bigger than Hollywood or anything. Because their imagination is so limited and their understanding is so incurious, this is where you end up. They’re like “Oh yeah, I’m sure you can just get rid of all these people who are intrinsic to the site’s identity and slap the same label on some different guides.” Because it’s all interchangeable to them. It’s all the same slop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>This is every industry, though, right? Enough generations of business leaders have had their brains so commodified by business school “number go up” [rationale] that numbers going up is the only thing that matters. The fact that those numbers are actually representative of the actions and the work of people was lost a long time ago.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, they will look at the numbers and think the guides are this, they’re worth this much money, or they’re going to be worth this much money. Valnet look at Polygon’s guides and think they’re worth X amount of money, and they will now have that money. And it’s like, well, no you won’t, because the people who wrote those guides, which made them good, which provided those numbers are gone, you fucking idiots. You’re not getting what you paid for, because you’re only looking at numbers. You’re not looking at people.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The thing that’s so frustrating about today is that you have two tragedies stacked on top of each other, and it makes the more recent one – the bigger one, honestly – take priority, but it is the same dynamic with Giant Bomb. In that case, it’s like, brand safety? They got mad at them for brand safety. They’re Giant Bomb! Why would you buy them if you don’t like them cursing and shit?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> While we’ve been recording this, Giant Bomb, the brand, put out a statement – a very short one that basically elucidates nothing. They <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/giantbomb.bsky.social/post/3lo55ow25dc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “We understand your frustration and appreciate your patience — we're actively exploring creative directions for the future of GB and look forward to sharing more with you soon.” After a week of internal upheaval and clear unrest, that’s the best they could come up with.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That sounds just like their voice, too. When I think of Giant Bomb, I think of shit like that. And replies have been disabled.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The whole thing is especially weird to me in Giant Bomb’s case, because it points to this tension between a wider shift in the media landscape and what the owners of these sites seem to want. Media has moved, for better and for worse, in a very personality driven direction, which is why so many people get their news from influencers in video games and outside of video games. Meanwhile, a lot of people who are buying up these sites are like “No, we’ve gotta strip away as much personality as possible,” whether it’s this brand safety thing for Giant Bomb, or Kotaku, for example, not letting writers do personal game-of-the-year lists anymore. Because that gives them too much of a face and a name, I guess.</p><p>One of these things is proven to work, which is personalities; that’s what people are into now. But personalities are hard to control, and they can become bigger than the site in question and gain more power. The people in charge are so afraid of individuals gaining power that they’re like “I will shoot myself in the foot just to make sure that you can’t carve out a space for yourself.” It is deranged and again goes back to this idea that these people do not know what they’re doing and are not even good at running a business. Because the thing that would help them is clear as day, but they’re too afraid to do it, because they’re too afraid of losing power. It’s all about power.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soccer-mommy-stardew-valley"><h3>Soccer Mommy’s Guide To Stardew Valley, The Coziest Video Game Ever</h3></a><p>The open-hearted indie rocker plays the farming game for the romance</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale"><h3>Polygon Sold To Valnet</h3></a><p>Multiple staff laid off</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturers Association has chosen a new home for the GAMA Expo. Due to rising attendance, this tabletop convention, one of the largest in North America, will come to Baltimore in the future.</p>

<h2>The GAMA Expo Location Change</h2>

<p>In a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/05/01/gama-picks-baltimore-as-new-home-for-annual-gama-expo-after-trade-event-quickly-outgrows-new-louisville-home/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, GAMA's site selection committee chose Baltimore out of 30 potential cities as the future venue for the GAMA Expo. According to a representative, the expo had doubled in size since 2023. The last year held at its original venue in Reno, Nevada, resulted in over 2,000 attendants.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-expo-show-floor-banner.jpg?itok=tav0D7OG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-expo-show-floor-banner.jpg?itok=AsNXSmQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a result of this growth, the GAMA Expo was moved to Louisville, Kentucky for their 2024 and 2025 conventions. While this choice was made based on historical data, attendance blew past the organization's original projections. The attendance of this year's expo rose to 3,420.</p>

<p>This venue change will not happen immediately. GAMA signed a three-year contract in Louisville for 2024 to 2026. An extension was made to 2027 as part of the city recognizing the organization had outgrown the footprint available across the original dates. That means that, for the time being, the GAMA Expo will be in Louisville until that contract expires.</p>

<p>The Game Manufacturers Association is one of the largest tabletop organizations in the US. They are a vocally progressive organization, suspending known alt-right grifter <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jon Del Arroz</a> from their ranks and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">expressly opposing</a> the disastrous US trade tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

<p>The fact the GAMA Expo continues to see growth in attendance and talent is a welcome one in the tabletop industry. It is one contrasted with the harsh realities of publishers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shutting down</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filing lawsuits</a> amind a volatile present and uncertain future. However, this does show that there is still a passionate community willing to give more creative talents a voice and platform.</p>

These armored soldiers are the Empire’s main fighting force and show up in just about every piece of <em>Star Wars </em>media out there, including games, books, comics, and of course movies. But they aren’t all the same. There are many variants of these iconic troopers. Let’s rank them all from best to worst. </p><p>Some quick ground rules: We are only focused on canon trooper variants. (Sorry, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation_zone_assault_trooper&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation_zone_assault_trooper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radtroopers</a></span>.) We’re also not including any clones or First Order variants on here. If I included every non-Imperial variant, this list would be twice as long. Nobody wants that.

You’ll get to build your own bundle by picking from a catalog of 18 titles, and the more you pick the more you’ll save. As a bonus, Fanatical will toss in a 5% off voucher for your next purchase. All games are offered as official Steam keys.</p><p>Cashing in on the offer is simple. Buy three or more games and they’ll cost $3.33 each, five or more for $3.00 each, or seven or more for $2.85 each. Prices will automatically adjust as you add more to your cart. There's no limit to how many you can add, and if you pick all 18, you'll pay just $51.30, which is a huge savings compared to the full bundle's $385 value.</p><p>As for the games available, The Forgotten City is one of the most compelling options. Released in 2021, the story-rich RPG has you rewinding time and attempting to figure out who destroyed an ancient city in the Roman Empire. Combat is one way to get your answers, but it’s often a better choice to charm, bribe, or interrogate your subjects. There’s no one way to navigate its challenges, making it excellent for multiple playthroughs.</p><p>Faith: The Unholy Trinity has earned Overwhelming Positive reviews on Steam, and it’s an easy recommendation as part of this bundle. With minimalist, retro graphics and a chilling story about demonic possession, it’s a great addition to any Steam library. Inspired by classic 8-bit games and the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, horror fans will find much to love about this unsettling adventure.</p><p>Other notable games include the roguelike boomershooter Ziggurat 2, the puzzle-platformer Deliver Us Mars, and the hilarious Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom. You could also check out Teslagrad Remastered and Teslagrad 2 with the Double Pack. The metroidvanias earned impressive reviews, thanks to vibrant graphics, heaps of unlockable skills, and surprisingly nuanced storylines.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/everspace-2-wrath-of-the-ancients-price-drop-tariffs-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a brief reprieve, clearly-senile mostly-king Trump is once again <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lo2dloetgk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frothing at the mouth with tariff madness</a>, which means that goods we take for granted are on the verge of becoming a lot more expensive. While <a href="https://kotaku.com/atari-2600-cartridges-price-tariffs-trump-1851778562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many are raising prices</a> and others are waiting to see exactly how the chips fall, Hamburg-based Rockfish Games, the studio behind <em>Everspace 2</em>, decided to lower – not raise – the price of upcoming expansion <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873470/EVERSPACE_2__Wrath_of_the_Ancients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wrath Of The Ancients</em></a> by $5 in advance of its May release date.&nbsp;</p><p>"If that fiver means more ramen in your pantry, we get and respect that," the studio wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent Steam post</a>, noting that the preemptive price drop was inspired by the fact that “everything is getting more expensive, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general.” As a result, the expansion will cost $25 at launch instead of $30 as originally planned.&nbsp;In addition, the studio is also dropping the price of a previous <em>Everspace 2</em> DLC, <em>Titans</em>, from $15 to $12.</p><p>Rockfish co-founder and CEO Michael Schade told Aftermath that this unconventional approach comes with a degree of risk, but he feels like his studio is well equipped to navigate it.</p><p>"Speaking from a business perspective, we may be cutting into our longtail which we might make up in earlier copies sold, but this change in price really isn’t about that,” Schade said. “As a studio, we felt too many things in the world were getting too expensive, too fast. This is a very small way to change that. In the long term, we might be leaving some money on the table, but in the short term, there are a lot more space fans out there who might be able to play earlier, make their gaming budget go further supporting indie studios like ours, or just use that extra money for necessities. That means a lot to the team, so we’re making it work.”&nbsp;</p><p>What’s on offer in <em>Wrath Of The Ancients</em>, Rockfish has been careful to clarify, is not changing. It remains a substantial expansion, with four new star systems, a new player ship, a new story campaign, new side missions, new secrets, and new loot. “The expansion is roughly a third of the size of the base game,” Schade said, adding that he felt like it more than warranted its initial $30 price tag.</p><p>Schade repeatedly emphasized that this was a team decision enabled by Rockfish’s independence.</p><p>“As an independent studio who isn’t relying on a publisher for a fairly successful project or having to please investors that often just focus on the bottom line, this is something we can do,” he said. “We’re privileged to be in this situation and hope that the industry returns to a place where more studios are on steadier ground.”</p><p>Despite <em>Everspace 2: Wrath Of The Ancients</em>’ incredible shrinking price tag, Schade is among the growing chorus of industry voices that believes that – commensurate with inflation and the rising cost of development – video game prices should be going up, not down.</p><p>“Overall, as video game developers, especially indie studios making larger projects, we should be charging more for what we make, which is hard for the general gaming audience to stomach, especially as personal budgets get tighter,” he said. “There are some extremely successful examples out there of single-developer or small teams doing very well off very low-priced novel titles, but in general, many of the kinds of games people are seeking cost a lot to make.”</p><p>For now, though, developers are getting creative. Many, Rockfish included, release games and expansions on Steam with optional cosmetics, soundtracks, art books, and other add-ons that allow appreciative fans to kick in an extra few bucks if they so choose. These, Schade explained, don’t rake in cash hand over fist, but they do cushion the bottom line a little.&nbsp;</p><p>“As far as a meaningful impact on the overall business, I would say things like the artbook, soundtrack, and supporter pack really don’t change our lives, but they are valuable,” he said. “They’re a great way for fans to get a little more of the music, art, or cosmetics they want and they help us build resource reservoirs to fund free updates, extra content, and future titles.”</p><p>It remains to be seen how <em>Wrath Of The Ancients</em>’ pre-release price drop will impact Rockfish – and how the full brunt of Trump’s tariffs will impact, you know, the world – but for now, Schade is pleased with how <em>Everspace </em>fans have reacted to the announcement.</p><p>“Funnily enough, our community had virtually no objections to the initial price announcement, and we’ve had more than a few comments from fans saying they wish they could support us by paying the initial high price,” he said. “Unexpected, but nice to hear.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soccer-mommy-stardew-valley"><h3>Soccer Mommy’s Guide To Stardew Valley, The Coziest Video Game Ever</h3></a><p>The open-hearted indie rocker plays the farming game for the romance</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale"><h3>Polygon Sold To Valnet</h3></a><p>Multiple staff laid off</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft has announced the next big update for Halo Infinite, and it introduces one of the more absurd and over-the-top weapons we've ever seen in Halo's history.</p><p>Say hello to the Mutilator, a new brute force weapon featuring a double-barrel shotgun with a Gravity Hammer attached to the end of it. The gun shoots one shell at a time or players can leverage the alt-fire option to shoot two rounds at once. As for the Gravity Hammer element of the gun, Microsoft said, "If there's anything left to devastate, the hammer should finish the job." You can see the new weapon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmrvG8Zmsb4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in action in this Halo Infinite video, beginning at 46:50</a>. It looks pretty devastating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4487074-screenshot2025-05-02at3.03.18pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4487074" data-ratio="0.56315179606025" data-width="863" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4487074-screenshot2025-05-02at3.03.18pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4487074"></a><figcaption>The Mutilator</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4487074-screenshot2025-05-02at3.03.18pm.png"></figure><p>Microsoft created a dedicated mode to highlight the Mutilator, and it's called Mutilator Madness. It's a variant of the Juggernaut mode where a team of players square off against one super-powerful player.</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft is adding the Mutilator to regular Halo Infinite maps as a power weapon. Players can also use the weapon in custom matches and in Forge mode.</p><p>The Mutilator is coming to Halo Infinite on May 6 as part of the game's upcoming Operation: Last Stand update. The update also incudes a 20-tier free Operation Pass that allows players to unlock a variety of new cosmetics, while a paid 50-tier Premium Operation Pass will be available with even more content.</p><p>The Weapons Bench is getting updated, too, allowing players to apply weapon coatings, emblems, charms, and death effects to a variety of weapons. What's more, the Last Stand update brings back bouncing bullets so that projectiles from the S7 sniper rifle and the Flexfire sniper rifle will ricochet off hard surfaces, making the battlefield even more dangerous.</p><p>Additionally, the Last Stand update has nerfed the Banshee vehicle by raising the cooldown time for its fuel rod cannon and slowing down the velocity of its projectiles. "We hope these nudges will ensure a more balanced experience for all players. Ramming speed remains unchanged," Microsoft said.</p><p>Beyond ongoing updates for Halo Infinite, Microsoft is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">all-new Halo games using the Unreal Engine 5.</a> It's still early days, however, and no new Halo games have been official announced as of yet.</p>

		<p>During Future Games Show LATAM, Run Games announced and shadow dropped a new free to play multiplayer football game called Football Heroes League. It seems to be inspired by Rocket League but with actual football instead of cars. We have essentially come full circle and can dub this Rocket League with people.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Heroes League - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHC8edyMwhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Football Heroes League, you can compete in 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 matches to score the most goals and win. There is also a training mode to get to grips with the controls, and an instant replay system will be added soon. Players can currently choose from a roster of five heroes, with more to be added during the game’s early access phase. The five heroes available at the moment are Kenzo, Beckers, Leo, Frostine, and Bun-E, and each of them has a special ability. Kenzo has jet boots to give him super speed, Beckers has mag boots to control the ball direction so she can in theory bend it like Beckham, Leo has the strength to get passed opponents, Frostine is able to freeze opponents, and Bun-E commands BunBots that can be used to assist in defence and attack. I bet VAR wouldn’t be able to cope with all of these shenanigans.</p>
<p>If you do want to give Football Heroes League a go, you can download it for free now on PC at the following links:</p>

Dell, for instance, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/microsoft-corporation-xbox-series-x-1tb-white/apd/ad180049/gaming-gaming-accessories/" rel="sponsored">is still offering</a> the digital-only<strong> Xbox Series X (1TB)</strong> for $449.99, saving you $100 on the new MSRP. The smaller, 512GB <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> is also available at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S-512GB-SSD-All-Digital-Gaming-Console-Robot-White%2F11213159055%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> for just $273.99 ($106 off), while the 1TB model is going for $347 ($83 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Series-S-1TB-White%2F9606813888" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.</p><p>In case you need a refresher, the Series X is more powerful and capable than the smaller Xbox Series S. The Series X offers support for native 4K resolution, for example, while the smaller Series S is primarily designed for 1440p gaming.

Considering this version of the game is only $40 (compared to $30 for the base game), that’s a pretty impressive list of additional goodies.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">TMNT: Splintered Fate - Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$100 | Releases August 26</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Splintered Fate's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F77PTLFD,B0F779FGK9,B0F77HZCNR,B0F77Q43B4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition</a> includes a bunch of additional extras.

		<p>Developer Killasoft has revealed The Shadow Syndicate which has been described as a stealth action game set in 1930’s Brooklyn. You can check out the reveal trailer below from Future Games Show LATAM, with the footage giving a look at some gameplay and the noir kind of feel that you would expect from a detective game set in the 1930s.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Shadow Syndicate - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcxW7qOesd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Shadow Syndicate’s description says,<em> “The Shadow Syndicate is a narrative-driven stealth-action game set in a stylized 1930s Brooklyn. Step into the shoes of Sam Marlowe, a retired soldier turned private detective, as he unravels a city-wide conspiracy involving secret societies, occult forces, and a creeping darkness threatening to consume it all. Sneak, fight, and investigate through a rich cinematic experience blending noir storytelling with supernatural abilities and fast-paced action. Use your cursed Sacrifice Ring to unleash powerful skills—at a cost. Explore a living open city between missions, filled with colorful characters, mini-games, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.”</em></p>
<p>The gameplay will consist of investigating areas for clues, solving puzzles in your notebook, interrogating characters for information, and getting into gunfights. The combat will feature bullet time as well as supernatural abilities that will let Sam stun enemies, teleport, or instantly kill enemies. However, using these abilities builds up a deadly curse that will have consequences for Sam. Outside of the main story you take on side quests or you can go around Brooklyn to go bowling, play darts, or play blackjack.</p>

<p>A release date for The Shadow Syndicate is yet to be confirmed but it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>It's a big day in the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>, as Microsoft has added another Call of Duty game to the subscription service. Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the 2022 game) joined the Game Pass catalog, and it includes the full experience covering single-player and multiplayer.</p><p>MW2 is the third Call of Duty game that Game Pass subscribers can play via the subscription service. It joins Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3. The battle royale title Call of Duty: Warzone is a free game that anyone can play--including Game Pass members--though it's not strictly a Game Pass title.</p><p>Modern Warfare 2 is playable on Game Pass via PC and Xbox.</p><p>Modern Warfare 2 was developed by Infinity Ward and is a sequel to the 2019 Modern Warfare reboot.

It's quite unlike anything else in the long-running series, and even if it falters more often than usual, it's still essential for anyone who's previously called Kamurocho home.”</p><p>This isn’t the only premium edition discounted for Gaming Week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 02/05/2025:</strong> According to <a href="https://it.ign.com/chrono-trigger/217954/news/square-enix-potrebbe-essere-al-lavoro-su-un-remake-di-chrono-trigger-si-attende-lufficialita">IGN Italy</a>, Yuji Horii's words about a Chrono Trigger Remake were, "<em>I understand there is also a remake in development</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Quest series creator and Chrono Trigger writer Yuji Horii seems to have accidentally confirmed that a Chrono Trigger Remake is on the way at a panel during Napoli Comicon.</p>
<p>Spotted by<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chrono-trigger-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-yuji-horii/"> Insider-Gaming</a>, users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> who were at the panel heard Horii, through a translator, confirm the existence of a Chrono Trigger Remake. He only realized his mistake after the panel host asked to confirm what he had just said. When his translator put the follow-up question to Horii, he covered his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>The next thing his translator reportedly said was, "<em>You have heard nothing</em>." Earlier this year, on March 11, 2025, Square Enix celebrated the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a>, though the celebrations were not limited to a single day. At the time, Square confirmed that the celebrations would include "<em>various projects</em>," and now it seems we know what at least one of those projects is.</p>
<p>Now that Horii's comments are beginning to spread, it'll be interesting to see if Square Enix is quick to respond with an official confirmation, or if they'll stick to the marketing plan they have, and wait to announce the remake when they had originally planned.</p>
<p>The surprise of the remake might be gone, but the excitement fans have for it certainly isn't. Chrono Trigger is regarded as one of the best and most influential games in video game history, and is one of the few games of its time that has yet to get a proper remake. If anything, it's reassuring to know that Square Enix was well aware of the fact that Chrono Trigger is deserving of the same treatment that Dragon Quest III got, if that is the kind of remake they're making, of course.</p>

The Switch 2 Dock has two USB-A ports, so you <em>should </em>be able to use Hori's wheels to play Mario Kart World. Wired and Bluetooth Switch controllers are supposed to work just fine on Switch 2, and this should especially be true when dealing with officially licensed accessories like Hori's Mario Kart wheels.</p><p>We have reached out to Hori to confirm Switch 2 compatibility and will update this story if we hear back. Just know that there is a chance neither wheel will work on Switch 2.

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">The Shadow Syndicate</a> is a new game from indie developer KillaSoft, announced during the Future Game Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam. Playing as a grizzled husky detective, you'll solve the mystery and supernatural conspiracy at the heart of its 1930s Brooklyn setting.</p>
<p>A narrative-driven game, The Shadow Syndicate, will have you paying attention to clues, talking to the other animals in Brooklyn, and breaking a few skulls through third-person shooting, with the help of a good amount of bullet-time action when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>You'll play as retired soldier turned private detective Sam Marlowe, discovering what turns out to be a city-wide supernatural conspiracy with secret societies, occult powers, and some mysterious darkness that threatens to consume Brooklyn.</p>
<p>But you're not just bringing a gun to a magic fight, as your Sacrifice Ring lets you use a slew of powerful abilities. However, it should come as no surprise that using something called the 'Sacrifice Ring' comes at a cost. Each power will strengthen you, but they all come with a deadly curse that will loom over you with each ability gained.</p>
<p>There were several games shown off during the Future Games Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam, but The Shadow Syndicate was both one of the most interesting games shown and one of the few brand-new announcements. Hopefully, we will hear more about it soon.</p>
<p>The Shadow Syndicate is currently set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.</p>

It’s useful when you’re running a sniper class, allowing you to swap out your secondary pistol for an additional primary weapon. In this case, I recommend a submachine gun for its high-rate-of-fire and close-quarters capabilities. You never know when someone’s going to sneak up on you!</p><hr><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Season 3 is available now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Deadlock--the MOBA that Valve famously did not acknowledge after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-valves-rumored-moba-shooter-deadlock-leaks-online-showing-off-steampunk-action/1100-6523639/">months of leaked footage</a>, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/">confirm its existence last summer</a>--has been slowly inviting more and more players to its ongoing closed alpha test. However, it now seems as if there's an even more hidden alpha test, with even more limited invitations, after a streamer accidentally spilled the beans.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Deathy was livestreaming Deadlock on his YouTube channel, when he seems to have booted up the wrong version of the game. Instead of the alpha test viewers were used to, instead the game loaded up additional characters--a roster of 40 available characters as opposed to the standard alpha's 30 playable heroes--as well as updated designs for some of those 30 heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the characters not found in the usual alpha test include a bellhop-themed character named Doorman, a reference to Mary Shelley's famous monster called Frank, and a character named Punkgoat whose art is a repeat of existing character Shiv. Deathy did end the stream and delete the archive when he realized his error, but screenshots still managed to hit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1kckaic/slight_oversight_from_the_deathy_tierlist/" rel="nofollow ">official Deadlock subreddit</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadlock is a 6v6 multiplayer shooter and MOBA--"multiplayer online battle arena"--game developed by Valve. The official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> says that the game is "in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay" and that "access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters."</p>

I’m just trying to save you money while Microsoft is out here <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">increasing the prices of everything</a>, including its controllers.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->20</span></p><div><p>8BitDo’s wired Ultimate C Controller packs plenty of features for the price, including drift-free Hall effect sticks, a 3.5mm audio jack, and slick RBG lighting around both joysticks.</p></div></div><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate features Hall effect joysticks and triggers, which means there aren’t any moving parts inside that might degrade over time. So, they should last a bit longer than the default controller that comes with your Xbox. Other features include four sets of vibration motors, RGB lighting around the joysticks (I, for one, am a big fan of glowing lights), and customizable button mapping with support for different game profiles.</p><p>A wired joystick probably isn’t for everyone, but it can make some things easier. If you’re moving from an Xbox to PC, or even an Android phone, for example, you can just plug and play without needing to re-pair a Bluetooth connection. And you don’t have to worry about your batteries dying mid-match.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
