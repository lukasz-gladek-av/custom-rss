            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>brings the franchise to the shores of Japan. After almost 20 years and 13 mainline games, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> — the series about using flashy gadgets and techniques to murder your enemies undetected — has finally been set in a place famous for assassins who use flashy gadgets and techniques to murder their enemies undetected. I don’t know why Ubisoft waited so long. But I do know Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">in</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283677/ubisoft-nft-game-champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-sequence">dire</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314843/keepin-it-all-in-the-family">need</a> of a hit, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is poised to be one.</p><p>Ubisoft isn’t out to reinvent the formula with <em>Shadows</em>. In fact, there’s nothing mechanically (or even narratively) that separates this game from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906187/assassins-creed-mirage-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <em>Mirage</em></a>. It’s just moved the game to a new location, with new characters and storylines. The strength of the game comes from whether Ubisoft can make those things pop.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155451/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-trailer-ubisoft"><em>Shadows</em> revives the dual protagonist system</a> introduced with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9602584/assassins-creed-syndicate-review"><em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em></a>. To start the game, you play as Naoe, a young woman from Iga, a province of medieval Japan known for its shinobi. After her village is destroyed and her father is murdered, Naoe swears revenge on the shadowy cabal of masked individuals responsible. Her quest for vengeance brings her into contact with Yasuke, a former enslaved man searching for his place in life as a samurai in the service of Japan’s premier warlord of the time, Oda Nobunaga. </p><p>After about the first 10 hours of the game, which are focused on Naoe, players are allowed to swap freely between Naoe and Yasuke and their wildly different styles of gameplay. Naoe is the stealth character; she’s quick and light on her feet, able to scale buildings with the use of her grappling hook and assassinate her enemies from the shadows (heh) with her hidden blade. Yasuke is the bruiser, able to take a beating and dish one out in turn with massive heavy weapons like the naginata, long katana, and musket-style firearms known as teppo.</p><p>Ubisoft did a good job of tuning both character’s skills and abilities such that both have elements that make them appealing to play. I really liked how Yasuke and Naoe, in addition to being engaging characters with narratives I enjoyed watching develop, are suited for specific jobs and my moment-to-moment moods. If I’m short on patience or I know I’m going up against elite enemies with chunky health bars, I’ll barrel them over with Yasuke, teppo blazing. But if I don’t feel like knock-down, drag-out fights or I’m after a tasty bit of treasure well guarded by a swarm of enemies, that’s a job for Naoe, who can get in and out without rousing any alarm.</p><p>But just because Yasuke and Naoe have their own strengths doesn’t mean they can’t play to their weaknesses. It was just as satisfying, if not more so, to make the burly Yasuke pop out of a bush to stealthily stab a guy (although, with him, it’s less of a light stab and more like an impalement) or have Naoe hold her own against the tough bosses. I had a very hearty laugh when I made Yasuke do his first leap of faith, a well-known <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> staple that has characters trust-fall from high-up observation points into bales of hay or other soft landings.</p><p>For both characters, combat is a simple, standard affair, wherein players can string together light or heavy attacks interspersed with special abilities specific to their character or weapon. In particular, I was surprised by how brutal Yasuke’s combat was. In trying out the naginata for the first time, I was shocked by the violence of his finisher that has him stomp on his enemy’s head, as though running him through the chest the moment before wasn’t enough to get the job done. It was a level of goriness I associate more with <em>Mortal Kombat</em> than <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. </p><p>There was another jarring moment very early in the game that highlighted the tension between <em>Shadows</em> as a product designed to make money and an artistic endeavor. Within seconds of starting the game, it presented a gallery of assassins from previous titles. I thought each entry would play a cutscene that would summarize the game’s story. Instead, selecting any of the entries kicked me out of <em>Shadows</em> and into the PlayStation Store, where I was prompted to buy the game I wanted to learn about. (Ostensibly, if you own the game, selecting its entry would launch it.) I thought it was a bad omen, setting the tone for a game stuffed with the kind of nickel-and-dime live-service bullshit that Ubisoft is known for.</p><p>But with <em>Shadows</em>, I finally <em>get</em> the franchise. I’ve never liked open-world games. With few exceptions, I find them tedious and overwhelming, especially Ubisoft’s particular flavor of them that are littered with side quests and activities that are little more than busywork. <em>Shadows</em> is similarly constructed. It’s the same kind of gameplay in the same kind of open world — with a map so cluttered with <em>things </em>that looking at it made me anxious.</p><p>Yet, I didn’t mind any of that. Partly, it’s the narrative: I find Yasuke and Naoe’s banter to be sweet and funny, and their story of learning to work together makes for a perfectly fine <em>Odd Couple</em>-style narrative. But even that’s not enough. It’s the world. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release">with previous <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a>, Ubisoft has invested time into recreating this era of Japan with exacting detail. Locations are rendered from their real-life counterparts and given codex entries that delve into their stories with a historian’s level of specificity. Quests that touch on cultural elements, such as the tea ceremony, are similarly reconstructed with the same level of gravity. The locations and events are not treated as mere set dressing, but as living, breathing entities invested with the same weight and respect as they are in real life. When you encounter the first torii gate, the game warns you to respect what the structure represents by not climbing all over it, and it feels good honoring that request. That level of care is why, 35 hours in, I haven’t grown tired of what is, on pixel, unforgivable tedium. </p><p>I enjoyed traversing the way-too-big map, finding all the little activities I could get into while on my way to the bigger story quests. I was thrilled every time the seasons changed and I got to see the land transform. Every bit of scenery is rendered with such detail that I felt transported to an era of Japan that, despite being covered to death in media, nevertheless remains endlessly fascinating. I was enthralled by the game’s deep and detailed codex that covered everything from the history of the era and its notable figures to the minutia of daily life as a Japanese peasant. Sure, popping out and killing ninjas is great, and I’m genuinely interested in how Yasuke and Naoe achieve their goals. But more than anything, I wanna visit the top of Mount Hiei and learn about the warrior monks of its Enryakuji Temple. We all watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode"><em>Shōgun</em></a> deservedly <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/shogun-wins-best-television-series-drama-2025-golden-globes-1235225689/">carry away all the awards</a>. Playing <em>Shadows</em> felt like experiencing that show all over again. </p><p><sub><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 20th.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is just not having a very good time on PC. The game only launched on Steam just last week, where it was quickly discovered that, oh dear, there are a lot of issues. Just a quick look at the game's reviews will let you in on its myriad of problems, but one of the biggest ones that's cropped up is an issue where <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1340990/discussions/0/828204828240984227/">save files are being completely wiped</a>, obviously quite an annoying bug especially if you've put a lot of time into the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, developer Koei Tecmo shared an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1340990/announcements/detail/616535451664123019">update post on Steam</a> noting that they are aware of the reported save data bug, and that they're "looking into" what's causing the problem. That's all well and good, but they did at least offer a couple of potential temporary solutions to the problem. In one part it could be down to your computer's documents folder being set to file sharing. Turning it off might help, but Koei doesn't guarantee anything. There's also a support page that has more specific details on this particular fix you can check out <a href="https://support.koeitecmo.info/hc/en-us/articles/23580170503193--Steam-Cannot-save-load">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Steam post also includes a way to retrieve your save data by heading to a specific folder on your computer, where you can rename the BACKUP.BIN file to SAVEDATA.BIN to hopefully get it back, but I'll let you read the post rather than explain here and have you complaining at me in the comments that I broke your computer somehow.
</p>
<p>
Steam's Cloud save function might also be able to restore your save, but Koei Tecmo notes that if you're asked which save file to keep, you should rename your local save data and store it somewhere else before using the Cloud data.
</p>
<p>
A proper patch for all of Rise of the Ronin's issues <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/507322442554803882">was promised when it launched on PC last week</a>, which is supposedly coming "soon", though it might still be worth holding off on jumping back in until that update arrives.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-character-is-best-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-yasuke-vs-naoe.1138143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers a dual-protagonist system that presents the player with freedom of choice. Do you want to be the heavy-set warrior, Yasuke, or do you want to be the lithe and agile shinboi, Naoe? Both characters have unique abilities and loadouts, but which of them can be considered <strong>the best character </strong>in Assassin’s Creed Shadows to play as?</p>



<p>Read on to understand these characters and learn which of them is the best protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-vs-naoe-which-character-is-best">Yasuke vs Naoe – Which Character is Best?</h2>



<p>It’s mostly a subjective debate when it comes to determining which of the two Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonists is the best.</p>



<p>If you prefer decimating your enemies with heavy attacks, you’ll probably pick Yasuke. If you’re more of a stealthy player who relies on shadows and subterfuge to achieve your goals, you’ll prefer Naoe.</p>



<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of both characters in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuke</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>High health pool</li>



<li>Incredibly powerful attacks</li>



<li>Can use a bow and teppo (gun)</li>



<li>Can easily dispatch even the toughest enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very slow, cumbersome parkour abilities</li>



<li>Tougher to remain hidden, almost impossible in some circumstances</li>



<li>No eagle vision or hidden blade</li>



<li>Attacks are typically slower and require more planning</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Naoe</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very fast and a fantastic parkour artist</li>



<li>Uses shinobi tools like smoke grenades, grapple hooks, and distraction mechanics to go unseen</li>



<li>Uses a wide range of melee weapons, most of which are designed around speed</li>



<li>Can assassinate enemies and use eagle vision to spot and mark enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low health pool that is a challenge against tough enemies</li>



<li>Limited ranged weapons; can only use Kunai and Shuriken</li>



<li>Less physically dominating and won’t scare enemies as easily</li>
</ul>



<p>In general, I think that Assassin’s Creed fans will gravitate much more readily to Naoe, who represents the creed and what the series stands for. In truth, you’ll be splitting your time between both. However, after around 30 hours in the game at the time of writing, I can honestly and openly say that I’ve preferred my time spent with Naoe.</p>



<p>She’s much faster and more agile, and her parkour abilities are the best the franchise has ever seen. Her skillset makes her incredibly fluid, and the stealth factor with Naoe is off the charts. The only time I actively switch to Yasuke is if I’ve tried to win a fight with Naoe and have lost – if that’s the case, I bring in the hulking samurai to tackle the tougher enemies.</p>



<p>From a cosmetic perspective, I also enjoy Naoe’s outfits more. They’re better suited to the assassin lifestyle, but that’s not to take away from Yasuke’s incredible armour sets.</p>



<p>That’s which character I think is best in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Fans of developer Argonaut's warmly remembered 3D platformer Croc: Legend of the Gobbos are in for a blast of nostalgia; after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-remaster-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">bit of a delay</a>, its previously announced remaster has been given a release date, and is launching for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 2nd April.
</p>
<p>
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, for the uninitiated (or young), launched for the original PlayStation in 1997, taking players - in the guise of the titular crocodile - on a journey through Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante. The resulting adventure wasn't <em>exactly</em> a classic of the genre, but it certainly had fans.
</p>
<p>
And now, Argonaut - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-is-being-remastered-by-resurrected-argonaut-games">resurrected last year</a>, 20 years after its original closure - is revisiting Croc's first outing with a nostalgia-tweaking update. It promises "vibrant high-definition graphics, a modern control and camera system, and refined gameplay mechanics" as players venture across "beautifully recrafted" levels.

That's alongside the addition of a Crocipedia - a "painstakingly curated" digital museum charting the original game's development through design documents, concept art, animation tests, pre-release music tracks, and interviews with developers past and present.
</p>
<p>
If all that's filled you with the giddy warmth of memories past, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos launches digitally for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">PC via GOG</a> on 2nd April, where it'll cost $29.99 USD.

		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is sticking with the action RPG gameplay where gear and loot are a key part of your progression through the game. Weapons and gear come in various types and apply to different gameplay styles, but a basic tanto isn’t going to be anywhere near as good as a legendary tanto, and comes without perks.</p>
<p>Alongside levelling up and gaining Mastery points, you’ll need to look out for legendary chests and more. Here’s what to look for to get the best gear and loot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>

<li><strong><a href="#section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">How to find legendary gear and legendary chests in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</h2>
<p>Shadows has a loot system that uses the familiar common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary item tiers. The higher the tier, the more powerful the piece of equipment, generally speaking, though if you’re particularly lucky and get a good drop, an epic item could be more powerful than a legendary one.</p>


<p>Uncommon items and up come with a perk that can make a big difference, like increaseing armour when health is full, or boosting your damage per adrenaline chunk filled, whilst rare items and better can also be inscribed with another perk of your choice at the forge in your hideout.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the most consistently powerful gear you can count on finding is legendary gear. The stats are betters, the perks are better, and they probably look cooler too. The most consistent way to get it is by opening legendary chests.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to find legendary chests, but most reliably they are found in castles. To open a castle’s legendary chest you first need to defeat all the Samurai Daisho in that castle which can be a little time consuming, but you’ll also find a bunch of resources which you can later use to upgrade your equipment and earn Mastery points, so it’s time well spent!</p>
<p>You can also find legendary chests out in the world, and there are a few things to look out for. First, if you see some soldiers threatening a civilian and kill said soldiers, the civilian will reward you with your choice of either a scout support or some world information. The world information can sometimes give you information about a legendary chest nearby, or a kofun, which is a cave to explore with a legendary chest at the end.</p>
<p>You can also get locations for these chests in kakuregas, which are like outposts where you can fast travel to and restock your equipment. You can get radiant missions from here as well as areas to search for nearby content, such as legendary chests and castles.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p>Remember to pick up as many resources as possible as you play, as on top of the loot’s tier system, they also have levels. Once you’ve built a forge at your hideout you’ll be able to upgrade your gear’s level to ensure it’s still useful after you’ve levelled up a bit. When you upgrade the forge you’ll also be able to inscribe another perk onto rare or better equipment, giving you another modifier of your choice. These perks can be very useful and can be unlocked by completing certain challenges in-game, such as a certain amount of assassinations, as well as be rewards for completing certain quests.</p>
<p>One of the earlier legendary items I found was a tanto for Naoe that, after using a weak point attack (by holding R1 until charged) against a vulnerable enemy, would trigger another vulnerable state afterwards, allowing me to use another weakpoint attack and deal even more damage. As she’s a character that’s much more focused on speed, a skill like this was very useful, so I’ve focused on upgrading it ever since. Once you find an item with a trait that works well for your playstyle, you can keep upgrading it like this until you find a replacement that works even better, or that is so good that it changes how you play.</p>
<hr>
<p>There you have it. Looting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes with the standard item tiers, but you need to keep a look our for Legendary chests to find the best gear, and then keep on top of upgrades to all your weapons and items.</p>

		<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get to play as not one, but two characters whilst assassin-ing your way around feudal Japan. Joining forces to thwart another evil plot, Naoe and Yasuke are both very different in just about every way, from their backgrounds and motivations to combat style, tools, and weaponry. As you switch between the two of them at will, you’ll need to adjust your playstyle to account for their strengths and weaknesses, and depending on your preferred playstyle you might wonder, can you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows only as Naoe or Yasuke?</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Who are Naoe and Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Naoe – the sneaky Ninja Assassin</h3>
<p>Naoe is a trained shinobi who is out for revenge in typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, which means she’s both stealthy and sneaky, and your go-to for anything involving either of those two things. In addition to being small, quick, and not wearing clunky, loud armour, she also has a grappling hook to help reach rooftops and vantage points, and a set of tools – kunai, shurikens, bells, and smoke bombs. Naturally this combination of things makes her ideal for sneaking into a castle and methodically assassinating every poor guard who happens to be on duty.</p>
<p>She’s not useless in combat either. She doesn’t deal huge amounts of damage and might have a bit of a tough time taking out the implausibly giant guards, but she is capable provided you make full use of parrying and posture attacks on vulnerable enemies. She can equip two of a katana, a kusarigama, and a tanto/hidden blade combo to fight with and will need to be light on her feet to ensure she doesn’t get boxed in by enemies. The kusarigama will help with that, as its upgrades give improved crowd control.</p>



<h3>Yasuke – The towering Samurai</h3>
<p>Yasuke, meanwhile, is an actual samurai. And by actual, I mean he is based on a historical figure. The slave of a Portuguese Jesuit before Lord Oda Nobunaga took an interest in him, he became the first black samurai in history.</p>

<p>Yasuke is built for combat. In addition to being head and shoulders above most other people in the game, he can absorb much more damage than Naoe can, thanks to his full suit of samurai armour, and carries more rations to quickly restore health. He can choose between a long katana, a naginata, a kanabo, a yumi bow, and a teppo, which is a shotgun-like rifle.</p>
<p>Yasuke doesn’t have any tools, not even a grappling hook, and if you want a ranged weapon you’ll have to use one of your two weapon slots for a bow or teppo. The bow itself can be silent, but guards tend to find it a bit suspicious to see a giant pointing a bow at them. Yasuke’s biggest weakness is how profoundly un-sneaky he is – when he moves he makes more noise than Naoe, as he’s wearing a lot of armour, he climbs much more slowly, and when attempting a leap of faith he bounces right out of the haystack, though still without taking damage thankfully. However, Yasuke doesn’t need any of this. Stealth? He just wades into a camp and fights everyone at once. Climbing? Please, Yasuke can literally sprint through closed gates, breaking them into pieces.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</h2>
<p>As fun as Yasuke is to play as, rushing right into the thick of the action and battering enemies, his impressive lack of stealth does make Naoe the better fit for the stealthy assassin fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series. Naoe is the better all-rounder.&nbsp;She can climb quickly, do the leap of faith, attack from range with her tools, and she has a wrist blade so she can assassinate properly as well, whereas Yasuke can only do “his own type of assassination” which usually involves a beheading and lots of noise. More importantly, Naoe can handle herself in a fight far better than Yasuke can handle stealth. It still won’t be easy when you’re fighting off half a castle as her, but at least she can drop a smoke bomb and run away to hide again.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</h2>
<p>The game is clearly designed to necessitate the use of both characters, as Naoe and Yasuke both have important roles through the game’s story, but if you have a favourite, then you can largely stick to playing as just one or the other.</p>
<p>You can switch at any time when in the open world, and major story missions are broken up with decision points to let you choose which character to play as for the next section, so you can simply pick to play as your favourite of the two at those points. The one sticking point is when you need to talk to specific NPCs as a particular character, forcing you to switch for at least a short time.</p>

                        <p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Naoe is one of the greatest lead characters we’ve had in a very long time, and she’s the perfect protagonist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-play-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, there is a dual-protagonist system similar to the one found in 2016’s Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate. It’s just as fluid, and you can switch between characters at the press of a button. However, the hulking samurai figure of Yasuke isn’t immediately available, but this guide will answer when you play as him in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when and how to unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but be prepared to put in the work.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-do-you-unlock-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">When Do You Unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>In the opening of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you get to control Yasuke for just a few minutes – but that’s enough to see what he can do. Naturally, you’d want to return to the role of the masterful warrior as soon as possible, but that’s not how this game works.</p>



<p>You’ll need to play as Naoe for several hours before you can unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows – around 8 to 10 hours into the game. That’s how long it took me to get to a point where I could play as Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and that was by following the campaign and ticking off a few side quests along the way.</p>



<p>There’s a key turning point in the story – which I won’t reveal – that makes Yasuke available for open-world play. Once you’ve unlocked him, he remains around permanently, and you’ll be able to switch between him and Naoe relatively easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-yasuke-an-assassin">Is Yasuke an Assassin?</h2>



<p>It’s obvious right off the bat that Yasuke isn’t a traditional assassin. This isn’t a spoiler, as this has been revealed in the run-up to the game’s release, but Yasuke is a samurai warrior with ties to Oda Nobunaga. Naoe is the ‘shinobi’ character with ties to the assassins as we know them, but Yasuke doesn’t fit that bill at all.</p>



<p>He’s clumsy when it comes to parkour, and he doesn’t have eagle vision or a hidden blade, so he’s not a typical assassin.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-rtx-remix-developers-respond-to-concern-from-some-fans-that-it-ruins-the-original-games-atmosphere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotly anticipated <a href="https://za.ign.com/half-life-2-rtx-an-rtx-remix-project" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> launches its demo today, March 18, and IGN sat down with its developers to discuss how they reimagined Valve’s 20-year-old masterpiece using Nvidia's RTX Remix tech, and debate the concern from some fans that it negatively impacts the original’s atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The modding team Orbifold Studios used RTX Remix to modernize Half-Life 2, adding full ray tracing, remastered assets, and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. It is free DLC for Half-Life 2 owners, and its demo is out now on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not everyone in the Half-Life community believes RTX Remix actually improves upon Half-Life 2. Various complaints based on early gameplay footage revolve around RTX Remix’s new lighting, which some have said “strips away” the original’s atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic Ravenholm area is dimly lit in the original, but some fans say RTX Remix makes Ravenholm too brightly lit, reducing the effect of its horror ambience. “Ravenholm has gone from ‘moody’ to ‘obvious tech demo’,” one commenter said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feeling is the pursuit of realism with RTX Remix pulls away from Valve’s original art direction, that artistic choices made by Valve over 20 years ago are negated by RTX Remix’s impact on lighting. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a point IGN put to David Driver-Gomm, co-lead of Half-Life 2 RTX Remix at Orbifold Studios, in our interview, the video version of which is above. In his response, Driver-Gomm said the modders were absorbing the feedback now, and insisted Half-Life 2 RTX was not a finished product by any means, so could be tweaked in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you have different tools, you make different decisions and you make some that are born of necessity and you make some that are born of art, and we have to try and unpick why they did what they did,” Driver-Gomm explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did they do this because it was intentional or did they do this because there was a limit, right? That was done because that was what the engine at the time allowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then when we come and we remake the zombie to a modern fidelity, we use modern technologies like ‘hair cards’ in order to achieve an end result that we hope would kind of be in the artist's mind's eye at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are going to be a wide variety of opinions. There's going to be a lot of people who feel like something would be done differently, and a lot of that feedback is stuff that we are taking on board and working with organically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to a certain extent, some of it is just, we all love this game, so we all have very different opinions on how it should be treated and how the art should come across.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driver-Gomm then said that Orbifold Studios’ mod is its interpretation of Half-Life 2, and any mod team is free to have a go at making an alternative using the RTX Remix technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s moddable,” Driver-Gomm began. “Remix is out there, Half-Life 2 works with it because we're doing it. There is always room for people to put in their own interpretations, and I feel like that is the healthiest way to approach it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Half-Life 2 RTX is an interpretation, right? We're pretty proud of it. We think we're doing a lot of research to get it pretty on point. If people disagree, which is entirely their right to do so, then they have the tools to go and make that alternative interpretation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lighting isn’t the only complaint from some Half-Life 2 fans. Others have pointed to perhaps over-eager clouds of smoke emerging from fire and explosions may obscure the player’s vision. At one point in IGN’s demo gameplay, below, at 3:50 mark, Father Grigori’s shotgun blast and reveal is obscured by smoke, potentially causing the player to miss a key story moment in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Driver-Gomm said the team is already looking into the smoke issue, and explained their process there: “We have Source particle experts on the team and you can see the result of that with things like our new fires and our new explosions. In places where we haven't yet been able to author something different, we've been working with the base game materials and that's kind of how we've ended up where we are with that smoke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Again, it's an evolving process. Mods are not a thing that's like one and done and that's it, it's finished, right? That's never been mods. It's never going to be mods. It's always living and breathing. It's always responding to feedback. It's always deciding, does this person have a point or do I feel that my vision is worth pursuing, and hopefully the results will win out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a complicated thing. We know we're doing something that a lot of people feel very strongly about here with remastering Half-Life 2, and key moments like that are things we are actively working on to make sure match up with the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But this is a demo. This is not the full final game. This is not us saying that this is it always and forever. The point of this demo is to go, we've done a pretty strong foundation here. We've covered a huge amount of assets, we've covered a huge amount of the environment. We want to see what the people think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demo for Half-Life 2 RTX Remix now released, thoughts inevitably turn to whether Orbifold Studios will take on Episode 1 and 2 next. Driver-Gomm kept his cards close to his chest, but did say if his team doesn’t continue on, another could.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Episode 1 and 2 have a lot of assets which are shared with Half-Life 2, right?” he said. “Once we finish Half-Life 2, those will already be done by 70% for Episode 1 and about 50% for Episode 2. We'll have to see when we get there, but there's absolutely nothing stopping a community effort, even if we don't, from just picking up where we left off and wrapping up the work to be done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a year-and-a-half old now, and we're still happily muddling through our second, third, seventh, 10th playthroughs. But with developer Larian choosing to step away from the series, that leaves Hasbro to sort out what it's going to do with Baldur's Gate in the future. Fortunately, it sounds like it won't be too long until we hear at least <em>something</em> about what's going on for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference this week, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">with Larian moving on</a>, Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub also acknowledged that the pressure to get the next Baldur's Gate right is immense, and even bleeds over into other Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related, non-Baldur's Gate projects, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-dungeons-dragons-video-game-in-production-at-hasbro">the game Hasbro announced last year</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm never one to shy down from a challenge," he said. "And I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke with Ayoub on a number of other topics, including Magic: The Gathering, its partnership with Saber Interactive, and Hasbro's overall game strategy. Keep an eye out for our full interview sometime next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

			<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been a long time coming. Despite the clamouring of their fan base, Ubisoft held off for years on giving the people what they want, an Assassin’s Creed game set in feudal Japan. Then, after finally announcing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the game was delayed at the last minute… and then delayed again. Thankfully the wait is over, the latest entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise is finally here, and it is utterly resolutely brilliant. Indeed, it might just be the best game in the storied series to date and Ubisoft’s best game in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Launch Cinematic TV Ad" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxtJFdnMo7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, how do you like your Assassin’s Creed? If you prefer the stealth-focused and closed environment approach of the early games in the franchise, then Shadows is likely not for you. If, on the other hand, your preference is the open-word action RPG approach established by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review/">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a>, then you’ll find that Shadows is the epic culmination of everything you enjoyed since Bayek’s Ancient Egyptian adventure. Though, after the first eight hours or so of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this wasn’t the case.</p>


<p>Shadows is a slow starter, and while the drawn-out opening is full of great emotional beats and outstanding character performances, setting-up protagonist Naoe’s quest for vengeance, it is distinctly lacking in open-world activities and gameplay variety. When you’re not watching its admittedly very beautiful cut scenes, you’ll spend your time travelling from village to village murdering people, with a distinctive lack of tools and abilities to make it interesting to do so. During this opening section of the game, the limited areas of Japan you visit feel sparse, empty, as if something is missing. That something is Yasuke, and by the time the African Samurai strides into the game everything clicks, the open world reveals itself, activities and encounters fill the environment, the gameplay evolves, and finally Assassin’s Creed Shadows kicks into gear.</p>


<p>Yasuke plays in a completely different way to any protagonist in Assassin’s Creed history. He’s an unstoppable tank, like Batman from the Arkham series, as if the Doom Slayer was lifted from Hell and plonked into feudal Japan. Clad in robust armour, Yasuke shrugs off most attacks, smashing through opponent’s defences to complete a strike, even if it means taking some damage on the way. Later, Yasuke’s extensive skill tree can be harnessed to allow him to reclaim health from attacking, but in the early going you’ll be too busy grinning with glee as the mighty samurai boots an unwitting thug, sending them careening with rag-doll hilarity through the wall of a nearby temple. Combat is punchy and reliably structured around parries and dodges to expose an enemy to counter attack. Nothing groundbreaking here, but eminently satisfying, and I found myself playing as Yasuke far more than I thought I would, just to throw it down with another Daimyo or two.</p>
<p>Of course, many will lean towards playing as Naoe first and foremost, as she fulfils that more traditional role of the Assassin’s Creed avatar with stealth and athleticism. That means all your expected tropes, with free running, flipping, and leap of faith-falling aplenty. The extra time in development has clearly served Shadows well, as, for once, the free-running works perfectly. No more accidentally leaping off cliffs, Naoe goes where you want her to go, when you want her to go there, with smooth and precise animation. That’s not to say that this Shinobi doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Crawling through low cover is now an option, as is swinging on a grappling hook, allowing for different approaches on a target to be carried out – Yasuke simply can’t access rooftops and vantage points in the same way. More intriguing is that Shadows is the first Assassin’s Creed where light and dark in the environment influences your likelihood to be seen. It now makes complete strategic sense to wait until dark before infiltrating a fortress, snuffing out candles as you making your way past hordes of enemies, practically invisible. To reach your victim unseen is a satisfying thrill, one that is sure to scratch the itch of even the most ardent stealth enthusiast.</p>

<p>Each player character has an enormous amount of differing abilities, weapons, and tools to mess around with. Yasuke’s shotgun-like Teppo is tremendous fun, thanks to the ability to switch weapons mid-attack meaning you can parry attacks from a sword, before spinning the rifle into position and blowing a foes’ face off Meanwhile Naoe’s standout weapon, the dagger-like Tanto, is far more exciting than it sounds, thanks to they way in which the Ninja slams it into to her victim with wanton abandon. Actually, this must be the goriest Assassin’s Creed yet – watching Yasuke slice off both his opponents arms before hacking off their head is quite the sight.</p>
<p>What really makes Assassin’s Creed Shadows tick though, is the option to freely switch between the leads depending on the situation you face and how you want to deal with it. A veritable army of Samurai blocking your way? Yasuke will carve a bloody path through them, but, if you’re not feeling the need for a fight, you can switch to Naoe and creep past them instead. It’s a shame that whilst the game encourages experimentation with its two player characters, offering open combat encounters to play around in, it makes it so darn clunky to swap between them, forcing you to dip into the menus to do so. This is particularly aggravating when you encounter a quest-giver for a specific hero, demanding you switch hero before you can interact with them. This is something they can hopefully refine in an early patch.</p>
<p>It’s in the depiction of feudal Japan that Assassin’s Creed Shadows truly delivers. Frankly, there are moments of jaw-dropping visual beauty here. You can spend ages just soaking in the vistas that stretch many miles into the distance. Blossom trees blow hither and thither in the wind, each branch moving independently of the others as blossoms float down to coat a woodland path. Seasons change and the environments with it, submerging villages in snow, or causing flowers to bloom in the summer. Waves lap against the shore, the sunlight sparkling across the water. Stunning is a word that doesn’t quite do justice to the environmental detail on display here, but it’ll do.</p>

<p>Unusually for Ubisoft, this glorious open world isn’t covered in icons and intrusive HUD nonsense. While you can still scan the surroundings from high-up vantage points, this doesn’t automatically fill your map with navigation points, instead insisting that you mark points of interest for yourself, and only a handful at a time. It’s less immediate, but it means you’re encouraged to explore the world more dynamically, search for your next target, find yourself distracted by an intriguing cave that you decide to explore, discovering an awesome new weapon hidden deep within.</p>
<p>Events occur organically around you, often dictated by the season. A peasant might need rescuing from some thugs, a passing Ronin might challenge you to a duel, or you might spot a lovely dog to pet and bring home to your hideout. There’s a wide range of activities to undertake, delightfully many of them avoiding combat to bring different experiences to the player. A forgotten crumbling temple becoming a free-running playground, a meditation point that brings transport your character into past events, taking the time to paint a playing bunny, clambering to the summit of a big waterfall to try and see if Yasuke can do a leap of faith – you’re definitely going to want to try it. In short, the world of Assassin’s Creed Shadows feel alive, with a historical and cultural authenticity that blew my mind.</p>

<p>The historical plot is smart and well-researched, brilliant evoking a Japanese Samurai cinema vibe with Assassin’s Creed’s own distinctive style. During your adventure, you’ll meet a who’s who of important figures from the period in their adventures, Oda Nobunaga and Hattori Hanzo are two early stand outs, but there are many more infamous characters expertly woven into proceedings. Thankfully, there’s also a minimum of modern-world nonsense here, with the option to explore digital anomalies and AI shenanigans if you want, but mostly letting you stick with the awesome feudal Japan setting. With all that going for the storyline, even a few blatantly obvious plot twists doesn’t change the fact that this is my favourite Assassin’s Creed setting and storyline by far.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Assassin's Creed series</a> may no longer have the luster it had with the games starring Ezio Auditore, but there's no denying that there's still no video game series like it. While the stories featured in many installments may not be one hundred percent accurate to the time period they are set in, the ability to explore some of the world's most incredible places while getting to interact with real historical figures is something that very few games can offer at this quality level. With the introduction of role-playing game mechanics, some of the uniqueness of the series was inevitably lost, but the market seemed to appreciate this direction, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, even with its issues, achieved financial success, selling the highest number of copies during its launch weekend for the series.</p>
<p>Following the return to the series' roots with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the franchise doubles down on the open-world RPG formula this year with Assassin's Creed Shadows. While an entry in the series set in Feudal Japan was something that fans have been asking for for a very long time, the game has been very controversial since its reveal due to the choice of protagonists, mainly Yasuke, the first known African man in Japan who served Oda Nobunaga whose status as a proper samurai is still debated to this day, and other cultural mishaps, which include using a stolen flag design in concept art and a collectible statue of the game featuring a damaged torii gate resembling the ruined gate of Sannō Shrine in Nagasaki linked to the tragic 1945 atomic bombing.</p>
<p>While some of the complaints that have been raised are justified, I feel it would be a shame if the discourse surrounding the game were only limited to them, as I have found Assassin's Creed Shadows to be a solid game that improves on the series' RPG formula in a lot of ways and that takes full advantage of its incredible technical achievements to improve its open-world gameplay to make the experience more about exploring and living the world, rather than going from one map marker to the next.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250307184718_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set in late 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the final phase of the Sengoku period marked by social upheavals and the unification of Japan under powerful warlords, which culminated with the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate by Ieyasu Tokugawa. The turbulent political situation of the period serves as the backdrop of Naoe's story, a female shinobi from Iga whose father has been killed by the Shinbakufu, a group of powerful individuals that move in the shadows to take advantage of the chaos enveloping Japan to further their own unclear ends.</p>
<p>Set on avenging her father and recovering a mysterious box Naoe's father told her to protect at all costs, the young shinobi embarks on a journey of vengeance that will get her to meet and act together with some of the most powerful men of Japan, and their servants, including the African warrior Yasuke, who will join Naoe in her quest for vengeance for his own personal reasons, which tie into the Brotherhood and Templar Order story previously seen in the franchise. The two will be joined during the course of the adventure by other individuals who will get to be part of the League Naoe has to put together to take on the powerful Shinbakufu.</p>
<p>While the premise is relatively straightforward, the story of Assassin's Creed Shadows is enjoyable, with some surprising twists related to the Shinbakufu that keep the player hungering for more until the mostly satisfying ending. Unlike Assassin's Creed Valhalla, whose story really started dragging on a dozen hours in, Shadows' story is much better paced and, clocking at around 40 hours, doesn't overstay its welcome, although some fatigue will inevitably start to creep in after 20 or so hours as some scenarios and individual storylines start to feel kind of repetitive. Still, there are definitely some remarkable moments in the adventure that make it worth experiencing, especially for history buffs who love the Sengoku period, as every major player of the late 16th century is present in some capacity.</p>
<p>Being the main characters, Naoe and Yasuke obviously get the most development, which is delivered in a series of quests that delve deeper into their pasts and how they got to the fateful day when the armies of Oda Nobunaga attacked Iga. Further development is offered during main and side quests, which delve deeper into their bond as well as into both their new and already established relationships. Those who like one of the two characters more than the other also have the choice of initiating quests with their character of choice, although there are times when both will be present or when either one of the two protagonists is required to proceed. Many other characters appear as the story dictates, but they receive limited development, which is not surprising considering their brief screen time, although the allies that get to be part of the League have a slightly bigger role than the characters who appear in the regional main quests, and thus stay a little longer in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Like in the prior games since the RPG shift, Assassin's Creed Shadows also allows players to make choices during pivotal moments that can heavily influence a character's relationships and how the story moves forward. Those who want to have a more traditional Assassin's Creed experience, however, can play the game in Canon Mode, which makes the story proceed as the developers intended. This is definitely a nice option to have and one of the many included in the game that further bridges the gap between the action RPG entries in the series and the classic formula that powered the first few entries in the franchise.</p>
<p>One thing that modern Assassin's Creed doesn't seem capable of bringing back properly is the modern-day story, and, as such, it is not surprising that Assassin's Creed Shadows fails in this area as well. The game serves as a starting point for a new modern story, but given how little importance it has in the game, it's clear that the developer focused more on getting their historical fiction set in the late Sengoku period right. For some people, they will have failed, as the two protagonists will continue to be controversial choices, especially Yasuke, who did appear already in other video games set in the late Sengoku period but never as a proper samurai, and details here and there remain inaccurate, but generally, Ubisoft, at the very least, attempted to address some of the controversies, such making it impossible to climb on torii gates, although this is only one of the many issues in the setting.</p>
<p>Would a traditional Japanese samurai have made for a better protagonist? Perhaps, but that would have required telling a different story. A key part of what makes Yasuke's story interesting is how he fits into a society so unlike the one he was born into, and his ambiguous historical role gave the developers more creative freedom to fill in the gaps. At the same time, the Assassin's Creed series has always taken liberties with real history, which led to plenty of inaccuracies, like the Icelandic Vegvisir magical stave appearing prominently in Valhalla when there is no known historical evidence that it was used during the Viking Age, so Shadows really isn't doing anything different in this regard.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311183830_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with its story, Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't exactly push the boundaries of the third-person action RPG formula established by its predecessors but introduces some choice improvements that really enhance the experience. While the player will still need to explore a huge map roughly the size of the map in Assassin's Creed Origins, heading towards certain locations to initiate and complete quests, how the player goes on to do this has been slightly changed. To start and continue a good portion of the game's quests, players first need to find where exactly to go, as the game doesn't provide a precise location from the get-go but only a few pointers, leaving players on their own to find out where they have to go.</p>
<p>The scout system can also be used to search an area on the map, but scouts have limited uses each season and can only be replenished by spending money, so searching on your own will be the way to go most of the time. And the most fun, to be honest, as it makes the experience more immersive than before, requiring players to look at the map and engage in a bit more organic exploration in the vein of<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/breath-of-the-wild-greatest-legend/"> Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">sequel</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a>, to name a few open-world games that mostly avoided the excessive use of map markers. Similarly, some of the game's side activities, such as those that involve hunting down the members of certain groups, also require the player to put in some work to find their locations, which makes these side activities more engaging than most of the others in the game. Those who prefer playing Shadows as if it were any previous entry in the series can just skip all of the above and turn on Guided Exploration Mode.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no way to completely turn off the map indicators, so you will still know beforehand the general location of points of interest, which include towns, enemy strongholds like castles, temples, individual challenges for Naoe and Yasuke, painting spots, and more. The vast majority of these locations are entirely optional to explore, but Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an incentive to do so by tying character progression with the Knowledge System. To learn additional skills on the twelve skill trees, six for each character, the player needs not only Mastery Points, obtained by leveling up and completing certain side activities, but also Knowledge Points, which unlock a new portion of the skill trees once certain point thresholds have been reached. Focusing on exploring the locations that are encountered while going for the main story objectives provides a decent amount of Knowledge Points, so there's thankfully no need to go out of one's way to explore every inch of the map to unlock fundamental skills for both main characters.</p>
<p>When it comes to variety, Assassin's Creed Shadows provides some in the moment-to-moment gameplay with a solid main quest design centered around the two protagonists and the open-world design technical advancements. After a certain point in the story, which coincides with a well-known moment in Feudal Japan history which takes place at Honnoji Temple, the player can switch at will between Naoe and Yasuke and becomes able to approach quests in two very different ways. As a shinobi, Naoe is extremely agile and comes with advanced parkour capabilities, which include a handy grappling hook that makes it very easy for her to stay concealed and eliminate targets with a bit of finesse. Yasuke, on the other hand, fully embodies the combat-oriented approach seen in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, coming with very average parkour abilities but a wealth of combat options that allow him to take on multiple enemies at the same time with ease, something Naoe sometimes struggles with due to her weapon options and skills. As such, every quest has been designed so that it can be completed with any playstyle, providing an unprecedented level of flexibility for an Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>Empowering the two different playstyles available in Assassin's Creed Shadows are some noticeable improvements for both stealth and combat mechanics. The former, in particular, has benefitted the most from the incredibly dynamic world Ubisoft created for the game, where sudden weather condition changes aren't just aesthetic but impact gameplay considerably. For starters, enemy visibility is heavily impacted by the time of day but also by certain weather conditions, so infiltrating a stronghold at night with a heavy rain downpour can prove to be beneficial for Naoe, who can use Eagle Vision to pinpoint enemy locations and mark them on the HUD with the Observe mechanics, no matter the visibility.</p>
<p>The lighting of any given area can also have a tremendous impact on stealth, so turning lamps and lanterns off can be incredibly beneficial and prevent enemies from being alerted by your character's shadow. All of these elements are further influenced by the current season, which can provide certain advantages or disadvantages, such as vegetation providing more cover, more frequent weather conditions changes, and so on. The enemy AI has been slightly improved as well, as they react to sound, which includes footsteps on nightingale panels, and group up when investigating anything that caught their attention. At Expert difficulty, enemies are even more observant, and even roofs become unsafe, requiring players to really be careful navigating enemy territory as any slip-up will result in getting discovered and potentially overpowered. The best thing about all of these features is how they dynamically interact with one another, forcing players to adapt to any given situation, elevating the typical Assassin's Creed experience in some surprisingly good ways, and making the Shadows' stealth mechanics some of the best in the entire series.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250309175824_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The combat improvements are slightly less substantial than those made to stealth, but they are still quite noticeable, building upon the existing foundation to deliver something a little bit more involved. Both protagonists can unleash light and heavy combo strings, powerful Posture attacks, and special skills that require Adrenaline, block, dodge, and parry enemy attacks, but it's how they accomplish all of the above that differs. While competent, Naoe is not that great at fighting enemies head-on, thus her weapon of choices, which include Katana, Nanto and Kusarigama, don't deal the same amount of damage Yasuke's powerful long Katana, Naginata spear and Kanabo war club.</p>
<p>Her superior agility, however, makes her better at dodging enemy attacks, whereas Yasuke's heavier fighting style allows him to take a few hits, though he is still capable of sidestepping and backstepping to avoid attacks. By unlocking skills on the 12 skill trees and completing companions quests, it is possible to learn additional combat abilities for all available weapons, which include different combo strings, timed button presses for increased power and some passives, and become able to call in allies to fight alongside Naoe and Yasuke and even assist them when they are undetected, which, together with the many types of gear available coming, in their Legendary highest level of rarity, with some rather useful perks, expand combat options and make the experience quite varied. Some of the skills also allow both characters to use the environment to their advantage, adding more depth to the experience.</p>
<p>All of this wouldn't matter much if we were in the same button-mashing territory of some of the previous entries in the series, but this isn't the case in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Button mashing here leads only to dragged-out fights and higher chances of defeat, as enemies not only tend to block a lot, forcing players to use the slower Posture attacks to break their guard, but they also parry and counter reckless attacks. To get an opening, the player needs to pay attention to how they attack, deflecting or blocking their regular white and blue-coded attacks, and dodge the red-coded unblockable attacks. When defending properly with the correct timing, enemies become Vulnerable, allowing the player to deal increased damage. With enemies often ganging up on the player and even canceling their attack animations with sudden guards, the combat experience in Assassin's Creed Shadows can get rather intense, which is something I wasn't expecting. The excellent animation work in combat and some brutal finishers from Yasuke also contribute to making fighting enemies head-on as satisfying as assassinating them from the shadows.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311195407_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another major part of the Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay is the Hideout mechanics. A few hours into the game, Naoe will get the chance to start building a haven for her allies to help her, and later Yasuke, in her war against the Shinbakufu, adding a variety of facilities that offer different services like a forge to improve equipment, a dojo to train allies, a Kakurega to improve safehouse management, and more, and introduce some beneficial effects like increased experience points and the like. By improving the Hideout, it will also level up and introduce some other beneficial effects that can be more or less useful. Those who want to combine looks with functionality can also freely arrange the buildings any way they see fit, decorate them with all sorts of items, connect them using some of the Engawa roofed corridors available, and so on. To do all this, however, players will need to use a lot of resources besides mon. These are mostly found by completing side content, such as the seasonal regional contracts, which often involve stealing resources or killing all enemies from enemy camps that are randomly generated on the map, bloating the already inflated wealth of side content even more.</p>
<p>While the typical open-world bloat has indeed been reduced over past entries, Assassin's Creed Shadows still features way too many side activities clearly designed to extend the playtime and get players to spend money on cosmetics and additional gear that add little to the experience. At the start of my playthrough, I tried to explore a bit more and see what was hidden below all those question mark indicators on the map, but I quickly changed my mind when all I found were similar enemy camps that provided small rewards that, ultimately, have little positive impact on the experience. My time with the game got way more enjoyable when I started doing things a little more organically, exploring whenever I felt like it when going from one main story quest to another, engaging with the additional system only when truly required, or halting my travels whenever I saw some villager in need of help, or a Shinbakufu ronin ready to fight.</p>
<p>This also made me appreciate more how dynamic and living the world is, as there are a lot of little details scattered around that enhance immersion, such as groups of women grieving their dead, people talking about their lives, and so on. Ultimately, the additional content is there for those who really want to fully complete the game, but I feel the vast majority of players would get bored of the game pretty quickly if they were to go after absolutely everything they see on the map, as the rewards aren't really worth the effort. Unfortunately, there are times when completing side content is essentially required to level up so as to be able to take on story quests, so avoiding side content almost completely is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>The release of Assassin's Creed Shadows also marks the launch of the Animus Hub, the project previously known as Assassin's Creed Infinity, which will act as the immersive point of entry for the entire series, allowing players to quickly access any of the previous games they have purchased, access regularly released missions to obtain Keys that can be exchanged for rewards and more. The rewards offered for the current projects are decent enough, so these additional missions are definitely worth pursuing for those who are wholly invested in the game's many mechanics and systems. Those who feel the game is already bloated enough, even without the Animus Hub Projects, will end up ignoring them to keep the experience slimmer and more focused on story-related content.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313193816_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before the game's launch a few months back, Ubisoft stated that Assassin's Creed Shadows would be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, and after having seen a good portion of what the map has to offer, I can say that is not only the most visually advanced entries but also one of the most visually advanced open-world games to date. Besides being extremely polished with little to no visual glitches, this rendition of Feudal Japan looks outright stunning, thanks to the great usage of ray-traced global illumination. With the Diffuse Everywhere option, and high ray tracing quality, the game's atmosphere is unparalleled at all times of day and weather conditions, making it a joy to traverse the game world bordered by dense vegetation, get up high on viewpoints, and see some of the most amazing vistas seen in open-world games to date. Ray-traced global illumination, lighting, and the density of the game world are only some of the remarkable visual features of the game, as particle effects are just as impressive as RTGI.</p>
<p>Whether it's leaves blown in the wind, pouring rain, or snowflakes, these effects do a great job highlighting the great attention to detail that has been poured into the game, which, at times, rivals that seen in Red Dead Redemption 2. The tech used for rendering hair is also one of the highlights and something that very few games have got as right as Ubisoft has in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Unfortunately, there are some stiff animations here and there that really feel out of place in such a beautifully rendered world, as do some mediocre facial animations, but thankfully, the vast majority of them are fine. Some are more than fine, such as combat animations, which feel incredibly smooth and well deliver not only the extreme agility and the extreme strength of the two main characters, but also their lack of. Yasuke's heavy parkour animations and clumsy leap-of-faith animations are great examples of this.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows PC 4K@60 Gameplay DLSS Quality, Frame Generation, Ray Tracing High" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkqOwIONdxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Experiencing Assassin's Creed Shadows at its best, however, has a cost, and only the most powerful system configurations are able to run the game at maximum settings, full ray tracing, and native 4K resolution at 60 FPS. Thankfully, the game scales really well across different system configurations, sporting a great variety of visual settings to tweak with a handy preview that highlights how each setting affects the visuals. At 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, and the settings in the screenshots below, the game ran extremely well on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) with no visible stuttering, often hitting the 120 FPS mark, except for cutscenes, which are sadly locked at 30 FPS to retain a cinematic feel. The in-game benchmark also returned excellent results with unlocked framerate, hitting an average of 117 FPS, 99 1% low, and 93 0.1% low. Seeing the essentially bugless high level of technical polish on display here, there's little doubt that delaying the game multiple times was definitely the right choice, one that more publishers should consider to deliver solid PC ports.</p>

<p>While the Assassin's Creed Shadows visuals do their best to make players feel immersed in this amazing rendition of Feudal Japan, the same cannot be said for the game's audio features as a whole. The game's soundtrack is mostly fine, alternating between some rock-oriented and traditional-sounding pieces as the situation requires, but the English voice acting is most definitely not. Accents are all over the place, and the insertion of Japanese words into the English script sounds really forced at times, ruining immersion. Thankfully, the game offers an Immersive Mode where characters speak in their native tongues, Japanese and Portuguese, for the most part, where voice acting is of really high quality. Needless to say, Immersive Mode is the one to pick for the best experience.</p>
<p>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kill-team-blood-and-zeal-expansion-brings-ferocity-and-faith-to-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. The aptly named <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>, will not just introduce new factions to the skirmish game, but the introduction of two new mission decks.</p>

<h2>The <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qtq917vz/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-how-the-latest-expansion-set-changes-the-game/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop goes into detail about the <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> expansion. First, the expansion will introduce new units to the game: Khorne's bloodthirsty Goremongers and the militant Sanctifiers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-card-artwork.jpg?itok=CTR09X2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-card-artwork.jpg?itok=0r-bG8NT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But the big draw in this set is an exclusive set of 32 cards. Those cards are divided into two new mission categories: Blood and Zeal. Zeal mission cards represent protection and guidance, reducing wounds or preventing death. Alternatively, Blood cards are aggressive, providing bonus damage, extra movement, and even double Fight and Shoot actions.</p>

<p>Players can draw and play from either of these decks during the Strategy phase and whenever an opponent scores Victory Points. In addition, these cards can be used with any faction in the game. In addition, you can score additional Victory Points if you played the most Blood or Zeal cards during a match. This means no matter what you play, you have some extra options at your disposal.</p>

<p>These cards play into another new feature in <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. There is a shrine statue in the set; a focal point of supernatural power. While controlling the statue, your operatives can perform two new actions. Praise/Blaspheme lets you remove cards from your hand or discard pile and draw a new one. Hallow/Defile, allows you to draw a new card into your hand.</p>

<p>This means controlling the shrine statue can grant players a major advantage. It can lead to valiant standoffs or devastating slaughter depending on how the dice go.</p>

<p>These new mission decks will not stop with <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. The post continues stating each new Kill Team battle box will contain new mission packs. It mentions an upcoming box, Kill team: Brutal and Cunning, which will facilitate attacker/defender scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> has a new patch that makes a raft of changes to the Paradox city builder's UI and systems such as traffic and garbage, while adding two new Easy and Normal difficulty modes and ten 'birthday parks' to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-celebrate-10-years-of-cities-skylines-with-a-roadmap-of-anniversary-goodies">celebrate the first game's 10 year anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The developers have also made some "quality-of-life improvements related to homelessness". That's "quality-of-life" in the vacuum-sealed software development sense of the simulation being nicer to operate, rather than quality of life in the sense of having a roof over your head. I would probably have gone with some slightly less dystopian phrasing, Colossal Order.</p><!--more-->
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 patch 1.2.5f1 adds a homelessness stat to the population info view, and makes homeless 'households' visible and selectable in park Selected Info Panels. "These changes make it easier to track homelessness, find homeless populations in your city, and check the situation for individual homeless citizens," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/604150552688854681?l=english">changelog</a> explains.</p>
<p>They've also tinkered with the game's systems to reduce homelessness in general. As of this new patch, "if the homeless in your city are generally employed, they simply need affordable housing," the changelog continues. "If they are also unemployed, they will need jobs suitable for their education level before they can leave the homeless status behind."</p>
<p>Colossal Order have also changed the logic for newly adult citizens leaving their childhood homes. Rather than leaving as soon as they reached adulthood, and becoming homeless if there were no affordable new homes to be had, they'll stay until certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Firstly, they'll need a job before moving out. Secondly, households will provide kids flying the roost with some starting funds for a new house: if there isn't enough cash to spare, the younger generation will stick around and contribute their incomes to the household. Thirdly, they'll now check for available homes before moving out. If there aren't any to be had, they'll leave the city and become commuters. That's to say, their housing needs will become another city's problem.</p>
<p>Going by the most recent Steam reviews, the big story with Skylines 2 is still the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">technical state at launch</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">shortage of features</a> versus its much-updated predecessor, but there have also been some headline-worthy twiddles for the economic and social systems. Last June, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-achieves-ultimate-catharsis-by-deleting-landlords-to-fix-spiralling-rent-prices-in-its-next-patch">solved the problem of soaring rents by deleting landlords</a>, a crowd-pleasing "quality-of-life" adjustment if ever there was one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems like no matter where you go, Mappa is right there, ready and waiting with an anime something-or-other you weren't expecting. This time, you'll find the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, of all places, specifically in its first expansion pack Lost Colony. Studio Wildcard revealed a teaser of the expansion yesterday, set to be released November this year, showing off one of "numerous" anime cutscenes that it will feature focusing on the character Mei Yin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If you couldn't recognise her voice from all the grunting she does in the trailer, Michelle Yeoh is reprising her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated series, and she'll be joined by Madeleine Madden as Helena Walker from the show too. The expansion will also include Moana's Auli'i Cravalho as Meeka, that little kid hanging out with Vin Diesel in Ark 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-stars-vin-diesel">reveal trailer</a>. And yes, Wildcard wants you to know that her presence alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a>, Genesis, and Lost Colony "leads into the events" of the sequel. Wildcard has been pretty quiet on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> since its announcement in 2020 outside of a few delays, so this at least marks some sign of life.

Lost Colony will feature the kind of additions many expansions do like new abilities, gear, building systems, things like that. Story wise you're being hunted by, uh, demons, it seems, which there appeared to be a taste of in the teaser above, in a "vast occupied city" called Arat Prime, the "birthplace of the Arks."
</p>
<p>
Ark 2 itself has been delayed numerous times, and was technically meant to come out last year, but considering Wildcard released a <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/community-crunch-440-ark-survival-ascended-content-roadmap-r2429/">content roadmap</a> earlier this year that featured plans for Survival Ascended all the way up to December 2026, and nothing for its sequel, you're probably safe to place a bet on it taking a while longer.
