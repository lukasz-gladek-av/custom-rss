            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/sony-makes-psn-optional-on-pc-games-with-new-incentives-for-signing-in-spider-man-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has reversed course on one of their most unpopular policies, making having a PlayStation Network account optional on PC. Instead of requiring a PSN log in they will offer incentives for signing up or logging into an existing account.</p>
<p>The change has been made just in time for tomorrow’s release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/spider-man-2-swings-onto-pc-in-january-2025/">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC</a>, and will apply for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered when that releases in April. It is also being rolled back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC</a>, with in-game content unlocks being added soon.</p>


<p>For the rest of the PlayStation Studios library on PC, games with online multiplayer modes will still require PSN – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has online co-op, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-is-coming-to-pc-in-may/">Ghost of Tsushima’s Legends mode</a> will still need PSN, but it is not needed for the single player. The exception to that is that the backlash to adding the requirement to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was so severe that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">Sony backed down before implementing it</a>.</p>
<p>There’s another exception with the completely single-player Until Dawn remake. Hopefully that will be amended soon to have a more clear-cut policy.</p>
<p>Prior to making PSN mandatory last year, Sony had been giving bonus unlocks and content to those logging in – bonus costumes for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/horizon-forbidden-west-pc-specs-confirmed/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, for example – and they’ve basically gone back to that plan.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s coming to the four games mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong> – Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</li>
<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> – Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver&nbsp;and 250 XP)</li>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</strong> – +50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras, Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie</li>
<li><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</strong> – Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-details-emerge-on-upcoming-dungeons-dragons-video-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons game has been unveiled, with Resolution Games showcasing DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. This game has been made in collaboration between Resolution Games and Wizards of the Coast, to bring newcomers and veterans together to enjoy a world that will immerse you in the lore of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Resolution Games' has used its award-winning Demeo Action Roleplaying System to help create this title, to provide players with the atmosphere and intense battle they need to really fit into the world of D&amp;D. Below is the official announce trailer for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cypwLhY8BP4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"By leveraging the power of the Demeo system, Resolution Games is able to take a different approach to Dungeons &amp; Dragons by putting the emphasis on fast turn-based combat and pick-up-and-play mechanics," says Eugene Evans, SVP of Digital Strategy &amp; Licensing at Wizards of the Coast. "BATTLEMARKED continues <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/">Hasbro's strategy</a> to leverage our extensive catalog of world-class IP to create digital games through licensing and internal studio development."</p>
<p>Compared to the typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience, DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: BATTLEMARKED is a DM-less system with a focus on social strategy instead of focusing on social roleplay. Doing this encourages table talk that is focused on tactics and decision-making rather than building a personality for the characters in roleplay situations.</p>
<p>DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: BATTLEMARKED will support cross-platform co-op play of up to four players, with two story-based campaigns when the game launches, with additional campaigns in a variety of D&amp;D settings to be planned as downloadable content in the future.&nbsp; This game will be available on multiple platforms when it's released. For now, you can keep up to date by keeping your eye on <a href="https://battlemarked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a>, where they will release information accordingly.</p>
<p>"With the launch of Demeo back in 2021, we began to grow an incredible relationship with the D&amp;D player community. Demeo and Demeo Battles quickly became a game night substitute for Dungeon Masters who wanted an out-of-campaign way to have fun with their groups and for D&amp;D players to introduce their friends and family to tabletop miniatures games," says Tommy Palm, Founder and CEO of Resolution Games.</p>
<p>Demeo is still incredibly popular and used frequently, and if you haven't already, you can try out <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo</a> and <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeobattles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo Battles</a> on most gaming devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-trailer-drops-for-phantom-line-a-co-op-shooter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new trailer has dropped for Phantom Line, which is set to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-line-is-a-stunning-paranormal-swat-co-op-tactical-fps-by-ex-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-developers/">1-4 player co-op shooter</a> that takes place in a post-nuclear European continent. However, it's not your average shooter, as you will be tasked with searching for anomalies. Anomalies are paranormal activities that are hidden from the public eye. You have to find them while searching an open-world map where many dynamic events will take place to shake up the gameplay.</p>
<p>In this title, you work as an elite spec-op unit for Mortfield Industries. You've been chosen for the Operator Simulation Program called H.U.S.K, where you can take your consciousness and place it into an artificial body. By doing so, you can use the H.U.S.K.s to your advantage, using them to scout the area, distract enemies, be a decoy, and many other tactics that can help you survive while tracing the anomalies.</p>
<p>This is all taking place in a world where Nuclear war has just broken out, and you are sent off to the Iron Corridor, which is an Eastern European area that has been devastated by international tensions. In order to survive, you need to be able to be self-sufficient and improvise when the situation arises. This includes using resources around you, getting better gear, as well as hunting and cooking animals to make sure that you stay healthy on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Below is a trailer for Phantom Line, where you can see all the action unfold. Additionally, if you're interested in playtesting this game, you can do so by joining <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Discord</a>, where you will be able to receive a key and try the game out for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Line - New Playtest Available NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYJk7C22eeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as fighting off enemies and trying to find anomalies, there will also be an Icebreaker ship that will serve as your base. From here, you will be able to customize your H.U.S.K., as well as your cabin, where you can show off all of your weapons and armor to your friends. This will also be the place where you can modify your loadout, including your gear and body.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for Phantom Line, and they are still working on getting the game to run at a stable 30fps at 1080p. You can keep up to date with the team via Discord or the updates they post on Steam by wishlisting the game if this is something you are interested in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Start your engines! The first tentpole release for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/everything-coming-to-magic-gathering-in-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Everything Coming to Magic: The Gathering in 2025"><em>Magic: The Gathering </em>in 2025 </a>is here with <em>Aetherdrift</em><em>, </em>and we're racing to take a look at one of the preconstructed decks. This <em>Living Energy </em>review will examine it and answer what is it, is it worth buying, and if you do buy itm what are some cards you can look to add to it.</p>

<h2>Living Energy Review</h2>

<p><em>Living Energy </em>is the third energy deck set to be released in less than a year, but it is the first of those in Temur (green/blue/red) colors. The deck is also meant to capture some of the mechanical identity of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Aetherdrift Brings Wacky Races and New Name for an Old Plane to Magic: The Gathering">Avishkar (the plane formerly known as Kaladesh</a>) that the main set wasn't able to due to its focus on the race across three planes.</p>

<p><em>Living Energy </em>showcases well known characters of Avishkar like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a>. While there is a primary focus on energy in <em>Living Energy</em> as the name implies there are also subthemes in the deck of artifacts, and thopters that fit that Avishkar mechanical identity role, while synergizing well with the rest of the deck.</p>

<p>As far as play goes, <em>Living Energy </em>plays very ramp heavy. With 15 different pieces of ramp or mana fetch, along with 38 lands and a few ways to cheat out spells, it’s built to ramp to high mana values and take over the game with big spells. It shows in the deck’s aspirational mana curve, and average mana value of 3.64. which is higher than you typically want to see.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/academy-ruins-elder-gargaroth-and-retrofitter-foundry.jpg?itok=kw6z9F9m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/academy-ruins-elder-gargaroth-and-retrofitter-foundry.jpg?itok=OaOCohjQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Valuewise, there are some notable cards included in <em>Living Energy</em>. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/309/academy-ruins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Ruins">Academy Ruins </a>runs for $15-$20 and is the most expensive card in the deck. After that you have <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/111/elder-gargaroth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elder Gargaroth">Elder Gargaroth </a>which is also over $10, while there’s a set of highly playable cards in the $5-$9 range including <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/136/retrofitter-foundry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Retrofitter Foundry">Retrofitter Foundry</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/55/lightning-greaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lightning Greaves">Lightning Greaves</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/135/panharmonicon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Panharmonicon">Panharmonicon</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/143/triplicate-titan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Triplicate Titan">Triplicate Titan</a>. From a <em>Living Energy</em> review perspective, this is good, but not phenomenal value.</p>

<h3>Living Energy Commanders Review</h3>

<p><em>Living Energy</em> comes with two commander options, both of which are among the new cards for the deck. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli, Radiant Creator</a> is the face commander, and is a 4 mana 4/4 with a pair of important abilities. Her first ability is that she gives energy whenever you play an artifict or artificer, similar to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/3/dr-madison-li" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dr Madison Li">Dr. Madison Li </a>from the <em>Fallout</em> <em>Science!</em> deck. Setting her apart though is her second ability, where you spend three energy to make a 5/5 token copy of any permanent you control until end of turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/saheeli-and-pia-nalaar.jpg?itok=DmPMkYrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/saheeli-and-pia-nalaar.jpg?itok=f07_1Ja0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The alternate commander is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic</a>. A 3 mana 2/4, she gets down early, and generates 2 energy whenever artifact creatures deal combat damage to a player, encouraging an artifact creature heavy deck that is more aggressive. Like Saheeli she has a second ability, where at the end of turn you can spend any amount of energy, to make a vehicle token with power and toughness equal to the energy spent, and crew 2</p>

<p>While <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a> has potential in more aggressive decks, she’s much narrower that <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, and <em>Living Energy</em> is built to work with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli </a>in charge. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a> still works as an energy creator and sink in a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli </a>deck, so unlike some commander decks, the two options work together here.</p>

<h2>Cards To Upgrade Your MTG Living Energy Commander Deck</h2>

<p>If you purchase <em>Living Energy</em> it should be playable at casual tables, but there’s definite room for upgrades. Taming the deck’s manacurve, and focusing on making the most out of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a> are our major focuses here..</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/62/the-motherlode-excavator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Motherlode, Excavator"><strong>The Motherlode, Excavator</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-motherlode-excavator.jpg?itok=1Ph-CRDH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-motherlode-excavator.jpg?itok=8Rdq8sTn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the <em>Science!</em> commander deck, The Motherlode is an energy generator, solid sized creature, and has the ability to take care of disruptive non-basic lands. When it does that, it also removes makes that players non-flyers unable to block until end of turn, opening up that opponent for an alpha strike.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/63/displacer-kitten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Displacer Kitten"><strong>Displacer Kitten</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/displacer-kitten.jpg?itok=pWwK0Eu9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/displacer-kitten.jpg?itok=OuFICsEw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Providing some redundancy for our commander, Displacer Kitten takes advantage of all the enters the battlefield effects in the dec by blinking them in and out of existance. The Displacer Kitten can blink any non-land permanent you control, so there’s lot of flexibility in it’s use.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/67/roil-cartographer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Roil Cartographer"><strong>Roil Cartographer</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roil-cartographer.jpg?itok=8ggYPrEr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roil-cartographer.jpg?itok=xdPkPVcr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An odd omission from the deck, Roil Cartographer is from <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> and will join with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/13/nissa-worldsoul-speaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker">Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker</a> to provide energy on each land drop. The cartographer can drop on turn 2, and later on it can trade in energy for cards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/142/unstable-amulet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Unstable Amulet"><strong>Unstable Amulet</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/308/wurmcoil-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wurmcoil Engine"><strong>Wurmcoil Engine</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wurmcoil-engine.jpg?itok=KVSwIav2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wurmcoil-engine.jpg?itok=Hn3I5UCD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Instead of some of the pricer options in the deck, I would purpose Wurmcoil Engine is a very good option with being a 6/6 for 6 with useful abilities, who creates tokens when it dies. It’s a perfect target to copy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, swinging for 6, gaining 6 life, and leaving you two 3/3s behind.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/moc/373/scrap-trawler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scrap Trawler"><strong>Scrap Trawler</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scrap-trawler.jpg?itok=VOKQtFkB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scrap-trawler.jpg?itok=t_1zf7z4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Scrap Trawler leans into the artifact and sacrifice side of the deck, by turning all your deck artifacts into resurrection spells. Since <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>’s ability makes copies, those copies also have the originals mana value, meaning you can grab pricey artifacts from the graveyard, along with cheap ones.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/104/electrosiphon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Electrospiphon"><strong>Electrosiphon</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/electrosiphon.jpg?itok=rlw4MFP- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/electrosiphon.jpg?itok=DvfpgGDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s keep drawing on that <em>Fallout </em>precon, this time with the best energy counterspell. While 3 mana is more than ideally you spent on a counter, the ability to get a bunch of energy from it makes it worthwhile in Electrosiphon’s case.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/106/aether-refinery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aether Refinery"><strong>Aether Refinery</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-refinery.jpg?itok=s8dT4i5_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-refinery.jpg?itok=g9oacRhA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You can put <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/216/doubling-season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Doubling Season">Doubling Season </a>in this spot too, but Aether Refinery is a lot cheaper moneywise, and does what you’re wanting, while providing an energy outlet for big tokens. Given the deck's energy hunger, adding some explosive energy generation seems useful.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>If you want to see what the deck might look like with those 10 cards added, I’ve put it up on Archidekt, with 10 potential cuts that you can <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/11071535/living_energy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Living Energy Upgraded">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, our <em>Living Energy </em>review finds it is a slow, rampy deck with a lot of synergy and a number of different ways you can customize it. With <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>energy theme, two other commander decks in slightly different colors that use energy in the past year, the cards for this archtype are as cheaply available as they’ll be right now.</p>

The “Space-Time Smackdown” set will be released on the app on January 30, primarily featuring Pokémon from the Nintendo DS games <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>. I am a Sinnoh sicko, so seeing Pokémon from that region like my boys Torterra, the grass/ground-type tortoise with a whole ecosystem on the back of its shell, and Palkia, the dragon god of space, featured in any capacity is alright by me. I’ve mostly stopped checking in on <em>TCGP</em>, but these exceptional full arts will get me back.</p><p>Space-Time Smackdown includes 207 new cards, and while the standard cards are great, the full-arts are easily the highlights. We’ll go through all of them, but I did want to specifically shout out the Dialga and Palkia full-art cards, which are both homages to previous cards featuring the god-like dragons in the Astral Radiance packs. Both cards also have “immersive” animations of the sort featured on rare cards in <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> that give you a new perspective on the artwork.</p><p>Click through to see all the full-art cards, and if you want to see every card in the set, you can check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/all-space-time-smackdown-cards-officially-revealed-from-pocket&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/all-space-time-smackdown-cards-officially-revealed-from-pocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PokéBeach’s</em></a></span> round-up of all 207. Also, it’s a shame this art isn’t available on physical cards. Sure, it would defeat the appeal of a separate app to collect on, but I would buy that Palkia card in a heartbeat. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af6cee377b269a62094d7ad788805382"

We know that the studio has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-patch-5-notes-final-dlc-update-1851747197&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-patch-5-notes-final-dlc-update-1851747197">completely moved on from last year’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span><em> </em>and is focused entirely on making the next <em>Mass Effect</em>. The studio says it’s being developed by a “core team” under the guidance of series veterans Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, and others.</p><p>From there, things get hazy. Here’s an excerpt <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from McKay’s brief blog post</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.</p><p>Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio. We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.</p></blockquote><p>Asked for comment, a spokesperson for EA declined to elaborate further. “The studio’s priority was <em>Dragon Age</em>,” they wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next <em>Mass Effect</em>. Now that <em>The Veilguard</em> has shipped, the studio’s full focus is <em>Mass Effect</em>.”</p><p>Back in June, BioWare offloaded its MMO <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-old-republic-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1850512473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-old-republic-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1850512473">to an outside developer</a></span> and laid of some of the staff associated with maintaining the ongoing multiplayer RPG. A few months later, the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laid off 50 more employees</a></span>, including some longtime veterans of the team. At the time, it was believed that this left BioWare with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-lays-off-50-employees-as-part-of-shift-towards-a-more-agile-and-more-focused-studio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-lays-off-50-employees-as-part-of-shift-towards-a-more-agile-and-more-focused-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a rough headcount of maybe 200</a></span>. It’s unclear how much lower that number has gone after this latest restructuring. </p><p>It would be unusual for a “core” team in early production on a game to consist of over 100 people. EA declined to say how many people BioWare still employs. “While we’re not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on<em> Mass Effect </em>at this stage of development,” the spokesperson wrote in the email to <em>Kotaku</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN </em>reports</a></span> that while some employees were moved to other projects within EA, some staff who had been working on <em>The Veilguard </em>were laid off.</p><p>Today’s announcement comes roughly a week after former BioWare producer Mark Darrah released a YouTube video in which he talked about his old studio only having one game to focus on for the first time in decades. Little is known about <em>Mass Effect 5</em>, including its official title. It was first teased <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">back at The Game Awards 2020</a></span> and was later confirmed to be a sequel of sorts to the original trilogy. </p><p>Darrah called the process of BioWare finding out it can’t work on more than one game at a time “painful” but also suggested the downsizing could have a silver lining for<em> Mass Effect</em>. “This might be great because what it means is that BioWare, for the first time really ever, is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all of its attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best <em>Mass Effect</em> it possibly can.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sony is dropping its formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC - but it's introducing in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be retroactively making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - and while it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">eventually relented</a>, that hasn't stopped it from requiring PSN accounts to play an increasing number of its PC ports since then. It's a move that's proven contentious among PC players, particularly given its original justification for PSN accounts on PC - to ensure the "safety and security" of online play - is considerably less convincing when many affected titles are single-player games.
</p>
<p>
But now, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">announced</a> something of a U-turn, confirming it'll be removing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-is-the-latest-playstation-game-to-require-a-psn-account-on-pc">mandatory PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its previously released and upcoming PC titles: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> (which launches this week), and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered (currently due in April).

<p>
In all four cases, PlayStation Network accounts will become "optional", but Sony is still eager enough for players to sign up and log into PSN that it's announced a new in-game content unlock initiative coming "soon" to the above games on PC.
</p><p>
Players that sign into a PlayStation Network account for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, for instance, will unlock the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit early. PSN accounts will also grant access to the Nora Valiant outfit in Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.
</p>
<p>
Over in God of War Ragnarok, a PSN account lets players unlock Kratos' Armour of the Black Bear set at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms rather than waiting until New Game Plus, and there's also a resource bundle containing 500 Hacksilver and 250 XP.
</p>
<p>
As for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a PSN account unlocks an Ellie skin inspired by Jordan's jacket in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, as well as 50 additional points to activate bonus features and unlock extras.
</p>
<p>
Sony hasn't yet said if it'll be making PSN accounts optional for all its all future single-player-focused PC releases (or if the changes mean impacted games will now be available in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">territories without PSN</a>), but it did confirm more PSN incentives are on the way. "Game creators at PlayStation Studios will continue to work on bringing more benefits to players who sign up for a PSN account," it wrote, "so be sure to follow studio channels for more information."

There are all kinds of healthy ways you can deal with this–friends and family, exercise, eating right, getting sleep–but you can also click compulsively around the internet looking for something to press the “maybe everything isn’t the worst” button in your brain. To aid you in the latter, I present: deer cam.</p><p>I’m not sure why YouTube dropped “Brownville's Food Pantry For Deer” in front of me, but I’m glad it did. It’s a livestream of some deer-feeding troughs in Brownville, Maine, filled with acorns, apples, and oats, according to <a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/life/animals/wildlife/brownville-food-pantry-for-deer-viewers-livestream-maine-wildlife/97-0cef22e5-bbe1-41dd-9953-9f83605f357f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">News Center Maine</a>. The livestream runs 24/7, with this year’s beginning on “December 16th and end[ing] when natural browse is easily available at the end of the winter season,” according to the channel description.&nbsp;</p><p>The basic premise is simple: The deer come and eat the food, and you watch them. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BrownvillesFoodPantryForDeer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple cameras</a> that focus on the troughs, a trail, a pond, and more. (There’s also a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dcM4M16Ic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bird buffet</a>” camera, which is the same thing, but for birds.) Every stream has a chat, where viewers have nicknamed the deer things like Star, Oreo, and Mr. Floof, and are also talking about the weather.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Brownville's Food Pantry For Deer &quot;Trough View&quot;" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASu9sqOT_Xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My favorite part, besides looking at the deer who look way too soft for animals I am not touching, is the sound: In the trough view right now, the deer are crunching away at their food, nosing around for the best goodies and doing that “looking around while chewing with their mouth open” thing animals sometimes do. They stomp around in the snow and snort, and it sounds like you’re right there with them instead of, if you’re me, sitting alone in your New York City apartment with your brain crawling after a morning spent listening to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFK Jr</a> talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrPEQOg864I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WABI TV</a> says the Food Pantry is run by the McMahon family, who are in their 16th season of feeding the deer to “help restore herd numbers” in their area. The McMahons feed the deer “approximately 700 pounds of oats daily,” which WABI says can cost up to $20,000 a year. Randy McMahon, who operates the Food Pantry, told News Center Maine, “The revenue we get from our YouTube channel helps up immensely. Without YouTube, we wouldn't be able to afford what we are doing.” There are multiple ways viewers can donate, and also a merch store.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/narrative-designer-job-description-video-games"><h3>Just What, Exactly, Does A Video Game’s Narrative Designer Do?</h3></a><p>'I think the largest&nbsp;misconception&nbsp;is that we're just writers'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the latest BioWare update on the development of the next Mass Effect stage, the developer says it does not “require support from the full studio,” and has moved several employees to other teams at Electronic Arts. While the developer says it is reimaging how the company works, it still touts the leadership of veterans of the original trilogy.</p>



<hr>



<p>Following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a “core team at BioWare” is hard at work on the next Mass Effect game, the company <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a blog post</a> today. However, an unclear number of employees have been moved to “other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.” IGN has also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a small number of Dragon Age team members have had their roles terminated.</p>



<p>In their post, BioWare highlighted members of the veteran leadership leading production on the next Mass Effect game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael Gamble: Manager and Producer on Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and Andromeda.</li>



<li>Preston Watamaniuk: Lead Designer on the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Parrish Ley: Cinematic Animator for the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Derek Watts: Art Director for the original trilogy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Many believe this next Mass Effect title is a make-or-break release for BioWare. Dragon Age: The Veilguard went through a lengthy, turbulent development cycle, and despite some critical success, the 1.5 million copies sold was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/">half of what Electronic Arts expected</a>. This combined with EA Sports FC 25 missing internal expectations resulted in a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-stock-drops-17-percent/">17% drop in EA’s stock value</a>. Veilguard’s game director Corrine Busch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/">left the company earlier this month</a>, after 18 years with the company.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's website recently listed a $15 price cut for the Xbox Series S, but don't expect the price drop to last (in fact, it's already gone back up by $5).</p><p>Earlier this week, Microsoft was advertising a $15 price cut on the 512GB all-digital robot white Xbox Series S console, bringing the price down to $285. Later in the week, Microsoft <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-s?xr=shellnav" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bumped the price up to $290</a>, where it stands currently. That's $10 off the normal $300 price point for the system, purchased directly from Microsoft.</p><p>This price cut isn't permanent, though. A Microsoft spokesperson told GameSpot, "Any pricing variations are part of temporary promotional offers."</p><p>The 1TB Xbox Series S console is not on sale, nor are any versions of the Xbox Series X consoles. Other retailers appear to be matching Microsoft's offer, as Amazon and Walmart are selling the same console for the same price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4435609-screenshot2025-01-29at1.53.03pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435609" data-ratio="0.48541114058355" data-width="1131" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4435609-screenshot2025-01-29at1.53.03pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435609"></a><figcaption>The Xbox Series S is on sale now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4435609-screenshot2025-01-29at1.53.03pm.png"></figure><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently talked about how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/" data-ref-id="1100-6529067">next Xbox should be more innovative to help compete in the market.</a> Spencer also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028">rejected the idea</a> that Microsoft could exit the video game hardware market.</p><p>"Our own hardware?

For example, werewolf superhero Wolfpack is one of the original Creature Commandos members in the comics, known for tearing through Nazi flesh with his claws and teeth. Unfortunately, however, his werewolf nature worked against him for Gunn’s version of the team. “I definitely considered Wolfpack, and, especially, Man-Bat (one of my faves),”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>he wrote. “But I knew I wanted to tell Weasel’s story so it felt like too many rabid and fuzzy characters.”</p><p>As much as it may anger comic book fanboys who decry any deviation from the source material, Gunn wanted to make <em>Creature Commandos</em> his own. He expressed interest in not simply copying the Creature Commandos lineup from the comic books, even if it meant excluding fan-favorites. </p><p>“I considered Vincent Velcoro but wanted to choose a ‘creature’ far outside the usual roster from another part of DC - so I went with Dr. Phosphorous instead.

The project is said to be in early development and is expected to keep the video game experience’s non-linear narrative in mind as work progresses. Additional details, including casting information and release plans, have yet to be revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Page told Deadline that filming Beyond: Two Souls was “one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences” of his career. He continued: “The story’s rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Quantic Dream Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pageboy head of development and production Matt Jordan Smitt elaborated on how he, Page, and the rest of the team plan to “honor the game’s legacy while inviting fresh perspectives.” He added: “Delving into questions of survival and how split-second decisions can alter not just our lives, but the lives of others, are key to telling the story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Beyond: Two Souls launched for the PlayStation 3 in 2013 before eventually making its way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/20/beyond-two-souls-releases-on-playstation-4-next-week"><u>PlayStation 4</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/20/quantic-dream-epic-games-store-partner-to-release-detroit-heavy-rain-beyond-two-souls-on-pc"><u>PC</u></a> in 2015 and 2019, respectively. Directed and written by Quantic Dream’s David Cage, it follows the story of Jodie Holmes, a girl with psychic powers that allow her to communicate with a spirit she calls Aiden. Aside from the non-linear narrative that explores different sections of her life, the game was known for its inclusion of big-name actors like Page and Willem Dafoe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cage said he is collaborating with Page on the Beyond: Two Souls TV show, though the extent of his involvement is unclear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are absolutely thrilled to collaborate again with Elliot Page on this project,” Cage said. “I was blown away by his acting performance in the game, and I couldn’t think of anyone else to tell this story with the same passion on another medium.<em> Beyond: Two Souls </em>is a very special game for millions of players around the world who were moved by the story of Jodie and Aiden, and their journey in life and beyond. I know that Elliot has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be some time before the Beyond: Two Souls TV series makes its debut.

"We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands that EA has already placed an unknown number of developers from BioWare into other, equivalent roles within the company. A smaller number of Dragon Age team members are also seeing their roles terminated, and are being offered time to apply to other roles within the company if they so choose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare's structure has shifted repeatedly in recent years. The studio had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">a round of layoffs in 2023</a>., and has seen a number of high-profile departures throughout the development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the most recent of which was<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-reportedly-exits-bioware"> director Corinne Busche</a> announcing her departure from the studio last week. It is unclear how many individuals work at BioWare today. IGN asked EA for any comment or specifics on how many individuals at BioWare are being impacted by this change, how many are facing potential layoffs, and how many will remain at the studio. EA did not provide the specifics, but a spokesperson offered the following comment:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Mass Effect in question was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mass-effect-project-is-in-development-at-bioware-with-a-veteran-team">announced four years ago</a>, and is still in the early stages of development. IGN understands that BioWare's current strategy is to prioritize one game at a time, as some developers who had been working on Mass Effect were previously moved to Dragon Age to get the project over the finish line and are now moving back. Per the blog post, Mass Effect development is now being led by series veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news comes a week after EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million">announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard missed its player targets</a> by nearly 50% and reduced its guidance for the fiscal year due to this and, more impactfully, weaker-than-expected results from EA Sports FC 25. The company will hold its Q3 earnings conference call on February 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s due out on PC, consoles, and XR devices, although the platform specifics and release date are yet to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer, below, doesn't give much away, teasing the premise of the game with a live-action set-up before a glimpse at what to expect from the art style. Resolution Games is yet to show off gameplay or any screenshots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards of the Coast SVP of Digital Strategy &amp; Licensing Eugene Evans said that Resolution Games is taking a different approach to Dungeons &amp; Dragons by putting the emphasis on fast, turn-based combat and pick-up-and-play mechanics.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlemarked adapts D&amp;D classes, actions, and lore to Resolution Games’ Demeo action role-playing system, which is DM-less and focuses on social strategy rather than social roleplay. This, Resolution Games said, encourages group tabletalk focused on tactics and decision-making.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With the launch of Demeo back in 2021, we began to grow an incredible relationship with the D&amp;D player community,” said Tommy Palm, founder and CEO of Resolution Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Demeo and Demeo Battles quickly became a game night substitute for Dungeon Masters who wanted an out-of-campaign way to have fun with their groups, and for D&amp;D players to introduce their friends and family to tabletop miniatures games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s cross-platform support for up to four players co-operatively, with two story-based campaigns at launch and additional campaigns in different D&amp;D settings planned as downloadable content in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/gog-wants-your-dreamlist-classic-games-so-it-can-use-them-to-prod-publishers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p><em>Black &amp; White</em> was intriguing; it had classic Molyneaux over-reach and deserves, in the words of one Ars staffer, a re-release so that "a new generation can realize just how janky it is." As detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtNvEna6bxc">a documentary by Noclip</a>, the <em>B&amp;W </em>games are stuck in publishing purgatory. Microsoft acquired Lionhead's IP and assets, while Electronic Arts retains the publishing rights to the <em>B&amp;W&nbsp;</em>games, and nobody has yet been able to align those two very large planets.</p>
<p>GOG has added its own "Our Pick" tag to games it wants to see brought forward onto modern systems. Among them is <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/freelancer">Freelancer</a>,</em> which Ars' Samuel Axon described in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">our 2024 roundup of non-2024 games</a> as "a sincere attempt to make games like <em>Elite (Dangerous)</em> and <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> far more accessible." GOG selected <em>Freelancer</em> as <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/dreamlist-gog-staff-picks/">one of its staff picks</a> for the Dreamlist, citing its "dynamic economy and engaging storyline."</p>
<p>The main thing GOG would be fixing with&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>, as with many games, would be simple availability, as the game is not available on any proper digital storefront. Axon reports that, in having an original disc, installing <em>Freelancer</em> was not too hard, with the installer working in Windows 11. You can apply <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Freelancer">community patches</a>, like an "HD Edition" mod, but Axon preferred playing at a non-native resolution (1024×768) at 4:3 and adjusting his monitor.</p>
<p>Other notable games GOG and its voting public want to see brought back are <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>&nbsp;</em>(the original, not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-on-pc-a-gorgeous-start-but-where-are-the-toggles/">the remake</a>), the point-and-click <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/discworld"><em>Discworld </em></a>adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection"><em>Command &amp; Conquer: The Ultimate Collection</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever">The Operative: No One Lives Forever</a>.</em></p>

                <p>In the wake of EA's announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company's expectations</a>, BioWare has announced that it is "changing how we build games" in an effort to hold the company to "the highest quality standards."</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, BioWare GM Gary McKay said "a core team" at BioWare is making the next Mass Effect, while other team members are departing. McKay said BioWare has "worked diligently" in the past months to find new positions for BioWare staffers at other internal EA teams. Whether or not there were layoffs connected to these changes, however, is unknown. The Veilguard game director Corinne Busch has left BioWare.</p><p>"In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare," McKay said.</p><p>McKay added that, because the next Mass Effect game is so early in development, the studio doesn't "require support from the full studio."</p><p>"Today's news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare," McKay said.</p><p>EA management said earlier this month that The Veilguard "engaged" 1.5 million players, which was a big miss from the 3 million that EA expected. Whether or not this had anything to do with the structural changes at BioWare is unknown.</p><p>BioWare's track record in the past decade has been checkered. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-wins-goty-at-game-awards/1100-6424005/" data-ref-id="1100-6424005">Dragon Age: Inquisition won Game of the Year</a> in 2014, but 2015 saw the cancellation of BioWare's multiplayer game Shadow Realms. Then in 2017, BioWare released Mass Effect: Andromeda, and many remarked that it failed to live up to the franchise's lofty quality benchmarks. BioWare followed Andromeda up with Anthem, a multiplayer live-service game that faced its own share of issues and criticisms. Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which included remastered versions of the original Mass Effect trilogy, followed in 2021 and was well-regarded.</p><p>As mentioned, BioWare is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mass-effect-features-several-veterans-on-its-development-team/1100-6485584/" data-ref-id="1100-6485584">now working on the next Mass Effect with a veteran team</a>, but no one should expect it to release anytime soon.</p>

<p>If you follow Insider Gaming, you know a few of us are huge fans of the extraction shooter genre. We play the top games in the genre in our spare time, and we’re always watching new and indie releases in the scene. But few delve into the horror scene. Now, horror extraction shooter Level Zero: Extraction has hit 1.0 with a massive patch, a vast content revamp, and even a new game mode!</p>







<p>You can check out the full patch notes below, but the developer sent over a little release detailing everything different in 1.0 compared to the Early Access version of the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Most lights are now on by default. Alien Monsters now take damage from UV light—flashlights, glowsticks, and flares have been changed to UV;</li>



<li>Lots of new grenades &amp; weapons as well as attachments for the guns, including optics;</li>



<li>Research Facility map size increased, added two new sectors—Medblock and Radiation Tests—that require access cards to enter, printable on the map itself;</li>



<li>Mutation system for Alien Monsters: Aliens progress each session, gaining mutations that alter gameplay and add a new power layer;</li>



<li>Improved shooting, animations, item swap, and movement;</li>



<li>Contract system rework: Items are now shown on the holomap;</li>



<li>Leaderboard section: Filtering by kills, K/D, extractions, etc.</li>



<li>Rebalanced economy after a series of iterations;</li>
</ul>











<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1456940/view/500562881802142345?mc_cid=125b97a780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> below or via the game’s Steam page:</p>



<h3><strong>Revamped the Caves of Turion map as a “battle royale-like” experience</strong></h3>



<p>Here’s a list of changes:</p>



<ol>
<li>The main elevator can only extract three Mercs; as the session approaches its end, the elevator can’t be called;</li>



<li>Two additional solo exits that are one-time only;</li>



<li>Better loot;</li>



<li>A ring of erosion starts moving toward the central elevator 10 minutes into the session;</li>



<li>Aliens are immune to ring of erosion damage.</li>
</ol>



<h3><strong>💼 A “Mercs Only” mode</strong></h3>



<p>This is a separate optional mode for Mercs only. It offers a more forgiving experience without Alien Monsters, but the loot is of a slightly lower tier.</p>



<h3><strong>OTHER CHANGES:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Final screen UI rework</strong>:<br>
<ol>
<li>Causes of death;</li>



<li>Names of all the people in the lobby with more details about what happened to them during the session;</li>



<li>An ability to add friends.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>New skin attribution system</strong>: Skins are now obtainable through achievement-style goals and are never reset after completion.</li>



<li>New Alien Monster feature:&nbsp;<strong>Cocoons</strong>. When playing as an Alien, wrap a dead Merc in a cocoon; if it stays intact until the end of the session, you get a share of the loot that the Merc was carrying.</li>



<li>New weapon:&nbsp;<strong>Sniper rifle</strong></li>



<li>New grenades:&nbsp;<strong>Gas, UV Flashbang</strong></li>



<li><strong>Revised economy</strong>&nbsp;with faster progression</li>



<li><strong>Steam Friends through in-game UI</strong>. You can add other players as friends during a session—a pop-up will appear above them.</li>



<li><strong>Matchmaking update</strong>: Locked regions. If you choose a region, you will only look for games in that region.</li>



<li>Various&nbsp;<strong>UI &amp; UX Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-general-changes"><strong>General Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Added matchmaking lock for the 1.0 release to provide better latency, matching players in specific regions without expanding matchmaking to other regions.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-research-facility-changes"><strong>Research Facility Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Increased the amount and chance of weapon spawns in the warehouse and airdrops.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-caves-of-turion-changes"><strong>Caves of Turion Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The central elevator is no longer called but instead arrives on a timer and leaves 2 minutes after arriving. Max capacity: 3 mercs;</li>



<li>The bore exit can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The Grappling Hook exit can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The solo elevator can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The loot quality on Caves of Turion has been increased.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-merc-changes"><strong>Merc Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Reduced prices for items and weapons;</li>



<li>Headshot multiplier has been reduced from x3 to x2 against mercs;</li>



<li>Rebalanced damage for all weapons according to the new headshot multiplier;</li>



<li>Added a distinct sound for headshots;</li>



<li>The starter kit weapon changed to FoxFive;</li>



<li>Increased recoil for most of the weapons by 20-30% (reverted recoil changes);</li>



<li>Reduced the amount of stamina it takes for a melee attack for both one-handed and two-handed melee weapons;</li>



<li>Reduced the damage of marksmanship rifles;</li>



<li>Removed icons of card printers from the holo map when they’re active;</li>



<li>New item: Gas Grenade, working as a perfect mix between smoke grenade and alien’s acid cloud ability;</li>



<li>New item: UV Flashbang. It doesn’t blind mercs, but it will do heavy damage to aliens close to the explosion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, note that this update includes a complete server wipe, meaning your entire stash, trader rep, and levels will disappear, but your cosmetic skins will remain.</p>
