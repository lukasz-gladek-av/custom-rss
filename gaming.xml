            <p>A trademark for Control Resonant has been applied for in Europe by a law firm who've represented <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> developers Remedy on numerous previous occasions. This application's been lodged not long before The Game Awards and is to permit the phrase to be used in relation to games, but at the moment it's still a mystery what exact sort of Control-related thing it refers to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647">trademark</a>, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1ST</a>, was applied for yesterday - November 27th - through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. If granted, the mark would allow Control Resonant to be used by the new holders in relation to video game software and hardware, as well as "audio, video and multimedia production" (something that covers the likes of TV series and films). Some likely merch-related bits including clothing, lanyards, printed books, and posters are also part of it.</p>
<p>The trademark doesn't list Remedy's name directly, but it has been filed by the Finnish branch of a law firm called Nordia. A search on Nordia's website shows they've <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-announces-the-result-of-the-share-issue/">acted on Remedy's behalf</a> numerous times in the recent past, including <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-listing/">advising on the company's stock exchange listing</a> and <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-remedys-contract-negotiation-with-annapurna/">helping negotiate</a> the partnership Remedy shook hands on with Annapurna Pictures in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>'s development's been underway for a little while, so there's a chance this trademark could be related to that. However, the fact the listing covers TV and film adaptations, something Annapurna got permission to pursue with both Control and Alan Wake in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">partnership deal from last year</a>, means that this listing could also be about something along those lines. Either way, you'd expect there to be plenty of merch to buy, so that aspect doesn't help point in either direction.</p><p>Beyond that, there's not much to be read into Control Resonant as a potential name, at least from where I'm sitting. Resonant almost certainly has something to do with the resonance, that being what the Federal Bureau of Control dub the strange energy which powers all of the game's paranatural weirdness. All that really tells us is that this Control thing will be a Control thing. Breaking news. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to sit tight and see when Remedy whip out an explanation or reveal for this trademarked thing. Maybe hold off on buying a new lanyard until they do.</p>

            <p>A trademark for something known as Control: Resonant has been registered in Europe, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards next month.</p>
<p>The trademark itself was spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1st</a>, with the publication noting it has been classified under tags such as video game services, miscellaneous products and the production of entertainment in the form of TV series and cinematographic films.</p>

<p>While Control developer Remedy is not mentioned in the trademark's registration, Nordia Attorneys at Law is. This is the same firm Remedy has used for its previous trademarks.</p>
<p>As for what the end product could actually be, Remedy has already announced a Control sequel. There is also a Control-flavoured film or TV <em>something</em> in the pipeline. In 2024, Annapurna announced it had partnered with Remedy to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">develop and produce film, TV and audiovisual projects based on the studio's Alan Wake and Control franchises</a>.</p>

<p>Control's sequel was first announced back in 2022, with the developer simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">it would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details under wraps, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of last year it stated "important" Control 2 features were now in "playable form"</a>. The following November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-remedy-confirms">Remedy then confirmed the sequel will be an action-RPG</a>. A teaser for the sequel was also, perhaps, tucked away in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">The Game Awards 2025 just a couple of weeks away</a>, it seems that if Remedy has something more to share about Control: Resonant soon, that will be the time to do it. What do you hope Remedy is working on here?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Remedy news, earlier this year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak">studio's CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the company</a>. While Remedy's announcement did not indicate a reason for Virtala's departure after 11 years at the company, it followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">profit warning to investors</a> "due to weak sales" of the studio's multiplayer Control spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/</link>
            <guid>1367074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, modder xoxor4d released the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>. This public build even comes with a simple installer, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx/releases/tag/1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, making it relatively easy for users to install it.</p>



<p>Xoxor4d shared a detailed changelog of improvements over the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod test build that was released last month. You can find it below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a basic installer</li>



<li>Removed alpha blending on some emissive surfaces that were not supposed to be alpha-blended</li>



<li>Night emissives now turn off during the day</li>



<li>Map markers can now be shown/hidden based on the time of day or the current weather</li>



<li>Added a button to teleport yourself to a map marker</li>



<li>Added a FreeCam mode and added a new Utilities tab to the imgui menu</li>



<li>Reduced the default emissive intensity of some surfaces</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that broke the remix debug views</li>



<li>No longer using timecycle temperature because it was not related to color tuning - now using a hardcoded value + reduced influence</li>



<li>Added a special remix replacement to the first apartment</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Remix Runtime</em></p>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li>Added raindrops/splashes to wet world surfaces (disabled by default for pedestrians and vehicles because of varying UV scales, which makes raindrops really large on some cars and really small on others)</li>



<li>Added "puddle logic" to the global wetness code to break up the mirror-like surfaces</li>



<li>The <code>Ignore Lights</code> category can be used to disable the <code>WorldUI</code> texture tag that is automatically set on some emissive surfaces. This allows one to set custom emissive masks and tweaks via a remix replacement while keeping the dynamic intensity adjustment by the game</li>
</ul>



<p>The highlight of the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod is obviously that it injects path tracing into Rockstar's 2008 classic game. The result is a massive visual improvement, as you can see in the featured image and in the additional comparison screenshot below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GTA-4-RTX-Remix-Mod-PT-Comparison-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: MxBenchmark PC (YouTube)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, path tracing, like in any other PC game (and perhaps even more so in a mod that is not as well optimized as a full game for obvious reasons), is rather heavy on performance. As shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the MxBenchmark PC comparison video</a>, even NVIDIA's expensive GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card cannot run the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod at 60 frames per second without the help of DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Modder xoxor4d did have a couple of tips for those who may struggle with performance, though. Those who experience heavy stuttering can try to launch the mod using the included 'LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_2Cores_GTA4.bat' file. This will allocate two cores to GTA4 and the remaining cores to Remix. Another option is splitting your CPU cores 50/50 with NVIDIA RTX Remix; to do that, use the '_LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_Half_GTA4__Half_Remix.bat' file.</p>



<p>The path tracing settings can also be lowered a bit. Just like in every RTX Remix game, you can open the menu by pressing Alt + X. In the Graphics Settings Menu, switch to the Graphics tab and then adjust various quality settings in the Graphics Preset dropdown as needed.</p>



<p>Another tweak that might help performance (though it will also make leaves more blocky) is increasing the Tree Alpha Cutout Value. To do that, open the CompMod menu by pressing F4 and open the Rendering Related Settings container under the Game Settings tab.</p>



<p>Lastly, you can of course still tweak the quality and distance sliders in the regular Grand Theft Auto 4 graphics options. Keeping in mind that higher values will reach your CPU bottleneck earlier, the modder recommends starting with 50 for view distance and 30 for quality and adjusting from there. When making this adjustment, xoxor4d warned that the first launch might cause problems, but a second attempt should resolve the issue.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod can help Grand Theft Auto fans cope with the additional time they'll have to wait until the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> from the previous date of May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Rumors suggest Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-switch-2-explored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may even be trying to make the game run on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though even if that's happening, it would likely be launched at a later date.</p>

                <p>After previously working with Bandai Namco's studio in Singapore on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splatoon-3/" data-ref-id="5000-527230">Splatoon 3</a>, Nintendo has revealed that a deal has been struck to bring that developer in-house.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made the announcement</a> online, which notes that it will own 80% of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore by April 2026 per its agreement with Bandai Namco. The remaining 20% the Singapore studio will be purchased at a later date, "once the subsidiary's operations have stabilized."</p><p>The new name of the studio will be Nintendo Studios Singapore. Nintendo also noted that the studio was chosen for acquisition because it "has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo" and the publisher wanted to "strengthen" its internal development structure.</p><p>Bandai Namco Studios Singapore's collaborations with Nintendo included Mario Sports Superstars and New Pokemon Snap. It's also rumored to have been involved with Bandai Namco's version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4</a>, before the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/" data-ref-id="1100-6464593">completely redeveloped by Retro Studios</a> in 2019.</p><p>This deal doesn't appear to mean Bandai Namco is putting itself up for sale. Earlier this year, Bandai Namco struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">a $463 million deal with Sony</a> for approximately 2.5% of the company. Bandai Namco retains some of the biggest franchises in gaming, including Elden Ring, Tekken, and Pac-Man. However, the company has disclosed that a former employee allegedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-former-bandai-namco-employee-allegedly-embezzled-so-much-money-execs-had-to-take-a-pay-cut/1100-6533562/" data-ref-id="1100-6533562">embezzled so much money from Bandai Namco</a> that its executives have taken a pay cut.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Project Motor Racing Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/project-motor-racing-review</link>
            <guid>1367050</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m parked at the back of the grid on Mount Panorama, awaiting the race start, and there are cars ahead of me literally facing backwards. This is not going to go well. As you’d expect, pandemonium ensues when the lights go off. The race has just begun and it’s already a mess. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is Project Motor Racing in a nutshell right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Project Motor Racing is precisely the sort of racing game I want to play. It has a great selection of cars, a number of which are thoroughly underrepresented in modern racers. It’s also not crippled with free-to-play chicanery or subject to a monthly subscription, and its focus <em>isn’t</em> primarily multiplayer. All of this is high-octane music to my ears. In practice, however, Project Motor Racing simply hasn’t worked out, and I’ve totally bounced off it in its current state thanks to AI that essentially ignores your presence on track, a hopelessly uneven penalty system that serves only to frustrate and ruin your races, and its array of bugs and peculiar physics quirks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Motor Racing arrives as a spiritual successor to Slightly Mad Studios’ now-defunct Project CARS series, which failed to survive the Codemasters acquisition of Slightly Mad (and the subsequent EA purchase of Codemasters). There may be some different logos on the loading screen, sure, but developer Straight4 Studios is basically a rebirthed Slightly Mad after someone hit the VIN with an angle grinder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps more specifically, it’s attempting to pick up where Project CARS 2 left off – brushing aside the bafflingly casual reinvention of the series in Project CARS 3. If you need a comparison to chew on, it’s a little like how Jaws 4 ignores the events of Jaws 3D. Unfortunately, just like Jaws 4, things get real fishy, real fast.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Superficial Intelligence</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, Project Motor Racing’s single-player set up has a good base and I do like how malleable it initially is, with three starting budget figures that give us the flexibility to approach the career mode however we choose. That is, you can select to begin with just enough cash to scrape into the entry-level categories, or a wallet big enough to buy any car on offer and head straight to the top classes. It’s smart that it has these options. There are actually slots to have three separate careers on the go simultaneously, so it’s possible to experiment with multiple approaches (or, in my instance, for my sons to dabble with their own career saves without messing around with mine – an underrated addition to any racing game).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do like how malleable it initially is, with three starting budget figures that give us the flexibility to approach the career mode however we choose.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your in-game payouts can also be tweaked to fit your playstyle. For instance, you can opt to keep things simple and take a flat payout per event, or you can mix it up and take bonuses for winning only – or even have your damage repair bills covered in return for a steady portion of your event takings. This is an equally smart way of slinging out credits to us, regardless of how differently you or I may plan to go about our racing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The management component plateaus here, though, since there are no other meaningful aspects to it. There’s no in-game way of creating a custom team appearance for the cars you buy and race, or applying sponsor logos. In this regard, don’t expect anything like, say, the recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nascar-25-review">NASCAR 25</a>. Support for mods is a much-touted feature of Project Motor Racing on both PC and console – and I have no doubt that many recognisable liveries will be convincingly recreated and available via user-created mods – but mods feel unlikely to fill this specific gap. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you have a team and a car, the campaign mode becomes a simple matter of selecting a championship or event, paying the entry fee, and competing. At this point, the overall objective is really that of any real-life race driver – spend your work days at high speed on 18 world-famous race tracks and do your best to win (or, failing that, not send your team bankrupt). This approach works for me. Or, at least, it would have, if Project Motor Racing had not been so bafflingly irritating to race in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The racing is frustratingly close to being entirely decent, but it’s currently completely undermined by its aggressively oblivious AI and its brazenly unfair penalty system – both of which are so annoying I have no desire to keep playing at the moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The racing is frustratingly close to being entirely decent, but it’s currently completely undermined by its aggressively oblivious AI and its brazenly unfair penalty system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big problem with the AI is that they regularly drive like you’re not on track. I’m not just talking about them coming across on you when you only have a slight overlap and probably got optimistic sticking your nose there in the first place (although they <em>will </em>do that, and watching the replays exposes that they’ll do so by sometimes clipping through your front end like you’re a ghost). I’m talking about the absolute argy-bargey that occurs when you’re right alongside them and they want to carry on sticking to the racing line like freight trains, so they thump into you with zero regard for your existence. It certainly doesn’t help that it currently features no radar or proximity indicators for the cars around you, and no spotter either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On PS5, the single-player opponent count is actually limited to just 15 (crossplay multiplayer allows up to 32). Frankly, 15 isn’t near enough for a racing sim of this type but, considering the way they drive, I guess I don’t know that I’d want any more of these lunatics out there right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be clear, my favourite real-world racing categories are old school Super Touring and V8 Supercars, so I am unequivocally all for elbows-out, panel-punishing racing in my games, too – but this just takes the piss. Project Motor Racing’s AI regularly reminds me more of classic Gran Turismo, where the AI racers always felt exponentially heavier and generally incapable of being affected by the player’s car. To experiment, I’ve cannoned into the back of opponents for no result. They just carry on cornering without losing a position, while I’m parked in the gravel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue is compounded by a ruinously strict track limit penalty system that will just nuke your whole race for zero reason. Get bumped off track by the AI? That’ll be a two-second penalty for breaching track limits. It doesn’t matter that it wasn’t your fault, and it doesn’t matter that you’ll have already likely lost time because of it. If you have the opponent strength slider set at just the right level to have your times toe-to-toe with the AI, two seconds can be a lifetime. It just immediately ruins races. It’s a real buzzkill to be in the groove, lapping consistently with the pack a bit spread out, and thinking, “You know what? This actually feels pretty good right now” – then, bam; tiny moment, dud penalty.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Get bumped off track by the AI? That’ll be a two-second penalty for breaching track limits.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For comparison, Assetto Corsa Competizione also dishes out penalties, but only if it detects an advantage. If you’re forced off track – or if your ego writes a cheque your tyres can’t cash and you grab a bit of impromptu dirt on a corner exit – ACC won’t penalise you if you didn’t <em>benefit </em>from the off-track excursion. Project Motor Racing is the exact opposite, whacking you with penalties for tiny mistakes that have <em>already </em>cost you time. Hell, they don’t even have to be tiny; you can spin, get overtaken by the whole field, and <em>still </em>be slapped with a two-second penalty the moment you rejoin. I wasn’t cheating; I was <em>crashing</em>. Confusingly, I had better luck <em>actually </em>cheating, because the penalty system allowed me to blast straight ahead at T1 on Project Motor Racing’s off-brand version of Monza, pay my dues by slowing to 60km/h, and immediately go from 16th to 1st. This is repeatable, too – and sometimes I actually didn’t get penalised at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, it’s thanks to the penalty system I certainly have no interest playing the career on “authentic” difficulty, which locks the opponent strength at 100 and does not allow race restarts. This might be a problem if trophies are important to you, because a horde of them are tied up behind completing the career on “authentic”. Authentic mode is optional, but Project Motor Racing would do well to remember we’re not <em>all </em>as quick as real racing drivers when we play video games. That’s <em>why </em>I play video games. For now, any time I get pinged unfairly in my current career I typically just hit the pause menu and try again. I just need to hope that everyone is facing the right way when we restart. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Storm is Coming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Motor Racing’s weaknesses on track are annoying considering how much I like its current garage, and doubly so considering how excited I was to learn that Australian touring cars from two separate eras of the Supercars series are planned to arrive as DLC later next year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Motor Racing features over 70 cars, and I admire the distilled approach of focusing strictly on racing models. Ferrari and McLaren appear to have turned down a seat at the table for now – which does create some hefty holes in the categories it focuses on – but it’s particularly neat to see some of the old GT and N-GT cars that rarely get much love in contemporary racing games. For instance, I’ve always had a soft spot for the Lister Storm and its 7.0l V12. After all, there ain’t no replacement for displacement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cars look nice in the menu screens, but they’re not as glamorous out on track. In action, it’s actually quite washed out, and it absolutely does not look a generation newer than the excellent Project CARS 2. Damage is underwhelming, as is the rain. There are a lot of layers to the sound, which does capture a good deal of the raw, mechanical noises of a race car – although broadly speaking there’s room for improvement, and I’d love the engine notes to be a little thicker and throatier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of how the cars handle, however, I’m tugged in two directions – literally, in this instance. There’s really nothing more important to a race sim than the handling, and I have to say there are some car and track combos in Project Motor Racing where I’ve felt very satisfied with the overall feel on a wheel (the only PlayStation wheel I have is the Thrustmaster T-GT II, which isn’t a direct-drive wheel, but is about as good as belt-driven wheels get in terms of force feedback). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in a GT3 car like the Audi R8 or the Ford Mustang at Mount Panorama, I can lap clean and the cars feel compliant beneath me. Am I as quick as a real GT3 driver? Not at all, and I’m probably underdriving the cars by some margin – but it does all feel quite intuitive to me at the speed I race. The buzz from kerbs is strong, and the sensation of weight fluctuating is impressively pronounced – like everything lightening up for a beat as you barrel over a crest and your car becoming heavier and stickier as you scoot from the end of a slope. This is a big factor on a track with such profound elevation changes, like Bathurst. The disparity in performance on a cold tyre versus a warm tyre is also huge in Project Motor Racing, and the very real necessity to drive the first lap or so more delicately is also a satisfying enough challenge here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been far less confident in other cars, however. The hypercars are the worst culprits. They just want me dead. Obviously I’m not a professional racing driver, and I’m not going to speak to you like I am – or act like I know exactly what’s going on beneath the surface of something like Project Motor Racing when it comes to simulating a Le Mans prototype. The hypercars, however, are undriveable out of the box – even on a wheel. They pull left and right, they slip, slide, and scrub – and there’s just zero feeling of the immense downforce I expected. For clarity, we’re talking about cars that produce four times as much downforce as they do drag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, on gamepad, the news is worse. It’s just way too twitchy to be a satisfying sim on a standard controller – especially when the tiniest erroneous flick of a stick can mean a nonsense penalty. I tried dialling down the sensitivity of the steering, but it really had little effect. Cars (especially the prototypes) get so unsettled when steering from left to right on a gamepad I just can’t really recommend picking up Project Motor Racing if that’s exclusively the way you plan to play it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/project-motor-racing-review]]></content:encoded>

Out of all of Lego's gaming system sets, Pac-Man Arcade is probably the most impressive from a design perspective. And it's definitely the coolest when it comes to interactive features. It has a movable four-way joystick, and you can press the two dome buttons. The crank on the side of the cabinet moves Pac-Man through the mechanical maze while Blinky and Clyde chase him.</p><p>The coin slot uses a light brick that makes it look like the real thing. In addition to the cabinet itself, it comes with buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures that attach to a stand that connects to the top of the cabinet.</p><p>Rounding out the set is a minifigure-scale '80s arcade scene, complete with a tiny brick-built Pac-Man cabinet and a gamer minifigure wearing vintage clothes. You can store the scene inside the cabinet by removing the back panel. This also allows you to watch the mechanical components in motion while turning the crank.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Amazon Black Friday Sale: Best Lego Deals (Nov. 28)</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRW6VY43?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Battle Droid with STAP (1,088 pieces)</a> -- $90 (<del>$140</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Anniversary-Collectible/dp/B0CGYH4VG8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Tantive IV (654 pieces)</a> -- $40 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Collectible-Anniversary/dp/B0CGY4QJTC?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Boarding the Tantive IV (502 pieces)</a> -- $38.49 (<del>$55</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-PAC-Man-Building-Replica-Nostalgic/dp/B0CGYQ2WJC?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 pieces)</a> -- $189 (<del>$270</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Technic-Champions-McLaren-Exciting/dp/B0CX2Z2Z4K?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Technic &amp;

<p>According to Insider Gaming, a new job listing from Sledgehammer Games - seeking a "Senior Technical Artist" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/">has surfaced on LinkedIn</a>, and in the 'Bonus XP' section of the application, the team notes how it would appreciate someone with "AAA mobile or Switch experience".</p><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdyqxhji&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Although Sledgehammer only provided support on the latest Call of Duty title, it has previously taken the reins for major titles such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3"><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This small discovery follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">an update earlier this year in June 2025</a>, with a report at the time suggesting Microsoft and Nintendo still had plans to announce <em>something</em> related to this series in the future.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">entered a 10-year commitment</a> to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the deal becoming legally binding in 2023. This was followed by Microsoft being given the all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition in the same year.</p>
<p>According to a previous story, Sledgehammer Games is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-office/">rumoured to be releasing its next Call of Duty</a> title in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-technical-rundown-detailed-by-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>1367008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1c4b88860f604"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c4b88860f604/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is out for the Switch 2 next week, and ahead of launch, Ubisoft has published a "deep dive" on its website about the technical aspects of this port. Here's the summary:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="frame-rate">Frame Rate</h3>
<p>Firstly, in both docked and handheld modes, the frame rate will target 30 fps. The resolution was not included here.</p>
<h3 id="adapting-to-switch-2">Adapting to Switch 2</h3>
<p>As for adapting the title to Nintendo's new system, the team says it has done <em>a lot</em> of "code-level work" to optimise and adapt the game architecture. This includes "modifying game assets to streamline certain technical aspects of the quality" without compromising the overall player experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Behind the scenes, we've worked a lot to make the world run smoothly and remain visually stunning and dynamic... For example, we're using the same cloud and cloth simulation systems, but we've optimized certain elements for the ARM processor and downscaled simulation data where needed to reduce GPU load, all while preserving visual fidelity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the Switch 2 supports Ray-Traced Global Illumination, the team has opted to use its solid baked Global Illumination system (which it also uses for "low-spec PC setups and Xbox Series S versions" of games), citing "RAM memory reasons" as the main decision behind this. It apparently allows the developers to preserve the overall experience as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>
<p>In terms of optimisation – Level of Detail (LOD), draw distances, texture resolution and element loading were all "carefully adjusted to maintain performance without compromising the world's depth", with the environmental richness of the world still "largely intact". However, NPC counts have been reduced in highly populated areas to maintain "smooth gameplay".</p>
<h3 id="dlss">DLSS</h3>
<p>DLSS has also been utilised, resulting in a "sharper image, with more accurate colors, improved textures, and fewer visual anomalies". Performance is described as being "smoother, offering higher FPS through upscaling, better fluidity, and reduced latency".</p>
<h3 id="handheld-and-docked-experience">Handheld and Docked experience</h3>
<p>The same post goes into more detail about each mode on Switch 2 – explaining how handheld mode is GPU-limited, with adjustments to image quality, draw distance and LOD settings to prioritise performance. And in docked, players can expect HDR support. VRR is also leveraged in handheld, offering "smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>One feat, in particular, is how "the lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 fps, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 fps on Switch 2" and the team "didn't want to compromise on that aspect" so it built a "dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 fps" to ensure the experience remains as "fluid and responsive as possible".</p>
<h3 id="switch-2-specific-features">Switch 2-specific features</h3>
<p>Last but not least are some Switch 2-specific features including touch screen navigation for menus and maps. Nintendo players can also expect this version to include "all post-launch content" excluding the "Claws of Awaji expansion" due out in 2026. Cross-progression is supported as well via Ubisoft Connect, so you can continue your adventure across platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Control Resonant Trademark Discovered Ahead of The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-trademark-remedy-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1366993</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A possible trademark registration from Remedy may hint at a new Control project. Furthermore, its timing is coincidentally near <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>, set to go live on December 11th.</p>



<p>The Control series is a fairly new series, starting in 2019. The first sci-fi mind-bending title follows new Director, Jesse Faden, as she travels the mysterious Oldest House. When it released, Remedy Entertainment and the game were praised immensely, receiving multiple year-end awards and nominations. While not a direct sequel, the multiplayer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-remedy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak </a>does take place in the Oldest House and ties into Control. The series is connected to the wider world of Remedy, including Alan Wake and it’s sequel’s DLC. However, a new trademark may hint at an even bigger expansion to the universe, if done by Remedy.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-control-project-may-be-in-the-works-at-remedy-trademark-hints">A New Control Project May Be In The Works at Remedy, Trademark Hints</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A trademark for CONTROL Resonant was filed by Remedy today ahead of The Game Awards on the EUIPO site.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the European Union Intellectual Property Office website, the title <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“CONTROL Resonant”</a> has been filed for trademark. In addition, it’s been done by Nordia Attorneys at Law LTD. Interestingly enough, Remedy Entertainment uses those lawyers, making it seem like this is, indeed, a new Control title.</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that Remedy has not announced a new title or project for Control, so take it with a grain of salt for the time being. As to what it could be, there are a few different ways. The most obvious is a sequel to the 2019 original, possibly continuing Jesse Faden’s narrative. However, Remedy has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s been exploring film and TV</a>, so maybe Control: Resonant is a TV series.</p>



<p>Of course, the timing is rather convenient, as The Game Awards 2025 are just around the corner on December 11th. Remedy is no stranger to the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2023-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control had huge presences there, both as nominees/winners and reveals. Sam Lake, the face of the studio, is a frequent presenter at the awards and it wouldn’t be surprising if the company decides to reveal Control Resonant, if true. Either way, it’s more Control and fans are sure to enjoy that.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new Control trademark? Think it’s a sequel? TV show? Something else? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Nintendo continues to promote its latest game releases with new events in its mobile runner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and next up is a collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p>
<p>This event is already underway and like previous events, you'll be able to unlock themed statues. For this particular one, this includes statues for Bee Mario, Rosalina and Balloon Yoshi. During this event, one course will be open a day for free.</p>
<p>Here's a look at each of these statues, with the event scheduled to run from now until <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2992fd063fde2"><a title="Super Mario Run" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2992fd063fde2/super-mario-run.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows previous Super Mario Run events for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brother Ship</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo released Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the Switch last month. If you haven't already played it, we can confirm it's still out of this world, even if the entire package comes at a high price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages...These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-ditches-ipad-air-pride-on-amazon-own-site-still-pretends-nothing-changed-2000648171</link>
            <guid>1366978</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple maintains its tradition of avoiding Black Friday deals on their own retail website while quietly liquidating inventory through Amazon with more generous discounts than previous years.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> At $449, down from $599, this 11-inc 128GB/WiFi iPad Air (M3 chip) joins Apple discounting</a> spanning MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches, and iPads. The only product category notably absent from Amazon’s Black Friday Apple selection remains the iPhone 17 series, which still hasn’t launched on Amazon’s platform despite being available through carriers and Apple directly. This 25% discount on the<strong> iPad Air represents a record-low price</strong> for Apple’s mainstream tablet that balances capability with accessibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Between the Basic iPad and the Pro Models</h2>
<p>The basic iPad costs about $329 and comes with an A14 chip from the previous generation and a standard Retina display, and it’s for people who want a cheap device for browsing and basic productivity. The <strong>M3 chip in the iPad Air gives it a lot more processing power</strong> because it has desktop-class architecture that can handle demanding games and creative applications that would be too much for the basic model. The <strong>Liquid Retina display with P3 wide color and True Tone is better</strong> than the basic iPad’s display because it has more colors, better viewing angles, and adaptive white balance.</p>



<p>The iPad Pro positioned above the Air commands $800+ through M4 chip, mini-LED ProMotion displays reaching 120Hz and Face ID replacing Touch ID. Professional photographers, video editors, and digital artists justify Pro pricing through workflow advantages including ProRes video recording, LiDAR scanning, and reference-quality displays. <strong>But most users find the Air’s M3 chip provides more than adequate performance</strong> for typical tablet workflows and the $350+ savings compared to iPad Pro base models enables purchasing Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil accessories for instance.</p>
<p>The M3 chip made for Apple Intelligence has an <strong>8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU architecture</strong> that makes it almost as powerful as a desktop computer. When you edit videos in iMovie or LumaFusion, the effects happen in real time and the timeline scrubbing is smooth.</p>



<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display has a resolution of 2360 x 1640 at 264 PPI</strong> which makes individual pixels impossible to see. The P3 wide color gamut shows more colors than the standard sRGB display, and it makes colors that look washed out on other displays stand out more in photos and videos. The ultralow reflectivity coating keeps the screen visible outside where glossy screens wash out completely. The True Tone technology <strong>changes the white balance based on the lighting around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>
<p>Stage Manager is one of the features of iPadOS that makes real work possible: It <strong>lets you create resizable and overlapping app windows</strong> like those on desktop operating systems instead of forcing you to switch between apps in full screen. Support for external displays makes the workspace bigger by adding monitors, and Scribble turns handwriting into text wherever you can type.</p>
<p>At $449, the iPad Air 11-inch is the best value for money iPad you can get during Black Friday. If you need tablet computing with good performance, this record-low price makes Apple’s mainstream iPad accessible without compromise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-gave-up-on-fire-10-inch-hd-tablet-own-hardware-burned-with-zero-margin-2000648193</link>
            <guid>1366969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> packs a 10.1-inch Full HD display, octa-core processor with 3GB RAM and 13-hour battery life into a package that <strong>costs seven times less than entry-level iPads</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">At $69, down from $139, this tablet has become the #1 bestseller across Amazon’s entire computers and tablets category</a> while hitting a record-low price that makes it cheaper than many restaurant dinners. Amazon removes profit margins on own-brand hardware during Black Friday to drive Alexa and Fire OS adoption. The <strong>50% discount transforms tablets</strong> from considered purchases into impulse buys that justify owning multiple units for different family members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.1-inch screen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> which means that Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube look clear instead of blurry. Text stays clear while you read instead of making your eyes hurt by being fuzzy. Rich colors make photos, videos, and games come to life with levels of saturation that are as good as those of tablets that cost a lot more.</p>



<p>With an octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, <strong>this Fire HD 10 is 25% faster than previous generations</strong>. It can handle web browsing with multiple tabs, video streaming, and casual gaming without any lag. Kids use educational apps, parents watch cooking videos, and students read textbooks, and the tablet’s performance is always responsive, so it never feels like a limitation.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 13 hours which is enough for a few hours of streaming</strong> and browsing each day. This means you can go on weekend trips, long flights, or full days without worrying about running out of battery. The 32GB of base storage is enough for basic apps, downloaded videos, ebook librarie, and photos, so you don’t have to add more right away. The <strong>microSD slot can hold up to 1TB of extra storage</strong> for growing content libraries.</p>
<p>Parents can also set up <em>Amazon Kids</em> parental controls to make tablets safe for kids by filtering content, setting time limits, and choosing educational content. With easy-to-use controls, parents can limit access to apps and videos that are appropriate for their child’s age and stop them from making purchases or seeing inappropriate content.</p>
<p>At $69, this is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on its own brand on Black Friday. The combination of real Full HD quality, real performance improvements, and incredible durability at half the already-low retail price makes it a better deal than any other iPad competitor. The fact that this is the #1 best-selling item on all computers and tablets shows that buyers know a great deal when they see one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-stuck-with-too-many-airpods-pro-3-now-selling-newest-earbuds-at-all-time-low-to-clear-stock-2000648166</link>
            <guid>1366960</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year marks a turning point in Apple’s historically rigid pricing strategy where discounts remained rare and controlled. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">At $219, down from $249, the AirPods Pro 3 that launched just months ago join Apple’s unprecedented Black Friday selloff</a> happening exclusively on Amazon rather than through official channels.</p>
<p>The entire AirPods lineup received aggressive discounting including the <strong>AirPods Max at $399</strong>, <strong>AirPods 4 with ANC at $99</strong>, <strong>standard AirPods 4 at $69</strong>, and these flagship Pro 3 models. Apple appears determined to clear inventory quickly but discreetly through Amazon’s platform rather than diluting brand perception on their own website where premium pricing remains intact.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Live Translation That Lets You Talk to Anyone</h2>
<p>With<strong> the real-time translation feature</strong>, you can talk to people who don’t speak English face-to-face. The earbuds translate speech right away and show the text on your paired iPhone: Ordering food, asking for directions or doing business in a foreign language is less scary when AI can help with these things. The feature works for <strong>phone calls as well and translates both sides of conversations in real time</strong> for international calls with coworkers, family or business contacts who don’t speak your language.</p>



<p>The <strong>heart rate sensor turns AirPods from simple audio devices into health monitoring tools</strong> that can keep track of heart health metrics during workouts without the need for chest straps or wrist-worn devices. The optical sensors measure blood flow through the ear canals and send heart rate data to Apple Health so you can keep track of your fitness in real time.<strong> Runners can see their heart rate zones</strong> in real time while they train without having to wear an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The <strong>hearing aid feature is a huge step forward</strong> in accessibility because FDA-approved hearing aids can now work through regular earbuds instead of expensive medical devices. The feature runs built-in tests to figure out your hearing profile, then boosts certain frequencies where you have hearing loss while keeping the sound quality natural. People with mild to moderate hearing loss can get help with everyday tasks without the stigma or cost of traditional hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation works better</strong> now because the processing has been improved to sample background noise and make anti-phase sound waves that are more accurate. The noise of airplanes, people talking in the office and traffic all fade away into silence and let you fully concentrate on music, podcasts or work without any outside noise. The <strong>adaptive transparency mode</strong> lets in background noise when you need it for conversations or to be aware of your surroundings – and it changes automatically based on how loud the noise is around you.</p>
<p>With dynamic head tracking, <strong>Spatial Audio makes three-dimensional soundstages</strong> where sounds seem to come from certain places in space around you. Directional audio cues that put dialogue in the center of the screen and sound effects that pan left and right make movies and shows more immersive than flat stereo can. More and more music producers are using spatial audio which means that artists mix tracks specifically for this format to make immersive experiences where instruments are in different places.</p>
<p>If you want Apple’s most advanced earbuds, this record-low price represents the best value available.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-zero-profit-on-airpods-max-price-so-low-it-makes-you-forget-bose-and-sony-exist-2000648175</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon officially launched Black Friday last Thursday, November 20th, when the AirPods Max dropped from $549 to $479, surprising everyone since Apple rarely discounts premium products. This <strong>Thanksgiving Thursday brought an even more aggressive markdown</strong> as Amazon pushed these flagship noise-cancelling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">headphones down to $399, down from $549, representing nearly 30% immediate savings</a>.</p>
<p>At $399, these over-ear headphones have hit <strong>an unprecedented record-low price</strong> that shatters all previous discounting patterns for Apple’s premium audio hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise cancellation at the pro level</h2>
<p>The <strong>active noise cancellation can get rid of up to twice as much background noise as previous Apple models</strong>: This is because eight microphones work with the H1 chip to sample ambient sound and create precise anti-phase waves. The computer audio processing happens all the time, every microsecond and it changes to fit the noise level as you move from one place to another or as the sounds around you change.</p>



<p>The<strong> transparency mode lets ambient sound through with little processing latency</strong> which makes people more aware of their surroundings: This lets people talk without taking off their headphones or missing important environmental cues. The mode uses the same microphone array and computational audio pipeline as ANC to process outside sound which keeps the sound quality instead of just lowering the cancellation.</p>
<p>The iPhone’s <em>TrueDepth</em> camera scans your ears to figure out their shape, and then<strong> personalized spatial audio adjusts the sound delivery to fit your body</strong> so that you can hear it in the <strong>best three-dimensional way</strong>. Directional audio cues are great for movies and TV shows because they keep dialogue in the middle of the screen while sound effects move left and right, and this makes the experience much more immersive than flat stereo. <strong>Dynamic head tracking keeps the audio in the same place</strong> as your connected device so when you turn your head, the soundstage doesn’t change.</p>



<p>The acoustic-first design philosophy puts sound quality first by <strong>using custom 40mm dynamic drivers that give you high-fidelity audio</strong> across the entire frequency range. Deep bass reproduction goes all the way down to sub-bass frequencies without distortion. Midrange clarity makes sure that vocals and instruments sound natural instead of colored. Treble detail shows subtle differences in recordings that headphones that are compressed or poorly tuned hide.</p>
<p>The <strong>computational audio uses the H1 chip’s processing power</strong> and advanced algorithms that change the sound in real time based on how well it fits, how loud it is, and what type of content it is. The system keeps the sound balanced at any volume by changing the frequency response as you change the volume. It also makes up for changes in the seal as the cushions compress or move, and it processes music, movies, and podcasts differently based on their content.</p>
<p>When you<strong> integrate your ecosystem with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac</strong>, you get seamless experiences because your devices switch automatically and follow your attention without having to pair them manually. Start music on your iPhone while you’re on the bus, switch to your Mac for work without changing any settings, and then switch to your iPad for streaming in the evening: Your headphones will automatically connect to the devices that are currently in use.</p>
<p>If you want Apple’s best audio quality with unmatched noise cancellation, this record-low deal makes premium over-ear headphones accessible without the usual premium pricing.</p>

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’ve seen Sony’s DualSense Edge discounted on a few occasions this year, and now it’s back on sale ahead of Black Friday as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/824326/playstation-5-ps5-pro-black-friday-deal-sale-2025">Sony’s ongoing holiday promo</a>. Right now, you can snag the pro-style gamepad in either black or white at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSYFB99D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-for-ps5-pc-mac-mobile-white%2FJXHQ3CJ4RR%2Fsku%2F6532912" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for around $169 ($30 off), which is just $10 shy of its previous low. The black version of the DualSense Edge is seldom discounted by this much, so now’s a good time to pick one up if you prefer the stealthier look.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time gaming on the PlayStation 5, the DualSense Edge elevates the experience by offering more customization than Sony’s standard DualSense controller. For starters, its deep software integration with the PS5 lets you create up to four profiles, each with customization options for button mapping, stick sensitivity, and assigning commands to the rear buttons. You can create separate profiles for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>, for instance, and swap between them on the fly without having to leave your game.</p><p>In addition to custom profiles, the DualSense Edge lets you adjust the feel of the triggers (L2 and R2), so you can tailor them to specific play styles and games. You can set the triggers to be more sensitive for online shooters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or less sensitive for racing games to achieve smoother acceleration and braking. Moreover, the Edge makes it easy to swap out stick modules in case one stops working.</p><p>As much as we enjoy how much you can customize the DualSense Edge, though, it’s not without its faults. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">review</a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s Cameron Faulkner found that the controller averaged only about eight hours of battery life on a full charge, which is worse than the standard DualSense controller. It does, however, come with a long charging cable that can lock into the controller, preventing it from accidentally being yanked out.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/822252/sony-dualsense-edge-controller-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-forgot-how-math-works-15-6-512gb-laptop-drops-72-from-2k-to-almost-nothing-2000648161</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>HP keeps premium positioning in the Windows laptop segment where finding capable machines under $1,000 proves challenging, particularly on their official website where aggressive discounting rarely appears. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6024/">at $539, down from a typical $1,999, this 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop</a> featuring <strong>Intel’s 13th Gen i3-1315U processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and Windows 11 Pro</strong> has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6024/">crashed 73% below typical pricing</a> during Black Friday on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6024/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Can Handle Real Workloads</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Core i3-1315U processor has 6 cores</strong> that are split between performance and efficiency designs, and this hybrid architecture speeds up demanding tasks while keeping battery life. The performance cores take care of heavy tasks like video conferencing, photo editing, and data analysis while the efficiency cores take care of light tasks and background tasks without wasting power.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch HD touchscreen makes it easy to use Windows by letting you pinch, zoom, swipe, and tap</strong> to navigate – and it changes how you use the keyboard and trackpad. The touchscreen makes<strong> Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface elements</strong> even better: These elements are made for finger use, not mouse precision. The <strong>display has an 85% screen-to-body ratio</strong> which means that the bezels are very thin and the viewable area is as large as possible.</p>
<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM gets rid of memory bottlenecks that annoy people who use memory-heavy programs like virtual meetings, big spreadsheets, or a lot of professional software at once. This amount of memory<strong> lets you run Windows 11 Pro and a lot of productivity apps at the same time</strong>, do a lot of research in your browser, and keep your communication tools running without slowing down the system.</p>
<p>The 512GB SSD has enough space for the operating system, professional software suites, project files and media libraries, so you don’t have to rely on external drives all the time. The <strong>solid-state storage boots up in less than 15 seconds</strong> and opens applications in less than 10 seconds because NVMe speeds are faster than those of regular SATA drives. High-speed storage subsystems speed up the transfer of large files, the saving of video projects, and the operation of databases.</p>



<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro has business</strong> features that Windows Home editions don’t have like BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop and Active Directory support. The built-in Copilot AI assistant helps you come up with ideas, organize your tasks, write documents and answer questions in a way that feels natural. For tasks that need privacy, <strong>the AI runs on your computer</strong>.</p>
<p>HP’s premium brand quality combined with Amazon’s zero-margin Black Friday strategy creates exceptional value that rarely materializes on current-generation hardware. If you need capable daily computing without premium pricing, this record-low deal makes professional Windows laptops accessible.</p>

              <p>Philips Hue represents the premium brand in smart lighting where default pricing remains consistently high enough that shoppers wait specifically for Prime Day or Black Friday to make purchases.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/">At $69, down from $109 (36% off), this 3-pack of white and color smart bulbs</a> costs barely more than a <strong>single bulb at regular pricing which runs at $54</strong> <strong>individually</strong>. This record-low pricing transforms smart lighting from luxury upgrade into practical home improvement that justifies outfitting entire rooms or homes rather than installing single bulbs as experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 million colors that change the look of a room</h2>
<p>The white and color ambiance range lets you control the whole spectrum with <strong>millions of color combinations and white temperatures</strong> that can be changed from <strong>warm 2700K to cool 6500K</strong>. This flexibility lets you match the lighting to your activities, moods and times of day instead of being stuck with fixed color temperatures that make you compromise.</p>



<p>The<strong> 24-hour natural light scene changes its color temperature and brightness</strong> automatically during the day to match the patterns of sunlight. This keeps your circadian rhythm in sync which helps you sleep better and stay alert during the day. In the morning, the light slowly gets brighter, like the sun rising, instead of waking you up with a loud alarm. In the evening, the light slowly gets warmer and dimmer and signals that it’s time to go to bed.</p>
<p>With Hue Bridge integration, you can use advanced <strong>features like automation based on schedules or sensor triggers</strong>, remote control from anywhere with an internet connection, and rock-solid Zigbee connectivity that doesn’t slow down WiFi networks. The secure, dedicated wireless protocol stops the connection drops and delays that WiFi-based bulbs have when they are on busy home networks. <strong>Matter protocol support lets Philips products </strong>work with a wider range of smart home systems, making them compatible with other platforms and protecting investments from being locked into a single ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>Voice control with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri</strong> lets you use natural language commands to control things without having to touch anything. This is easier than navigating apps. This voice integration is especially useful when your hands are full cooking, carrying things or getting ready for bed and you don’t want to have to grab your phone.</p>
<p>Dynamic light effects <strong>make subtle animations like slow color changes, breathing pulses, or candlelight flickers</strong> that make the lighting more interesting than just being static. These effects turn regular rooms into lively spaces where lighting is more than just a tool. When combined with Hue Sync software, immersive effects that sync with on-screen action make gaming setups better.</p>
<p>These<strong> bulbs can be used as main light sources because they are bright enough (800 lumens) for general room lighting</strong>, not just accent lighting. The LED technology <strong>uses only 9 watts of power</strong> while giving off the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. This saves a lot of money on electricity over the 25,000-hour life of the bulb.</p>
<p>This three-for-one price makes it possible to buy premium smart lighting for whole rooms instead of just one bulb.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-dumps-thousands-of-irobot-vacuums-roomba-105-now-going-for-all-time-low-2000648154</link>
            <guid>1366909</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums span a massive price spectrum where premium models costing $1,000 to $2,000 deliver great performance across all metrics while budget options fluctuate wildly in quality and reliability. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">At $249, down from $449, the iRobot<em> Roomba 105</em> (with auto-empty dock) represents the sweet spot where proven brand reliability meets accessible pricing during Black Friday</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p>iRobot dominates the category through decades of refinement that established <strong>Roomba as the generic term for robot vacuums</strong>, similar to how Kleenex represents tissue. This r<strong>ecord-low deal includes the game-changing auto-empty dock</strong> that transforms occasional convenience into genuine hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>75-Day Self-Emptying That Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The auto-empty dock empties the robot’s dustbin automatically after each cleaning session, and it compresses the dirt into a <strong>big bag that needs to be changed about every 75 days in normal household conditions</strong>. This longer maintenance schedule turns robot vacuums from things that need to be cleaned every week into real <em>“set-and-forget”</em> cleaning tools that can run on their own for months.</p>



<p>The<strong> 70x power-lifting suction of the new Roomba 600 series creates real cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines and picks up fine dust particles from hardwood floors. This suction power is on par with that of upright vacuums and it comes from small robotic shapes. This means that robot vacuums can do the same job as traditional vacuums without needing to be used with them.</p>
<p>The <strong>three-stage cleaning system</strong> has a strong suction and a brush that works on both carpet and hard floors. It also has an edge-sweeping brush that pulls dirt out of corners and baseboards that the main brushes can’t reach.</p>
<p><em>ClearView</em><strong> LiDAR navigation maps your home</strong> by measuring distances with lasers, and this makes accurate floor plans that let you clean each room in a planned way instead of randomly bumping into things. The LiDAR sensor accurately measures how far away walls and other obstacles are, and this makes cleaning paths that cover the whole floor plan without missing any spots or having to clean the same areas over and over.</p>



<p>You can<strong> program certain rooms to be cleaned based on your daily schedule</strong> so you can focus on cleaning the areas where you actually live instead of spreading the battery evenly across the whole house: Plan to clean the kitchen after dinner, the bedroom before bed or the living room before guests arrive. You can change the cleaning passes and suction levels to fit the area: For example, you can use the most power on carpets that get a lot of traffic and save battery on areas that don’t get used as much</p>
<p>The <strong>iRobot Home app gives you full control over your robot</strong> and allows you to set up custom cleaning schedules, get time estimates for different tasks, keep an eye on the filter’s life, and set up virtual keep-out zones that stop the robot from going into certain areas. Without physical barriers getting in the way, you can make invisible walls around pet food bowls, fragile floor vases, or rooms that are being remodeled.</p>
<p>At $249, the iRobot Roomba 105 is at 45% below retail this Black Friday. If you want great hands-off floor cleaning with proven brand quality, this record-low price makes premium robotic cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-65-oled-s90f-tv-hits-all-time-low-2025-model-now-cheaper-than-last-years-version-2000648184</link>
            <guid>1366882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung committed fully to Black Friday by discounting every product category and Amazon delivering the most aggressive pricing across smartphones, tablets, earbuds, and TVs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/">At $1,397, down from $1,997 ($600 off)</a>, the <strong>65-inch OLED S90F featuring the NQ4 AI Gen3 processor, 4K AI upscaling, OLED HDR+, and 144Hz Motion Xcelerator</strong> is the pinnacle of Samsung’s display technology at a record-low price.</p>
<p>This deal applies across all size variants, though the <strong>65-inch model dominates sales</strong> through optimal balance between screen real estate and living room proportions. The 30% discount makes OLED technology accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier LED TVs just years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Neural Network Processing That Changes Content</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen3 processor uses 128 dedicated neural networks</strong> that have been trained on millions of images to look at content frame by frame and make smart improvements that make the picture quality much better. The AI can tell the difference between sports, movies, news, and games and then it processes each type of content in the best way for that type: Sports broadcasts get motion smoothing that cuts down on blur when the camera pans quickly; Movies keep the cinematic frame cadence without the soap opera effect that aggressive processing makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K AI upscaling uses the same neural network architecture</strong> to look at lower-resolution content and intelligently fill in missing details to make it look like it was shot in 4K. Cable broadcasts, streaming services that deliver 1080p and older content libraries all get sharper and clearer when you play them back because of edge enhancement, texture synthesis, and noise reduction. The upscaling is especially useful because the content mixes true 4K productions with upscaled or natively lower-resolution material, which keeps the visual quality the same no matter where it comes from.</p>
<p>OLED technology uses self-emissive pixels that <strong>turn completely off when showing black</strong> instead of backlights that leak through, and this gives you perfect blacks and infinite contrast. This basic benefit makes picture quality that LCD panels with local dimming can’t match: It shows shadow detail in dark scenes while keeping bright highlights without blooming or haloing. With HDR content, stars shine against really black space backgrounds, and horror movies show intentional shadow detail instead of washing everything gray.</p>



<p>Motion <em>Xcelerator</em> 144Hz makes motion look smooth by using high refresh rates and smart frame interpolation to cut down on judder and blur during fast action. VRR support <strong>up to 4K 144Hz is good for gaming</strong> because it stops screen tearing and keeps input lag low, which is important for competitive play. When cameras move quickly, sports broadcasts become clearer.</p>
<p>Samsung <em>Vision AI</em> uses scene-by-scene analysis to adjust brightness, contrast and color saturation based on the content and the lighting in the room. The system makes the screen brighter when you watch it during the day in bright rooms and less bright when you watch it at night to keep your eyes from getting tired. Dark scenes get targeted brightening that shows shadow detail without making the whole picture look washed out.</p>
<p>The full range of connections, such as HDMI 2.1 ports, USB inputs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, works with modern gaming consoles, streaming devices, sound systems, and wireless accessories without the need for adapter dongles or connection issues.</p>
<p>If you want the best picture quality Samsung produces, this record-low price makes flagship OLED TVs attainable without waiting years for depreciation.</p>

			<p>Another Black Friday, a whole new batch of deals for those patient players who were willing to wait for a good deal, and for Final Fantasy fans, or anyone wanting to see what all the fuss is about, that deal seems to be here. On Amazon, you can grab the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy (so far) for just $50.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade is the complete version of the beginning of this trilogy, including the base game and the Intergrade DLC expansion that Square Enix released for it post-launch. <a href="https://amzn.to/43TKIDV" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">You can grab it on PS5 right now on Amazon for only $20</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4pgPvHS" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">you can also grab it for PS5 on Amazon right now for only $30</a>. Some quick maths will tell you that for just $50, you can get the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, save for the third and final game in the trilogy, which Square Enix is still working on.</p>



<p>Development of which, according to Square Enix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">is coming along quite well</a>. It might still be a while until we find out more about the game, but it's good to hear positive updates from Square Enix on the game's progress.</p>

			<p>Today is Thanksgiving in the United States, which is particularly significant for Americans. For the rest of the world, though, it means that tomorrow is Black Friday, and along with that come scores of deals available globally that players outside of the US care about as well, like the fact that you can now grab one of the hottest shooters of 2025, Battlefield 6, for just $35.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-2025" rel="sponsored noopener">IGN</a>, this is arguably one of the best Black Friday deals available for recent 2025 releases, especially when you consider that Battlefield 6 only launched on October 10, and a little more than a month later, it is available for half off. It was available at Amazon, but it very quickly sold out. You can still grab it at GameStop, however.</p>



<p>Here's both links to grab it for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://fave.co/4okc0KQ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 PS5 - GameStop</a></li>



<li><a href="https://fave.co/4iJf56h" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 Xbox Series X/S - GameStop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is one deal you'll want to try and grab as quickly as possible, because it'll likely sell out or be removed before the weekend is up. It's an especially good deal if you've already been playing Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/">through the free trial currently ongoing this week</a>, because now you'll be able to continue the progress you've made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Nintendo Switch 2 Runs at 30FPS with NVIDIA DLSS and Baked GI]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Around a month ago, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows, the latest mainline entry in the publisher's biggest open world franchise, would release on Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. The game's engine, the latest version of Anvil, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured many big improvements</a>, ushering the franchise into the next generation with technologies like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive ray tracing effects (global illumination and reflections)</li>



<li>Dynamic wind and rain driven by fluid simulation that affect trees, foliage, leaves, and even rainfall direction</li>



<li>Physics‑based, procedural cloud and weather simulation that continually evolves cloudscapes</li>



<li>Nanite‑style micropolygon system that virtualizes geometry, letting the engine render extremely detailed terrain and assets while smoothly adjusting triangle density with distance</li>



<li>Expanded destruction physics and improved cloth and material interaction</li>



<li>Overhauled terrain and asset streaming built around the aforementioned virtualized geometry system, keeping dense villages and varied topography loaded without hammering CPU or storage bandwidth</li>



<li>Deeper integration of GPU instancing and mesh shaders to cut CPU submission overhead and render many small objects efficiently</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 platform, however, is far less powerful than the platforms on which the game was first released on (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). According to Ubisoft's Project Lead Programmer Bruno, the developers had to fundamentally redesign how the world is rendered and even how the game systems of Assassin's Creed Shadows interact with each other.</p>



<p>Core simulation systems like clouds and cloth are preserved but heavily optimized and sometimes downscaled to lower GPU load, while global illumination uses the baked solution already employed on low-spec PC and Xbox Series S to save RAM rather than relying <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the console's hardware ray tracing support</a> to deliver ray traced GI.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Ubisoft had to extensively tune down every parameter (LOD, draw distances, texture resolution, and object streaming) per scenario, reducing NPC counts only where necessary in dense hubs to uphold performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B011oT5j4iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The developers leveraged the Nintendo Switch 2's support of NVIDIA DLSS to reconstruct a sharp image from a lower resolution base, thus accelerating performance. Ultimately, however, Ubisoft settled on achieving a stable 30 frames per second in both handheld and docked modes. The difference, then, lies in the visual quality, which is further diminished in handheld mode, whereas docked mode offers improved image quality, increased draw distance, and more refined LOD settings.</p>



<p>The handheld mode does have a few tricks up its sleeve, such as HDR support and a tweaked implementation of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). Bruno explained:</p>



<p><em>The lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 FPS, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. We didn't want to compromise on that aspect, and so we built a dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 FPS, keeping the game as fluid and responsive as possible.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft is leveraging a few platform-specific features for this version of the game, such as touchscreen support for menus, maps, and hideout interactions. There are also plans for future mouse and keyboard compatibility in docked mode.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>On December 2, players won't be able to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-unremarkable-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, which is coming at some point in 2026 to the Nintendo Switch 2. On that note, Ubisoft also just <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that it'll be the only major expansion coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, unlike the previous entry, Valhalla, which got three (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids-of-politics-and-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrath of the Druids</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Siege of Paris</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-the-end-of-an-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of Ragnarök</a>).</p>

            <p>
If you've been patiently waiting for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, your time has nearly come: it slinks onto the console next Tuesday, 2nd December. And ahead of its arrival, Ubisoft has shared a bit of a deep-dive detailing some of the technical jiggery pokery it used to make it work on Nintendo's platform, alongside some of its exclusive features.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launched for other platforms back in March following a number of delays, whisking the series to 16th century feudal Japan for an adventure focused on dual protagonists Yasuke and Fujibayashi Naoe. It was well-received too, with Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips calling it "majestic in scope, impressive in detail" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">his four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the Switch 2 version, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">latest blog post</a> confirms it'll include all updates released for Assassin's Creed Shadows so far, with the exception of its Claws of Awaji expansion, which is due in 2026. The company also notes future Switch 2 updates will align with other platforms, and it'll be working on console-specific improvements too, with talk of optimisation patches plus keyboard and mouse compatibility when docked.

<p>
Wondering what else you can expect on Switch 2? Ubisoft is targeting a "stable 30fps" in both docked and handheld modes, saying it's done a "lot of code-level work... to optimise and adapt the game architecture". This, it adds, has enabled it to "streamline certain technical aspects of the quality, without compromising the player's experience or the richness of the game."
</p><p>
Elsewhere it's foregoing Switch 2's ray-traced global illumination support in favour of baked global illumination "mainly for RAM memory reasons", while level of details, draw distances, texture resolution, and element loading have been "carefully adjusted" in an effort to maintain performance. Switch 2 will also feature fewer NPCs in highly populated areas to "ensure smooth gameplay", although Ubisoft reckons environmental richness "remains largely intact". There's also DLSS support for "smoother" performance.
</p>
<p>
As for handheld mode compromises, there've been "adjustments to image quality, draw distance, and LOD settings" to accomodate GPU limitations. However, variable refresh rates make an appearance, as does HDR.
</p>
<p>
If it's Switch 2-specific features you want, there's touch screen navigation when interacting with maps and menus. Additionally, cross-progression is supported via Ubisoft Connect, meaning it's possible to seamlessly hop between platforms if you've been playing - or were planning on playing - Shadows elsewhere. And as a reminder, Assassin's Creed Shadows arrives on Switch 2, next Tuesday, 2nd December.

With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp;</p><p>So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there's any pressure involved, and more. Here's what I learned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here," Yagi tells me. "I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes." Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn't feel much pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. [...] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.”</p><p>When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it's a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">you can read about that here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep," Ichikawa says. "When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII's story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters [...] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake."&nbsp;</p><p>Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, "Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?" while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>I won't spoil anything here, but if you're familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it's just too essential for the story," Yagi says. "There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it's not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking more broadly, Yagi says the team behind Reimagined "really wanted to make the overall game experience more immersive for our players [and that's why we streamlined the story. It's also why we made some adjustments to the combat."</p><p>Closing out our conversation on the philosophy behind this remake, Ichikawa tells me, "Reimagined" implies everything is new. He says, "We really built everything from the ground up. We rebuilt everything, aside from the scenario, from scratch. In order to convey that sentiment, we felt that 'Reimagined' would be the most adequate title instead of 'Remake.'"</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/27/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-producer-and-director-on-remaking-a]]></content:encoded>
