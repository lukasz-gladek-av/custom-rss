<p>The team behind Omelet You Cook, a cooking roguelike, is worried about the release of Slay the Spire 2, which could take away all the buzz the game could have.</p>



<p>Roguelike games are plentiful in 2026, but Slay the Spire arguably stands head and shoulders above the rest in the genre. Omelet You Cook, published by SchuBox Games, offers a unique take on the genre and is currently available on Steam Early Access. However, it’s scheduled to leave early access on February 8, giving the game only one month before Slay the Spire’s long-awaited sequel comes out and dominates the roguelike discussion.</p>







<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-hits-early-access-in-march-2026">Slay the Spire 2 hits Early Access in March 2026</h2>



<p>In September 2025, Mega Crit announced that the sequel to the massively popular 2019 roguelike deck builder would be hitting Early Access in March, following a delay. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+, </a>Dan Schumacher noted that they originally assumed they would not have to compete with the massive title because they believed it was still set to release in late 2025. </p>



<p>However, as it turns out, they missed the delay announcement. Schumacher even joked that he won’t have time to finish his own game because he’ll be too busy playing that</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There was no way we could release at the same time as an absolute juggernaut in our own genre,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He encourages audiences to be kind to the title as it leaves early access in February, noting that it’s a big jump, but they want the chance to have a wider audience play the game.</p>







<p>You can pick up Omelet You Cook right now on Steam and Early Access for $15. There’s a free demo, as well.</p>

With a vibrant aesthetic that aims to recreate the richness and dynamism of hand-drawn Japanese animation, <em>Homura Hime</em> tasks players with ridding the world of the fiendish Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, utilizing slick melee combat evocative of the <em><a title="Series > NieR [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/nier">NieR</a></em> and <em>Devil May Cry</em> series. Dodge the barrages of enemy attacks and string together flashy combos to clear the battlefield, excising tainted souls from a troubled world and unraveling the mysterious legacy of the titular heroine.</p><p>Welcome to a world populated by both humans and demons. Here, troubled souls burdened by intense emotion or deep regret are transformed into archdemons when they pass through the veil of mortality. These archdemons have the power to corrupt the very foundation of the world, contaminating their surroundings and the creatures who dwell within them. Those tainted by this demonic power turn into lowly monsters; vicious fiends that operate solely on raw instinct. When this world becomes threatened by a quintet of extremely powerful Archdemon Girls, the High Priestess has no other choice but to turn to Homura Hime, the “Flame Princess” and the strongest exorcist. Alongside her devoted aide Ann, Homura Hime must embark on a divine mission to eliminate the five Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, banishing their evil and purifying her discordant world.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022093"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

Bobcat as he solves crimes in Toontown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a bundle fit for the biggest fans of classic gaming from the House of Mouse, with the total game count now reaching eight. The February re-release will finally bring the bundle to Nintendo’s hybrid consoles, with access to soundtracks, a behind-the-scenes gallery, and rewind features, available, too. There are also Time Attack and Boss Rush modes for those looking to shake up that classic gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Disney Afternoon Collection physical edition is also confirmed to be in development for those willing to wait until after the February digital release. Disney says the physical Switch release – which comes with the game cartridge, two sticker sheets, eight retro milk caps, and three collectible cards – is now available for pre-order and will ship “at a later date.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Disney Afternoon Collection Nintendo Switch Announcement Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Disney Afternoon Collection launches digitally next month.

			<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>, the mistake you may make is treating the Samurai and Ninja styles as a binary choice, picking whichever you feel is best in each situation. And you wouldn't be terribly wrong: both styles are perfectly viable on their own and there is no direct penalty for staying in one all the time.</p>



<p>However, if you do that, you are limiting your potential. Switching between the two styles is the essential "next step" in the combat dance that the <em>Nioh</em> series has always championed. </p>



<p>Welcome to the Dojo. In this guide, we will go over some of the game's central combat mechanics, such as Arts Proficiency, and how they come together to dictate a very unique combat flow.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-why-ki-damage-matters" data-level="2">Why Ki Damage Matters</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-challenge-of-style-differences" data-level="2">The Challenge of Style Differences</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency" data-level="2">The Power of Arts Proficiency</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled" data-level="2">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-why-ki-damage-matters">Why Ki Damage Matters</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Ki-Damage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The key to combat in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> remains the same as in previous entries: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">depleting enemy Ki</strong>. By doing so, you gain a massive advantage over enemies, no matter their type.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human Enemies:</strong> Once their Ki is gone, they are open to grapple attacks.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai:</strong> Lowering their Ki allows you to stagger them with any attack, and reducing their Max Ki opens them up to a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Blow</strong> for massive damage.</li>
</ul>



<p>While you can mostly ignore these mechanics for the majority of regular enemies during your first playthrough, dealing Ki damage is non-negotiable for bosses. It is the only way to deal high damage without them constantly retaliating and interrupting you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge-of-style-differences">The Challenge of Style Differences</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Styles-2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, depleting Ki has become slightly more challenging. Samurai Style attacks are generally slower than in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, and the primary Ki-destroying weapon, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tonfa</strong>, now exclusive to the Ninja Style.</p>



<p>Because of the sheer attack speed, the Ninja Style is naturally better at chipping away an enemy's Ki through a constant barrage of strikes, regardless of the equipped weapons. This quick pace serves a second purpose as well: building <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arts Proficiency</strong> much faster.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency">The Power of Arts Proficiency</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Arts-Proficiency-Full-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arts Proficiency is the mechanic in Nioh 3 that allows you to deal boss-melting damage, not counting Living Artifact, which can still take advantage of it to utterly annihilate most enemies. </p>



<p>As you attack in either style, you fill the Arts Proficiency gauge. Once filled, your next Martial Art or Heavy Attack is significantly powered up. In addition, the more different attacks you chain together while the gauge is active, the more powerful each one becomes.</p>



<p>At this point, you can easily understand how Ki depletion and Arts Proficiency in Ninja Style start building a basic combat flow. If a Yokai isn't out of Ki, it isn't staggered by your combo, and they can and will interrupt you. Unless you equip the  Oprresive Strength Samurai skill, but that opens up a survivability problem that can only be solved with advanced builds providing automatic healing by landing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Flow-Distilled-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With all the above in mind, the basic Nioh 3 combat loop can be distilled as such:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Pressure With Ninja Style:</strong> Start the fight in Ninja Style to deplete the enemy's Ki and rapidly build your Arts Proficiency gauge.</li>

<p>As you progress and gain a deeper understanding of these mechanics, you won’t need such a rigid structure. You'll find yourself switching styles instinctively based on the rhythm of the duel. However, for those first few hours in the Warring States, this loop is highly recommended to help you mow down Yokai and build the confidence required to become the next Shogun.</p>

<p>As such, the first few enemies of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Warring States</strong> starting map feel more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">challenging than they should</strong>.

<p>If the complexity of the Samurai stances feels like too much at the start, don't be afraid to lean on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong>. It deals less raw damage but offers a simplified basic moveset and superior agility that works against almost every enemy type while you learn the ropes.</p>

<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ki Pulse</strong> remains the most important mechanic in the franchise.

<p>Watch the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">light particles</strong> surrounding Takechiyo, as they indicate the perfect window. While a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Perfect Ki Pulse</strong> (timed to the last possible second) is the goal, don't stress about perfection early on. Just get used to the "hit-and-pulse" rhythm that defines the <em>Nioh</em> series combat.</p>



<p>As you get more used to Ki Pulsing, you will be able to take advantage of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flux</strong> ability (1 Samurai skill point in the Samurai Skill tree).

<p>The only metric that truly matters is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Agility</strong>, determined by your <strong>Current Encumbrance Ratio</strong>:</p>

<p>In <em>Nioh 3</em>, however, the introduction of <strong>Ninja</strong> style made <strong>dodging a valuable defensive option</strong>, more than in its predecessors, with an <strong>increased distance</strong> and the ability to dodge quickly after attacking with <strong>Mist</strong>, the Ninja style equivalent of <strong>Ki Pulse</strong> (but without Ki restoration!).</p>



<p>At the start of the game, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">mastering the nuances of both styles can be a challenge</strong>. Guarding, however, is a solid defensive option for both styles, so use the protection granted by this technique to learn how enemies attack, and so when you can use the Ninja style's superior agility to dodge when required.</p>

<p><em>This tip is more about improving your enjoyment of the game, rather than learning how to play. </em></p>



<p>The new open-field maps in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> make exploration highly rewarding.

Exploring also unlocks <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Battle Scrolls</strong>, which grant access to "compact" Nioh-style sub-missions and formidable elite enemies.</p>



<p>However, <strong>don't overdo it.</strong> If you clear every single icon before moving the story forward, you risk out-leveling the content and stripping away the challenge.</p>



<p>Play naturally and follow what interests you rather than chasing every waymarker. Remember that in a Team NINJA game, <strong>the first playthrough is essentially the tutorial</strong>, so you’ll have plenty of time to explore every inch of the map once the real game begins in the higher difficulty unlocked after completing the game for the first time.</p>

			<p><em><strong>Nioh 3</strong></em> is the first new entry in the hardcore action role-playing game series by Team NINJA in over 6 years, and a lot has changed since the second entry.</p>



<p>While the <strong>basic combat mechanics and loot system are rooted in the franchise's history</strong>, the third entry introduces <strong>many changes and additions</strong> that can leave even veterans a little confused.</p>



<p>In this&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Complete Walkthrough and Guides Hub</strong>, you will find everything you need not only to successfully complete your journey through time but also to have tons of fun while doing so, starting from the <strong>Warring States period</strong>, which can be experienced in the massive <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/">free demo</a></strong> available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p><span>Besides featuring another story which sees the appearances of real-history figures like Ieyasu Tokugawa,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;features a&nbsp;<strong>combination of old and new mechanics</strong></span>&nbsp;that enhance the series' challenging experience, but that may take <strong>some time to get used to</strong>, especially if you're coming straight from previous entries in the series.</p>



<p id="h-if-you-re-feeling-lost-in-this-sprawling-adventure-our-essential-tips-guide-will-help-you-come-to-grips-with-the-most-important-mechanics-in-the-game-and-start-having-fun-right-from-the-get-go">If you're feeling lost in this sprawling adventure, our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-5-essential-tips-to-learn-nioh-3/">Essential Tips guide</a></strong> will help you come to grips with the most important mechanics in the game and <strong>start having fun right from the get-go.</strong></p>

<p>Unlike previous entries in the series, which had players pick missions from several regional maps, <em>Nioh 3</em> features <strong>multiple open-field maps</strong> that let you explore different locations and reach the <strong>main mission locations</strong> directly while engaging in plenty of side content.</p>



<p>At end of these, which play like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">classic closed-off missions</strong> from previous entries in the series, you will have to defeat the <strong>fearsome bosses</strong> to destroy the <strong>Crucible</strong> and progress the story. This will unlock <strong>new regions of the open-field maps and brand-new maps.</strong></p>



<p>Even before the first Warring States period map opens up, you will have to contend with <strong>powerful bosses</strong> that can be frustrating to take down.

<p>The most significant change to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>'s combat system, aside from the ability to jump and briefly engage in aerial combat, is the introduction of two fighting styles: <strong>Samurai and Ninja.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Samurai Style</strong> plays like the characters from the first two entries in the series, allowing players to wield select weapons in <strong>three different stances</strong> and unleash powerful <strong>Martial Arts,</strong> which can be enhanced with the <strong>Arts Proficiency</strong> system.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong>, on the other hand, is a faster combat style that can use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninjutsu skills</strong> to disrupt enemies, deal elemental damage, and avoid enemy attacks with <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">superior agility.</strong></p>



<p>Both fighting styles can also be further empowered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Guardian Spirits</strong>, which grant access to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">two</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">elemental skills</strong> each that replace the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Yokai Skills</strong> from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em> and the powered-up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Living Artifact</strong> state, which replaces Living Weapon from the original <em>Nioh</em> and Yokai Shift from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>.</p>



<p>In case you are feeling <strong>confused</strong> about the <em>Nioh 3</em> <strong>combat flow</strong> amidst Samurai Style with its three stances and Ninja Style, you are not alone. <span>T</span>o learn the basics of this flow and how Arts Proficiency and Ninjustsu tie the two styles together, check out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">Mastering Nioh 3 Combat and Arts Proficiency Flow guide.</a></strong></p>

<p>Likewise, returning from its predecessors are <strong>multiple Skill Trees</strong> for the Samurai and Ninja Styles and all weapons, which can be used to unlock the <strong>Martial Arts</strong> that define each weapon and style.</p>



<p>New to the <em>Nioh</em> series are <strong>Skills and the Skill Points </strong>required to activate them. Learned by completing specific tasks, these skills <strong>empower</strong> both the Samurai and Ninja Style and provide bonuses for both.</p>



<p>Rounding up the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> character progression mechanics are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Soul Cores</strong>.

<p>Doing away with the classic linear design of the previous entries in the series, <em>Nioh 3</em> introduces <strong>open fields</strong> that replace the top-down maps of its predecessors. These maps are filled with <strong>side content</strong> to complete, including the Myth sidequests, formidable enemies, Crucible Wraiths and tons of treasure.</p>



<p>While traversal is always conducted on foot, you will unlock <strong>new traversal skills</strong> as more Guardian Spirits join you. They will also provide you with the power needed to unlock new areas and take advantage of the <strong>Spirit Veins</strong> to reach previously inaccessible areas.</p>

<p>The <strong>Diablo-style loot system</strong> returns in <em>Nioh 3.</em> By exploring the open fields and defeating both humans and Yokai, you will be able to find all <strong>sorts of loot</strong> ranging from Samurai and Ninja weapons to helmets, armor, gauntlets, graves, and accessories, coming in <strong>four rarity levels</strong> which determine how many passive skills they grant once equipped.</p>



<p>After reaching a certain point in the story, you will also unlock the <strong>Blacksmith</strong>, who will forge you weapons depending on the Smithing Texts you have found and customize them in different ways.</p>

<p>The asymmetrical mechanics have been further expanded in <em>Nioh 3</em> by introducing the <strong>Bloodedge Demon</strong>, a malignant Yokai that gathers the spirits of defeated Revenants appearing in different places all over the open-field maps.</p>

              <p>The current YouTube thumbnail meta requires people to pose extravagant claims or make dramatic declarations alongside exaggerated facial expressions of shock or skepticism. It’s <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/mind-the-curiosity-gap-how-can-upworthy-be-noble-and-right-when-its-clickbait-headlines-feel-so-wrong">curiosity gap</a> farming on steroids, increasingly aided by genAI to flood the platform with absurd content. BabyTuber thumbnails are the antidote.</p> <p>An artist who goes by Jamie on Bluesky shared the first one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l">earlier this week</a>. It was titled “Why I’m Switching” and showed an infant furrowing its brow while pondering upgrading from toy blocks to a bead maze. There’s a thought bubble, a greater than sign, and a question mark. It’s perfect.</p>   <p>Jamie encouraged others to get in on the fun and share their own Babytuber thumbnails. Some people did. They are also perfect.</p>   <figure id="attachment_2000663921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663921"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663921">pikuselu.gay</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663922">‪@wimbostratus.bsky.social‬Follow</figcaption></figure>   <figure id="attachment_2000663923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663923">misguidedlavender.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663924">athenap.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663925">nishbae.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663926" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663926"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663926">kinbassar.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <p>“At the end of the day it’s been fun to see people enjoying it, especially in a time where [every] headline online has been miserable,” Jamie <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-new-baby-youtuber-thumbnail-meta-changes-everything/">told <em>Aftermath</em></a>. “If this silly thing was able to brighten people’s day at all then I’m happy.

<p>Group SNE is adapting another video game into a tabletop RPG. This time, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/fromsoftware/" id="87617">FromSoftware’s</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign/" id="2260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign.</a></p>



<p>Group SNE has adopted many games for tabletop RPGs, including Armored Core 6, Dark Souls, and the original Elden Ring. The next TTRPG is scheduled for release in the spring of 2026. Elden Ring Nightreign is a twist on the original Elden Ring concept, turning the game into a three-player co-op game.</p>

<p>In December 2025, The Forsaken Hollows DLC launched for Nightreign. That DLC launched two new character classes, new bosses, and more. So far, the game has sold over 5 million units, and the DLC has also secured millions of sales.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has struggled a touch with its endgame pretty much since launch, but with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO's</a> next big update, Chapter 3, is promising to offer a revamp that you (yes, you! The person playing Dune: Awakening right now! Maybe!) have been after. A release date was also offered up for the big update, alongside some specifics on just what this new endgame might look like.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 is apparently set to arrive as soon as next week, February 3rd, so you've not got all that long to wait. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/541129246577262618">blog post</a> over on Steam, Funcom explained that the biggest bits of feedback regarding the endgame included the desire for more options, more rewarding ways to play, more things to do, more ways to progress player characters, and other bits, all of which will apparently be addressed in the update.
</p>
<p>
For starters, after you reach Plastanium (Tier 6), there'll be "deeper choices, shared goals, and more ways for players to continue growing." The new Specialization and Augmentation systems should allow for more in-depth progression, and there'll be 10 new locations to explore on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overland">Overland</a> Map, "including unique repeatable testing stations that feature challenging boss encounters with scaling difficulty and increasingly valuable loot."
</p>
<p>
Quite amusingly, you will also not have to pay taxes for your bases anymore! All because nobody liked it, which shows you that if we really wanted to, we could all stop paying our actual taxes too (Mr. Government I'm just goofing around, I promise). Those of you that haven't logged in in more than 28 days will also get a return package with some helpful tools too. Whether any of this is enough to bring people back or keep people happy, who knows! We'll find out soon enough in the Switter replies, I'm sure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The decline in Xbox hardware revenue has become so predictable you could <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-bethesda-xbox-game-pass-watch-special-edition-1850527638">set your <em>Starfield</em> watch to it</a>. Microsoft reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and, yes, console sales are down yet again. But the rest of the gaming division didn’t have a such a hot holiday either. The company is blaming year-over-year declines on the lack of strong releases near the end of 2025. Hmmm.</p> <p>“Xbox content and services revenue declined 5 percent (down 6 percent CC) on a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party content performance,” reads the company’s <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/141/SlidesFY26Q2.pptx">latest earnings presentation</a>. “Xbox hardware revenue declined 32 percent.”</p>

 <p>But last year’s numbers weren’t exactly stellar. The gaming division <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-revenue-fell-7-in-q2-as-hardware-sales-dropped-29/">saw a 7 percent decline</a> overall in the second quarter. Xbox hardware was down 29 percent this time in 2025, while content and services were only up 2 percent. Holiday 2024 had <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> but was otherwise quiet.</p> <p>Holiday 2025, on the other hand, saw the release of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, while<em> Flight Sim</em> came to PS5. Also the underperforming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which, combined with a major Game Pass price hike, might have led to a spike in churn. We don’t know, though, because Microsoft still isn’t releasing new subscriber numbers.</p>

 <p>All we know for sure is that the Xbox Series X/S is an ever-shrinking part of the equation for Microsoft Gaming and the company in general. And it’s been that way <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665">almost every year</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ps5-sales-exclusivity-starfield-microsoft-1851436748">since the consoles launched</a>. The company has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-backwards-compatibility-microsoft-pc-2000644836">new hardware</a> but the priorities of the evolving Xbox platform seem to increasingly lie beyond it.</p>

 <p>With the AI arms race led by Microsoft and others spiking <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">gaming hardware costs in the near term</a>, maybe that’s for the best.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/2k-christoph-hartmann-amazon-studios-crucible-2000663900</link>
            <guid>1419112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss of Amazon Game Studios is out. VP Christoph Hartmann is leaving the company according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdisznjdh22x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>. It’s another big blow to another tech giant that once had <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-mmo-servers-rust-facepunch-amazon-2000660558">big ambitions for gaming</a>.</p> <p>Hartmann was a cofounder of 2K Games and served as the <em>BioShock</em> and <em>Borderlands</em> publisher’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">president up until he left in 2017</a>. He joined Amazon a year later to lead a range of studios working on games like the MMO <em>New World</em>, which is now set to go offline in January 2027.</p> <p>“Gaming, today’s favorite form of entertainment in the world, is connecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hartmann said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-2k-games-president-christoph-hartmann-joins-amazon-games">when joining Amazon back in 2018</a>. “Between the teams at AGS, the incredible tools and technology from AWS, the global communities of Twitch and Twitch Prime, and all of the other assets around Amazon, there are few companies in the world set up to take gaming to the next level.”</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, Amazon never managed to bring those tools together, or the other resources at its disposal, to deliver a lasting hit in the ultra-competitive gaming space. One of its projects was a 2020 hero shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazons-crucible-flopped-so-hard-its-being-un-released-1844222299">by Relentless Studios called<em> Crucible</em></a>. If you don’t remember it, that’s because a few months after its release it was “unreleased,” and eventually canceled.</p> <p>Amazon signaled it was shifting away from AAA game development last fall amid massive cuts across the company. It still hasn’t confirmed the status of a previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a>, though one of its developers said <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-lord-rings-mmo-resident-evil-switch-2-pro-controller-2000640104">the team working on it was also laid off</a>, and remains slated to publish the upcoming<em> Tomb Raider</em> games, including this year’s reboot of the original.</p>

 <p>But to the extent that Amazon is still meaningfully invested in gaming, it seems to be mostly focused on its cloud gaming platform Luna. It shifted gears last fall to focus on party games like a courtroom comedy <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-failed-game-streaming-service-luna-pivots-snoop-dogg-ai-2000630696">featuring an AI Snoop Dogg</a>. Hartmann and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft had another big quarter on paper. Xbox, however, did not.</p>



<p>In its second quarter fiscal year 2026 (FY26 Q2) earnings report, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft announced</a> a 17% year-over-over jump in revenue to <strong>$81.3 billion</strong>, with growth once again driven by cloud and AI. Microsoft Cloud revenue hit <strong>$51.5 billion</strong>, Azure jumped <strong>39%</strong>, and most of the company’s major business lines continued to trend in the right direction.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> was the clear exception.</p>







<h2 id="h-xbox-revenue-fell-across-the-board">Xbox Revenue Fell Across The Board</h2>



<p>Within Microsoft’s report, the company said that Xbox content and services revenue <strong>fell 5% year over year</strong>. Microsoft didn’t disclose specifics on the Xbox content regarding the revenue for services like Xbox Game Pass, but did say that the decline can be attributed to last year benefiting from “strong first-party content performance”. Still, the slowdown is hard to overlook as Xbox content growth continues to cool, at least for the time being. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-tops-ps5-to-lead-hardware-sales-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardware</a> was an even bigger concern.</p>



<p>Microsoft confirmed that <strong>Xbox hardware revenue dropped 32%</strong> during the quarter. As usual, the company did not provide console sales numbers or much added context, but the direction is clear. Xbox console sales continue to slide, even as Microsoft positions the brand as more of a service-driven ecosystem than a traditional hardware platform.</p>







<p>Recent quarterly data shows how quickly things have changed. Xbox content and services revenue <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-revenue-q1-2026-drop-113m-year-over-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted strong gains throughout much of FY25</a>, including multiple quarters of double-digit growth. That momentum has now faded, with FY26 Q2 marking a shift into negative territory.</p>



<p>Despite the Xbox decline for the quarter, other parts of the earnings helped soften the impact. <strong>Windows OEM and Devices revenue grew 1%</strong>, while <strong>search and news advertising rose 10%</strong>, underlining just how much Xbox is lagging behind Microsoft’s other consumer-facing businesses.</p>



<p>For Microsoft, the overall earnings picture remains strong. For Xbox, the concerns are piling up. With hardware revenue falling sharply as the Xbox Series X|S ages out and content growth seemingly slowing, Microsoft’s long-term plan for the platform is becoming a bit murkier. </p>

			<p>After <strong>Amazon</strong> went through a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">mass layoff in October 2025</a></strong>, which saw <strong>14,000+ people lose their jobs</strong>, and resulted in significant cuts to <strong>Amazon Game Studios (AGS)</strong> with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-delisted-go-offline-january-2027-amazon-game-studios/">shuttering of <strong>New World Aeternum</strong></a> and the cancellation of an upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">Lord of the Rings MMO</a></strong>, the company has confirmed it will suffer yet another mass layoff, with <strong>16,000+ people</strong> being cut this time. While it's unclear if AGS is getting hit again, a new Bloomberg report indicates that the head of AGS, <strong>Christoph Hartmann</strong>, has left the company.</p>



<p>The layoff, first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/">Reuters</a>, is said to be impacting Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and human resources divisions, and not AGS. It's also reportedly a result of Amazon leaning further towards AI technology in an attempt to push for more efficiency.</p>



<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news in a short post on his personal Bluesky account, noting it as yet another indication of Amazon moving away from its previous strategy of developing and publishing PC and console games and shifting its focus towards cloud services like <strong>Amazon Luna</strong>.</p>







<p>Hartmann has yet to directly acknowledge his departure, though the wording from Schreier's post does seem to indicate that he made the decision to leave amidst the restructuring, rather than being laid off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-founder-amazon-game-studios/">Hartmann initially joined AGS in 2018</a> and led the division throughout his tenure with the company.</p>



<p>Prior to joining Amazon, he was the founder of <strong>2K Games</strong>, making his move to join Amazon when he did a significant sign that the company was trying to acquire top industry leaders with proven success records to build this new chapter for the company, and help pave their path into the video game industry.</p>



<p>Now, nearly eight years later, it seems like Amazon has a very different plan for how it wants its presence to be felt in video games. Back in October 2025, at the beginning of the month and ahead of its last mass layoff being announced, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/">the company revealed a refresh for its Amazon Luna cloud services, even calling it a <strong>"<em>re-launch</em>,"</strong></a> as it would begin to offer an original collection of AI-powered games along with popular third-party titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>
A thing that was quite endearing, perhaps the main appeal even, about the early internet was how it was a place you could go to, with lots of other, unique places to go through, be they forums, chatrooms, or oddball social games. The last item in the list there kind of faded away for a while, replaced by MMOs and live service games like Fortnite, but these smaller scale, social-first games, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-is-a-hangout-game">hangout games</a>, are making a comeback, with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a>. And soon, for the more aquatic amongst you, there will be Coral Social Club.
</p>
<p>
On its surface (pun very much intended), Coral Social Club certainly looks like a Webfishing-esque game where simply hanging out is the main goal, with a few fun things to do along the way. It's even fish oriented! Or I guess mermaid oriented, you're a mermaid, not a fish (I do not want to get into whether a mermaid is a fish or not). In it, you can design how your merperson looks, and the main goal is to just swim about, hang out with or make friends, and sing to rescue lost fish. Which in a way is also fishing, just without the violence aspect.

<p>
That's all that's really been announced so far, apart from the fact you can blow bubbles which is cute. The main thing that I'm coming away with from this reveal is how alongside the trend of more involved affordable hangout games like Peak or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, is that there are these similarly cheap games that are even more about hanging out than the others. Webfishing, this, the recently released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3707400/OnTogether_Virtual_CoWorking/">On-Together: Virtual Co-Working</a> which is literally a game designed to be a digital social hub you hangout in while you work.
</p><p>
It feels like an interesting counter to the more dominant world of live service, which similarly has many games that could be deemed hangoutable. And it isn't lost on me that such games continue to be popular with young people in a post-lockdown world. I'm certainly curious to see where we get to hangout next! I request space, prospective video game developer. I'd like to just hang out on an asteroid, or the sun perhaps (please also provide digital sunglasses, please and thank you). You can wishlist Coral Social Club on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4321890/Coral_Social_Club/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Farming is great, but what if you also want to grind through action-RPG dungeons for cool loot? </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2295170/Emberville/"><i><span>Emberville</span></i></a><span> is seemingly the answer. The upcoming life sim is pitched as a cross between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><i> </i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392"><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i></a>. A new look at gameplay makes the formula seem pretty compelling.</p> <p><span>Earlier this week, indie studio Cygnus Cross shared the official announcement trailer for </span><i><span>Emberville</span></i><span>, which is now slated to launch in early access this summer. The announcement came alongside the reveal of some of its star-studded voice cast, which is especially exciting considering the fact that it’s a pixel art indie game. </span></p>

 <p><span>Doug Cockle (best known as Geralt from </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span>)</span><span> and Alex Jordan (who can be heard as Mr. Hands in </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>)</span><span> are on board, with Jordan also serving as the voice director. In a press release, the team also teased that it’ll be revealing a “literal all-star cast” over the next few months, which is a big promise to make after already having Geralt himself on board.</span></p>  <p><span>While </span><i><span>Emberville </span></i><span>was quietly revealed back in 2023, this week’s trailer is being called the “official” announcement. The game is set in a prison of sorts called the Vitromotus, which appears to consist of a foggy, desolate town paired with more traditional dungeon-esque areas built for combat. There’s also a…very foreboding vibe going on in the trailer (the narration promises that there will be </span><span>many</span><span> challenges).</span></p>

 <p><span>While I’m guessing that the creepier tone will persist throughout the game’s combat segments, the player’s goal is to rebuild the town through the classic life-sim gameplay elements: farming, fishing, and befriending townspeople. The trailer shows off how the town starts to take on more of a bright, classic farming sim atmosphere as you progress.</span></p>

 <p><span>At the same time, the combat system also looks pretty fleshed out. There are “challenging” bosses, a dynamic HUD that adapts to different encounters, and a skill tree where earned perks can be inherited between classes. It seems like customization is really key here, whether it’s through designing a homestead or improving the main character’s stats and abilities.</span></p> <p><span>As a </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> freak who has always wished the game had a more in-depth combat system, I’m looking forward to checking out <em>Emberville</em> (and finding out who else could possibly be part of that already wild voice cast). It’s currently slated to come to PC sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says</link>
            <guid>1419091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, the superhero workplace comedy made by Telltale veterans at AdHoc Studio, is out now on Nintendo Switch. But a number of excited new and returning players aren't super happy about the release, as it turns out the game has been pretty aggressively censored on the system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been well-known since its release on other platforms that Dispatch is a game with signficant adult content. Some characters are fully or partially naked in various scenes, with their full anatomy on display. There are some sex scenes where characters make sounds associated with sex. Sometimes characters flip the bird at one another. For those who don't want to see all this, there's a censorship toggle in the settings that covers up the nudity and the middle fingers, and silences any unwanted sex noises. On most platforms, this is entirely optional and up to the player to turn on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But not on Nintendo Switch. Earlier today, reports began to drop from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewers of the Switch version</a> that Dispatch's censorship toggle is missing from the options on the platform. That's because it's permanently turned on (no pun intended). So all the censor bars and silence are just stuck that way, with no way to turn on the more mature version of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? According to AdHoc, it's because of Nintendo policies. "Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually," the studio said in a statement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared with Eurogamer</a>. "We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has understandably frustrated some people. A number of members of Dispatch online communities in places like Reddit and other social platforms have alternatingly expressed frustration with Nintendo for its policies, and AdHoc for bending to them so readily. While it's true that other games in the past such as, notably, Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE and Fire Emblem Fates, have also been censored in various ways. But by comparison, Dispatch's censorship is extremely blunt and distracting. Who wants giant black bars across the screen? Especially if you can't turn them off?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dispatch Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more, as some have pointed out, both Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3 are on Switch too. Both of those games have nudity, and neither has been censored in such a way, leading to questions about what makes Dispatch different. We're reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch is amazing, as we determined in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review">9/10 review of the game,</a> calling it "a sharp-witted workplace comedy that charms with its smart dialogue choices, great writing, and lovably aggravating cast." You can play it without big black censor bars on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-superhero-comedy-dispatch-will-soon-no-longer-be-playstation-console-exclusive">PC or PlayStation 5</a>, but no Xbox version yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1419070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">With Daggerheart's release last year, and outings in the Age of Umbra by Critical Role and Colossus of the Drylands by Legends of Avantris, the latest Daggerheart adventure comes from New Zealand's Viva La Dirt League by way of Daggerheart Azarim.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the world of Azerim, the setting of Viva's Adventures of Azerim D&amp;D series and their skit series Epic NPC Man, this four-part mini-series picks up an adventure with 'Baradun and the Dickheads' as they get lost in a cave system using the Beast Feast campaign setting of Daggerheart.</p><p dir="ltr">As the series is already running, TechRaptor had a chance to sit down with Viva La Dirt League GM Robert Hartley to talk Daggerheart, learning while playing, and how eating food and telling stories is just about the most human thing you can do.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Daggerheart: Azarim Came To Be</h2><p dir="ltr">To begin, I was interested in hearing how the collaboration between Viva La Dirt League and Critical Role came about. As was expected of two busy production companies, this has been in the work for a long time. "We've all been fans of Critical Role for quite some time and aware of what they do as both a production company and also as content creators in general," Hartley began "I think it was about two years ago that contact first started so there was a lot of discussion for collaboration."</p><p dir="ltr">"Then Daggerheart started to come out [...] and I was really keen to try it out. For Halloween each year I do a different thing outside of D&amp;D for the Viva guys. [...] I had this idea that I wanted to do 'Honey, I shrunk the kinds' kind of thing where I shrunk their Tech Town characters and have them within the tech store. I decided I'm going to use the duality dice system [...] and so I used that without the classes of Daggerheart and I really loved it."</p><p dir="ltr">From there it wasn't a matter of 'if' but 'when' they'd play a larger game of Daggerheart. "Then [Critical Role] got in touch and said 'would you like to play Daggerheart?' and we said it was perfect timing."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Beast Feast Puts Cooking In Your TTRPG</h2><p dir="ltr">The Campaign Frame that Daggerheart: Azerim is based on is Beast Feast. Here, there is a focus on food as players can harvest different components from killed creatures to make meals that restore their HP, Stress, and Armor.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I thought it was an incredible idea of Darrington Press to include everything you would need to play in one book" - Robert Hartley</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I took a few options and said 'I'd be interested in running this, this, or this' and I pitched each [Campaign Frame] to them as the Campaign Frame is described, they've got a pitch page. Ultimately, we all decided it would be Beast Feast."</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley lamented that he feel like in D&amp;D and other TTRPG systems the downtime is often ignored or treated like filler so you don't quite get as many moments of characters around a campfire. With Beast Feast, Hartley was excited that these downtime moments were built into the gameplay. He did add that this Campaign Frame definitely wasn't for everyone as there was lifting to do on the DMs part making more systems for the cooking but that he was a huge fan of building these kinds of systems.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Playing as Baradun and the Dickheads each of the party members already had a rapport with one another, as well as powerful Dungeons &amp; Dragons character sheets so it was Hartley's job to convert them to Daggerheart.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Moving A Character Over To Daggerheart</h2><p dir="ltr">Hartley explained that in porting over the characters, recreating them in a close likeness to their D&amp;D counterparts, it was easy for the majority of characters as they had comparable classes and abilities across the system, but for characters like Greg the Onion Farmer, it was a bit harder.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking positively of the experienc,e Hartley explained it was a good way for him to throw himself into the deep end of learning Daggerheart. Additionally, it allowed him to learn each of the characters in and out and then plan a story in a way to give each player a chance to show off their skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley joked "Some people would see it as 'oh, they're forcing their GM to do all the work instead of porting their own characters over' but instead it gave me an insight."</p><p dir="ltr">"The hardest one was that in every game that I've ever played, that's trying to get Greg over. When I first started working with Viva and I was trying to introduce them to D&amp;D I already had the problem of going 'ok, I'm going to make from scratch a new Shopkeeper class'."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">From there, Hartley moved Greg to be an Artificer, but the complexity of the class didn't really match the vibes of the show, before Greg became a Cleric to focus on support. Now in Daggerheart, he was moved again to be a Seraph.</p><h2 dir="ltr">&nbsp;Learning Daggerheart Through Play</h2><p dir="ltr">An aspect I've enjoyed of Daggerheart: Azarim in the same way I enjoyed watching Legends of Avantris' Dust To Damnation is how as the game is going on the rules and mechanics are being introduced to the party with time to ask questions and understand rules.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of our unique selling points is that we are one of the more accessible actual plays. Over the years I used to get a little bit frustrated at just how long we'd played together with them still not knowing the basic rules, but one of the things that changed my mind is I started speaking to people at conventions and over and over again people said 'It's wonderful that I was able to get into D&amp;D and understand it because of the number of times you repeat the rules.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley also highlighted that this repetition of the rules is also accessible for those who are new in the space that might feel worried about having to ask those 'basic' questions.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Hartley explained that before going into Daggerheart: Azarim he'd provided the players with some of the absolute basics like how the dice function, their abilities, etc but planned to be teaching the rest as they played giving the players and audience the space to learn how to play Daggerheart through the adventure.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I told them what they needed to know, and I told them what was optional to know, and I left it at that"</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I did have to ask how Hartley felt when he had planned out a big adventure for these players and the first dice roll resulted in a combined 6 on the Duality Dice with a -1 modifier, and that the very next roll was a 1 and a 2 with fear, the lowest/worst Daggerheart roll you can pull off.</p><p dir="ltr">"I joked with Ben, who has the worst dice rolls. I said 'Hey man, one of the great things about Daggerheart is that there's no way to Critical Fail' [...] and he goes 'I'll find a way.'"</p><h2 dir="ltr">TTRPGs And Food</h2><p dir="ltr">Talking so much about TTRPGs and the cooking and sharing of food I was interested to learn from Hartley what his favorite snacks and food to bring to the table are. While they don't snack at the Viva table, when playing at home "there's usually bags of chips, chocolate straws, lots of biscuits, and bags of [gummy candy]. We have a rule at our game that the first person to ask 'what are we eating' needs to be in charge of picking."</p><p dir="ltr">One interesting twist at Hartley's table is that as the food is set to arrive he'll like to navigate his players to a situation where they're eating in the game as well as in real life. "As you've entered this nobles domain he invites you in to join him at the table 'please, come in, I've got some hors d'oeuvres laid out…"</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Talking deeper on the very human aspect of telling stories and sharing food Hartley also added "Storytelling is at it's heart a fundamental human thing. It's something we've been doing longer than anything else and it's why we have civilization. Other animals can communicate 'danger coming' but humans are the only ones who can communicate complex ideas to a point where we can pass down learning. Just as fundamental is sharing food as a social species. We're not all capable of hunting or gathering the food so we evolved to share the food with one another.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out Hartley, Baradun, and the Dickheads in Daggerheart: Azerim.
