<p>The next game in the nearly 30-year-old Age of Empires franchise is in development, and it will seemingly be using Unreal Engine. That would see the company leave the Essence Engine and Bang Engine, which had been used for Age of Empires 4 and Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition, respectively, behind. </p>



<p>According to multiple job postings on Microsoft’s website, Xbox Game Studios is “hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires”. As the work continues on the franchise, World’s Edge, the studio behind Age of Empires 4 and the definitive editions of the second and third games, is looking for two positions that specifically call out using Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>The two roles—Pricing Unreal Engineer and Senior Unreal Engineer—require those with <strong>“a background in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;Unreal Engine&nbsp;game&nbsp;development&nbsp;and experience&nbsp;leading external resources.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details on what the future could look like for Age of Empires, but the direction it’s going in, at least when it comes to the tech stack, seems clear. </p>



<p>What do you hope for from the next installment in Age of Empires, seemingly Age of Empires 5?

Analyst Rhys Elliott of Aliena Analytics said in <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his newsletter</a> that the game reached 1.8 million pre-sales on Steam alone prior to launch, which works out to more than $100 million in revenue. Right now, Battlefield 6 ranks as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 best-selling game on Steam</a> in the US and globally.</p><p>"All signs, at least pre-launch, suggest Battlefield is back in the fight. Our estimates reflect a perfect storm of pent-up demand after years of missteps and a huge potential comeback narrative," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Glenn Israel has worked on the Halo franchise for 17 years, joining Bungie back in 2008 when the studio was known for Halo, and stayed with the series by following it to 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) where he has been since. He is no longer working on the series that he spent nearly two decades with, however, as he announced with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">a statement on his LinkedIn</a> that he has left Halo Studios, though the statement leaves plenty of questions as to the circumstances under which he is leaving.</p>



<p>"<em>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe</em>," Israel wrote. "<em>There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year</em>. <em>In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I know that</em> <em>the state of our industry seems dire but never forget that you are free to choose. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong. As always, I'll be here if you need to talk</em>."</p>



<p>As Israel mentions, he'll share more about the details of his departure at some point in 2026, but his statement also seems to suggest he's not leaving amicably.</p>



<p>It's no secret that 343 Industries/Halo Studios has had its struggles in the last few years, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/">key members of the team leaving</a> before Israel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">layoffs and allegations towards parent company Microsoft for the studio's internal issues</a>, and fans turning on the studio for decisions <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">like leaving behind couch co-op on Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-microsotrancation-plans-abandoned/">almost including microtransactions in the Master Chief Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The future of the series has been unclear amidst all of this, particularly since Halo Infinite <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-team-fell-short-on-post-launch-plan-retrenched-now-booty/">didn't exactly hit its mark at launch</a>. As far as what we know is next for the series, Halo Studios has committed to sharing more at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo World Championships taking place later this month on October 24</a>, which could also be where <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">a rumoured remake of Halo Combat Evolved is first revealed</a>.</p>



<p>Whenever Israel is able to share more about his departure, it'll be interesting to see what he touches on and how the changes to the studio and its struggles impacted his decision to leave Halo behind.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-logitech-webcam-works-with-switch-2-and-is-practically-free-compared-to-nintendo%E2%80%99s.1321864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you had been hoping to snag yourself some cool new tech gadget on sale during Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days, you’re not out of luck just yet. While the event only extended from October 7 to October 8, some products are still on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> This Logitech webcam for example is normally listed at $40, but right now has been marked down by 36% off. That ends up saving you $14 as the price comes down to only $26 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The Logitech Brio 101 is a Full HD 1080p webcam that comes in your choice of either black or white and can be mounted easily on top of your monitor, TV, or laptop screen. The camera utilizes auto-light balance which can on the fly boost brightness and reduce shadows to allow folks you’re on the video call with to see you crystal clear, regardless of the lighting conditions of the room you’re in. Then when no longer in user, the cover slide can be closed over to ensure your privacy when you’re not on a video call.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The webcam has a built-in microphone so you can cut down on the number of peripherals needed to join and Zoom or Discord call with colleagues, friends, or family. It is also compatible with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and a number of other video conferencing applications.</p>
<h2>Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s follow-up to the immensely successful Switch saw some of the lightest changes from its predecessor. That’s not a bad thing. Many Nintendo fans just wanted more of the same, just on better performing hardware, though Nintendo can’t help themselves but to squeeze in one or two new gimmicks.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features all new chat functionality including the ability to have video calls with friends. Some games even support integrating your video feed to the gameplay, super imposing your video onto in-game elements. Nintendo has its own proprietary USB camera and a handful of — but not all — third party cameras support the Nintendo Switch 2. Luckily, the Logitech Brio 101 is one of those that is supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, so you can enjoy gaming and chatting with your friends with a webcam at a fraction of the price Nintendo sells its for.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is listed at $55.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> The Logitech Brio 101 webcam is usually $40, but with the 36% discount, it comes down to just $24.</a> That’s less than half the price the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera sells for.</p>

              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>revealed at Gamescom earlier this year</span></a><span>, the trailer looked like a blocky version of the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games, which we haven’t gotten a proper sequel to in a decade. Yeah, the name </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span> has been slapped on VR spin-offs and mobile apps, but there hasn’t been an honest-to-god open-world </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>action game since </span><i><span>Arkham Knight </span></i><span>in 2015. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-nightwing-dlc-wb-games-1850378621"><i><span>Gotham Knights</span></i></a> <span>came close, but was weighed down by loot nonsense and a miserable grind. Rocksteady, the developer of the original trilogy, pivoted to the loot shooter </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><span>which didn’t go over well</span></a><span>. So there’s been a dearth of interesting </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>games in recent years, and while I figured it would come to an end at some point, I just expect the next to come from </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>developer TT Games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>’s trailer showed the mini-figure version of the Caped Crusader grappling around Gotham, descending upon unsuspecting baddies, and investigating crime scenes just like he did in games like </span><i><span>Arkham City</span></i><span>. I played about 30 minutes of the game, and even though I hadn’t played any of the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games in a decade, my muscle memory kicked in when I was surrounded by a group of minifigure goons and the parry prompt appeared over one of their heads. People joke that </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>’s beat-em-up combat is a rhythm game because every action, whether it be a punch, the swing of a bat, or the firing of a gun, has an equivalent QTE prompt response coded into Batman’s arsenal of moves. When you really get into the groove, Batman is practically dancing across a battlefield as he dodges, parries, and punches, and even with the more snappy </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>movement, it still feels fluid and rhythmic. It is quite literally an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game, albeit with the slapstick </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>flair you’ve come to expect from its parodies. Batman’s finishing moves are less of the “you expect me to believe that man isn’t dead?” brutality we see Bruce Wayne dish out in </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>, and more silly stuff like covering an enemy’s head with a trash can. Foes still break apart like any Lego character would, but I guess if you can just rebuild anything in these games, that’s not </span><i><span>technically </span></i><span>Batman breaking his no-kill rule.</span></p>

  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>comparisons don’t stop at fights, as </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>also has an open world to grapple and glide around. Though the pieced-together Gotham City might not be as atmospheric and dour as Rocksteady’s, getting around the crime-ridden Lego metropolis is just as satisfying. It’s easy to get distracted grappling to every high platform or gliding around with Batman’s wings spread over the city, but </span><i><span>Legacy </span></i><span>has enough of the random crime missions and collectibles that even a detour from your original objective is usually rewarded with something to do. You’re also able to ride around the city in the Batmobile, but I was so caught up in flying around the rooftops that I actually forgot to head to the ground level and drive around. My bad.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>clearly has a lot of </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>influence, it still has </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>foundations. The game can be played with couch co-op or by swapping between characters on the fly if you’re riding solo. The section I played, which had Batman and Commissioner Gordon infiltrating an Ace Chemicals plant, had puzzles that required both characters to solve. Batman’s gadgets can clear certain obstacles–his grappling hook, for instance, letting you pull locks off walls and crates–while Gordon has a gun that can stop up air vents or leaking pipes to clear the way for you to move forward. It’s easy enough to go back and forth between characters, but I imagine those segments will feel more rewarding when you have a second player next to you and it actually feels like a team effort. Gordon is one of several buddy characters Batman will team up with in </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>People might have an image of </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games in their minds as games with simple co-op action and a lot of referential humor, and </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>has all of that. But it’s also the closest thing to an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game we’ve gotten in years, and what I played so far makes it feel like a competent one. We’ll see how well it holds together or breaks apart when it comes to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2 in 2026.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly 100 past and present employees at Mindseye developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter against the studio for its “longstanding disrespect and mistreatment” of staff.</p>



<p>Published on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">Friday by the IWGB Game Workers</a>, this letter directly calls out several issues employees claim to have faced from management, including founder Leslie Benzies. </p>



<p>After the poorly received launch of Mindseye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-developerbegins-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Build a Rocket Boy laid off</a> what the union says was 250-300 people because of their refusal to <strong>“listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter says that there was a “lack of transparency and communication”. The employees believe that <strong>“information has been sparse and vague, with you (Benzies) often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter also mentions the studio implementing a mandatory eight hours of overtime per week for every employee in the four months leading up to the game’s launch. Time Off In Lieu was given to the staff at seven hours per every eight worked, but, they say that many employees have yet to be able to use any of the time off because of <strong>“continued requests for extra “high-priority” work, even after launch.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding layoffs, the letter calls what has happened a “disastrous handling”. It’s alleged that employees were given wrong information, including being grouped with the wrong internal teams, and given wrong notice periods, which may have seen a number of employees wrongfully dismissed.</p>



<p>The employees, both current and former, are demanding a public apology for the mistreatment as well as <strong>“proper compensation”</strong> for those who were let go. They are also asking for a meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions within the company that includes acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union, a commitment to using external partners for future redundancies, and the option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work the rest of their time or take Payment in Lieu of Notice.</p>



<p>The letter closes with calling out Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, saying, “you often refer to your employees as ‘family’. But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the letter. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>With Battlefield 6 launching today, players will be going straight in to check out the maps that weren’t available during the game’s open beta weekends. Some players are so excited, they have already started recreating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode. Now, the developers have revealed why they opted for smaller maps in BF6’s open beta. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-open-beta-s-smaller-maps-made-it-easier-to-test-different-aspects-of-the-game">Battlefield 6 Open Beta’s Smaller Maps Made it Easier to Test Different Aspects of the Game </h2>



<p>In a new interview in <a href="https://www.pcgamer-magazine.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer Magazine’s 415 issue</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-devs-say-the-plan-was-to-launch-with-bigger-maps-all-along-and-that-the-betas-notoriously-smaller-maps-were-intentionally-smaller-than-the-ones-we-know-are-coming-in-the-full-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>), the design director for Battlefield 6, Salim Fasahat, explained why the game’s open beta had smaller maps. Fasahat first stated, &nbsp;“They were intentionally smaller than the ones we know are coming.” He added that there were a few reasons behind this decision, including gaining a better understanding of different modes, the scale at which they can operate, which types of maps work, and more. </p>



<p>Fasahat added that the smaller BF6 maps made it “easier to test and focus on gun play.” The whole team is “super excited to have people explore all of those maps.” For those wondering, Manhattan Bridge, Saints Quarter, New Sobek City, Mirak Valley, and Operation Firestorm were not available in the Open Beta. The maps that players have already tested include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, and Empire State. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game will not use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generative AI</a>. Additionally, the Portal community is already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a>.

                <p>Dozens of employees and former workers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/">Mindseye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter to the studio's leadership, demanding a response to allegations of the staff being mistreated. Together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain, the 93 BARB employees and ex-employees have singled out studio leaders Mark Gerhard and former GTA lead developer Leslie Benzies, citing various issues.</p><p>According to the letter, BARB leadership allegedly failed to effectively communicate with workers, and staff were subjected to "unbearable" levels of overtime in the four months leading to the launch of MindsEye. The workers also claim that redundancies have been "mishandled" and have caused distress for all employees.</p><p>"These and many other issues, some of which have been made public already, have caused pain and stress for your employees," <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/" rel="nofollow ">the letter reads</a>. "Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><p>The workers are demanding a public apology, proper compensation, and several other changes to provide a fair working environment and change the company culture. "Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.' But we ask you to consider, is this really how you treat your own?" the letter concluded.</p><p>BARB was founded by former Rockstar/GTA boss Leslie Benzies several years ago, and its first major release, the GTA-like MindsEye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/">became one of the worst-reviewed games</a> of the year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/">Developers have been "working around the clock" since it launched</a> in an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-developer-commits-to-troubled-game-lays-out-roadmap-for-fixes/1100-6533452/">fix its many issues</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-studio-is-laying-off-developers-following-poor-launch-reception-report/1100-6532630/">layoffs at the studio were reportedly happening</a> following the game's disastrous release. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/">A pair of senior executives left the developer</a> before the game launched.</p>

The report said the game was canceled early in development and would have put players in control of a Black protagonist who escaped enslavement and started a new life away from the South. He is later recruited by the Assassins, returns to the South, and confronts prominent racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>It would not have been the first Assassin's Creed game set in North America, as Assassin's Creed III takes place during the American Revolution, set in 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier. That game generated some controversy in part for its post-launch DLC pack, The Tyranny of King Washington, which takes place in a different reality when George Washington crowns himself king.</p><p>Ineson is a veteran English actor with more than 150 credits to his name. Most recently, he played Galactus in The Fantastic Four: First Steps. He's also known for his roles in The Office, Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, The Witch, The Green Knight, and The Creator.

            <p>Tavern Keeper will finally enter early access on Steam on 3rd November, following 11 years of development.</p>
<p>The fantasy pub sim from Greenheart Games is the studio's follow-up to the hugely popular Game Dev Tycoon, and merges tavern management with RPG tropes as players serve dwarves, orcs, and humans alike.</p>
<p>The game is narrated by British actor Steven Pacey, perhaps best known for his role in the '80s sci-fi series Blake's 7, but more recently heard in video games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a> (as The Rat King) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> (as the old monkey), as well as TV series House of the Dragon and Love, Death &amp; Robots.</p>

<p>Judging from the trailer above, Tavern Keeper has a British, Two Point meets Fable sort of vibe, despite coming from an international team. If you're keen to try it out before its early access launch, there's an updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/">demo available on Steam now</a> ahead of Steam Next Fest later this month.</p><p>"After 11 years we're ready to open the doors to our follow-up to Game Dev Tycoon. Our hybrid management sim, witty RPG and decoration sandbox game Tavern Keeper, will launch into Early Access in November," said Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games. "It's been a long journey, and we're thrilled that players can soon experience what we've been crafting for them over so many years."</p>
<p>Eurogamer last went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tavern-keeper-lets-you-run-a-pub-staffed-by-orcs">hands-on with Tavern Keeper</a> back in 2019, when contributor Johnny Chiodini described it as a "really loving, mischievous game".</p>
<p>"It's clearly made with a great deal of reverence for simulator games and the fantasy genre, but there's a delightful sense of humour at play that makes it more than the sum of its parts," wrote Johnny.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-minecraft-movie-2-confirmed-2027</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-minecraft-movie-2-confirmed-for-2027-surprising-absolutely-nobody.1321831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a shocking turn of events, this year's box office smash hit&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is officially getting a sequel. I bet you couldn't possibly have seen that one coming.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/minecraft-2-release-date-1236574896/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline report</a>,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2&nbsp;</em>(which probably won't be its final title, if only because&nbsp;<em>Another Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is staring the filmmakers right in the face) is set for release on July 23rd, 2027.</p>

<p><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess will once again helm the sequel, and the script is being written by Hess and Chris Galletta, the latter of whom was one of the five writers for the first&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie. Whether more writers will join the sequel in future remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=CtajRS-4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=lCUjvW2R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know whether any cast members from&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will return for the sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the movie is well over a year and a half away from release, other details about the project are scarce right now, so we don't know whether actors like Jack Black and Jason Momoa will be reprising their roles in&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2</em>.</p>

<p>Similarly, we don't know what kind of narrative direction the sequel will take, but Deadline says "the buzz" around the project is that "there were always other worlds to build out and characters in the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-verse", so there should be at least a few new faces in the movie.</p>

<p>If you missed the original&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it was released earlier this year, and while it hasn't broken $1 billion at the box office yet, it's easily the highest-grossing movie in the US domestically, as well as the second highest-grossing movie of the year around the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell’s decided to show the competition just how a serious laptop deal gets done. They’ve taken one of their premier models — a 2025 Inspiron 15.6-Inch Full-HD Touchscreen with 32GB of RAM, a massive 2TB SSD, and Windows 11 Professional preloaded — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">and taken a 72% hack out of its price, listing it for just $869 at Amazon</a>. For added incentive they’re throwing in a $199 accessories bundle, with a wireless mouse, USB hub, and more, on the house.</p>
<p>All that built-in processing heft, not to mention the Intel 13th Gen 10-core i5-1334U processor with 12M cache and speeds reaching 4.6GHz, are almost unheard of in a laptop being offered at such a dramatically reduced price. Then there’s the touchscreen, which presents all sorts of possibilities, especially when you add an inexpensive stylus to mark up, draw, edit, and perform all kinds of productive and creative tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Absolute Upgrade</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve bought a brand-new laptop within the past 12 months or so, this 2025 model Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop would almost certainly be an upgrade for you, even above and beyond the preloaded Windows 11 Pro with Microsoft Copilot that would normally cost you a subscription fee. When you read about all the perks and bells and whistles packed into this Dell Inspiron, you might just start looking differently at your current laptop and all of its little flaws, slowdowns, and outdated bits.</p>
<p>And while that 2TB SSD is more than likely going to be enough for as long as you have this Dell laptop, you can add to the ample 32GB of RAM for faster and more efficient multitasking by adding to the two available memory slots, all the way up to 64GB. The Wi-Fi 6 connection will be among the fastest for some time to come, and the vast range of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card reader, add to the future-proof qualities of this Dell laptop.</p>



<h2>Don’t Ask Questions</h2>
<p>What else can we say about this seriously upper-echelon Dell touchscreen laptop? It’s ultra-slim in construction and weighs a very commuter-friendly 3.66 pounds, so there’s no size issue. You might be able to take issue with the modest 6-hour battery life, but as complaints go, that’s small potatoes.</p>
<p>Is this a post-Prime Day deal? Or is it a very-very-early Black Friday deal? There’s really no sense overthinking it when you see a outstanding laptop like this 2025 Dell Inspiron with a 15.6-inch full-HD touchscreen, tons of memory and storage, Windows 11 Pro and Copilot locked and loaded, and a bundle of free accessories take a huge price dip like this. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">Head to Amazon now before someone changes their mind about offering this superstar laptop for just $869.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production.1321822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting closer to pulling back the curtain and releasing its next SteamVR headset to the world. According to one Chinese analyst group, the next headset has reportedly entered mass production. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, XR Research Institute claims that a production of 400,000-600,000 headsets is happening for the device that has been codenamed “Deckard”. There’s even the belief that the headset, which is expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to be called the Valve Frame</a>, could be announced and released before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Adding to the legitimacy of the claim, Valve insider Brad Lynch says that Deckard DV1 and DV2 models recently appeared in the SteamVR Beta. According to Lynch, <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details regarding pricing or specs are currently known. What is expected, however, is that the headset will launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers being developed for the device.</p>



<p>The SteamVR headset isn’t the only piece of tech Valve has been working on. During the summer, what appears to be Valve’s next attempt at a console, Valve Fremont, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared for the first time</a> on the benchmarking website Geekbench. The appearance on the site suggests a device featuring a six-core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz with 8GB of DDR5 memory and a custom AMD RX 7600 GPU. Those specs, however, can always change between now and when the device officially launches. </p>



<p>What do you think of a new SteamVR headset coming from Valve as soon as this year? When do you think it’ll be officially announced?

<p>During a new interview, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion spoke about not using generative AI in Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 finally launches today, October 10, on all platforms. Ahead of the release, the developers have revealed several details about the title through interviews, with the lead producer recently stating that the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers should be ready for launch</a>. Now, another person from the development team has spoken about generative AI and BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-generative-ai-is-very-seducing-but-won-t-be-used-in-battlefield-6">Generative AI is ‘Very Seducing’ But Won’t be Used in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>During a new interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion, Rebecka Coutaz, spoke about Battlefield 6 and generative AI. Coutaz first stated that players will not see GenAI in BF6; however, it was used in the preparatory stages to provide “more time and more space to be creative.” The VP added that GenAI “is very seducing”, but at the moment there is no way to incorporate it into the daily work that the developer does. </p>



<p>Coutaz discussed GenAI further, stating that they can “break the magic with AI,” enabling them to be more innovative and creative. According to the VP, GenAI is “not anything to be scared of in our industry”. The gaming industry is “an environment at the bleeding edge of technology,” where teams are accustomed to change. The only challenge is how they can productively incorporate them into their workflows, which helps them take their games to the next level.  </p>



<p>In other news, the Battlefield 6 community is already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a>. Additionally, players on PlayStation can earn more XP than those on Xbox or PC. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 not using generative AI?

Surely that can’t be right. That feels worse than the drop rate in previous Borderlands games I’ve played. Perhaps there’s a flaw in Siphonicfir’s work? A bug in the system, maybe? I thought it best to have a chat to find out. “Data analysis and stats are just a personal interest, though I would absolutely love to find work in that field,” they told me. “I have a passion for it and I would like to think I have a knack for it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into the Q&amp;A, below, let’s get some housekeeping out the way. All Siphonicfir’s kills were done on the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode 5 difficulty (currently the hardest in the game), as Vex. The drops were tracked from the moment Siphonicfir unlocked UVHM5 to limit sampling errors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weekly Encore Bosses are excluded from the total since they have dramatically different drop rates that would skew the overall data set. Class Bosses are bosses that have class mods as dedicated drops (Siphonicfir certainly has thoughts on class mods, more on that below!). Multi Bosses are encounters with multiple named enemies that each have a typical drop chance. And Normal Bosses are every boss that didn't fall into the other two categories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on if you fancy getting into the weeds on how Borderlands 4 drop rates actually work, based on someone who’s put A LOT of effort into finding out. I hope that if you’re into the game, or looter shooters in general, you’ll find something insightful here. I certainly did! And thanks to Siphonicfir for their time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What drove you to do this in the first place?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I was driven to do this by a desire to know what is actually going on in looter games. I want to know what sort of odds I am trying to beat when I am grinding a game. Unfortunately the drop rates in this type of game are often not communicated to the player in any way, so the only way to really know is to collect the data myself. It also makes the grind more enjoyable since I am working towards the overarching goal of clarity. Even when I don’t get the item I'm technically farming for, each run is still another data point towards the truth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How much time have you spent doing this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> In Borderlands 4 I would say I spent about 150 hours collecting this data. But I have done it for other games in the past such as Diablo 4 and Destiny 2. In total I would say I have spent about 400 hours collecting and organizing drop rate data for these games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How many boss kills in total went into this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> The spreadsheet featured in the post was a compilation of 3,035 kills worth of data. Technically 3,635 if you count the multi bosses as three kills each since they are treated as three individual bosses. I have since recorded more data while playing with my friends, but that data isn’t represented in the post.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did you actually loot everything?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> To actually loot everything and record the data, I would have the notes app open on my phone. After each kill, either during the boss's death animation or during the phase portal animation, I would add one run to the total kills of that boss. I would pick up every legendary during this process, then after the farming session was over I would record how many of each legendary I received during that session. Then to create the post, I created a spreadsheet and compiled all the data from my notes app into sheets to run the necessary calculations to produce the drop rates.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In your conclusions, you say the drop rate should be doubled. Why is 10% the sweet spot?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I think 10% is the sweet spot for dedicated items for two reasons. One reason is precedent, as that was the drop rate in Borderlands 2. I think that game is widely regarded as the best game in the franchise, and I am almost certain the community thinks it was the best game for farming. 10% created a perfect balance where a drop always feels special, but you never go too long without one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nerdier math answer, and my primary reason to push for the change, is the severity of outliers. For example in my data the longest cold streak was when I farmed Fractis. It took 96 runs to get a single UAV grenade to drop. The odds of not getting the item 96 consecutive times at a 5% drop rate are about 1 in 137. In stark contrast, at a 10% drop chance, the odds of going cold for 96 trials in a row are just 1 in 24,703. Going from 5% to 10% isn’t just doubling the chance, it's reducing the worst possible outlier outcomes by a factor of 180. Those outcomes make people give up or quit due to frustration and should be limited as much as possible. An increase to 10% would make a world of difference in limiting the most egregious outlier scenarios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you feel about class mods?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I strongly dislike the way class mods drop in Borderlands 4. I think it is extremely frustrating that there is no weighting towards the vault hunter you are playing. As I mentioned in the post, if all classes drop equally, then three quarters of your class mods will be for other classes. I understand Gearbox wants class mods for other classes to drop to encourage you to play those other classes or just so you can share the loot with your friends who play those classes, but I think the current system is extreme. I suggested in the post weighting the drops towards your class to some degree. I think as low as 40% for your class and 20% for each other class would be fine, but I would prefer 70% or higher for your class and 10% for the others. For reference it currently seems to be 25% across the board.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did anything in your data surprise you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I was particularly surprised by two bosses in my data, the Rippa Roadbirds and Vile Ted &amp; The Experiments. I actually created the category of “Multi Bosses” because their numbers were so out of the ordinary. These bosses are collections of three named enemies, and based on my testing the game treats each individual enemy as a boss with the typical loot drops. So each run of these encounters are equal to three boss kills, effectively tripling the efficiency of these sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was also surprised by just how low the drop rate is. Very early on within the first week I had heard community speculation that the drop rate was between 1/10 and 1/15 from creators such as Joltzdude139, so I was quite surprised and frankly disappointed when it turned out to be just 1/20 (5%).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You say you have many more thoughts on the drop rates and RNG. What are they?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I do have many more thoughts, honestly more than even this. I feel like I could write pages on this topic but I will summarize best I can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I fundamentally disagree with the design philosophy of many of these games in the sense that I think truly perfect gear should be obtainable in a possible amount of time. And the phrasing there is important because while perfect loot is technically possible in Borderlands 4, it isn’t actually realistic to obtain. When the initial drop rate is just 5%, and then you stack the RNG of the standard part system on top of that, and then stack the RNG of the licensed parts on top of that, you hit a point where the odds compound so much that getting a truly perfect item starts to approach or even exceed real life lottery odds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A good example of this was the class mod system in Wonderlands. Those items had a 1 in billions chance of dropping with a perfect roll. Some members of the Borderlands community like that chase. They never actually want their perfect item to drop, they want to chase the idea of perfection without ever actually achieving it. If they get their drop, then they “have nothing to chase” which is a mentality I just never understood. Borderlands 4 is designed for those “chase” players, and that is fine. But it isn’t what I want from Borderlands. I want to farm perfect gear and actually use it. I want to put together a truly perfect build and then go take on the hardest challenge to put it to the test. That said, loot shouldn’t be free by any means. I am willing to put the time in, but for me that means a few hundred hours, not a few hundred days, weeks, or even months of playtime. But that mindset seems to be a minority opinion, so perfect loot continues to only exist in theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think a major contributing factor to this lack of attainability is the general absence of statistical literacy. I think most players and honestly most people in the world don’t effectively process probabilities and statistics at all. Add in optimism bias, which tends to make people overestimate their own ability to beat the odds, and suddenly the “chase” players grossly misunderstand how low the odds need to be for them to never get what they want. The devs have to make the odds truly absurd because odds like 1 in 5,000 sound too attainable to the lay player, even though those same players won’t kill any single boss more than 500 times, let alone 5,000. Most players just do not understand the relevant math and statistics at play in these types of games, and that is contributing to the problems with attainability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there any evidence to suggest Gearbox tweaks the drop rates behind the scenes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I have no evidence that Gearbox tweaked drop rates behind the scenes, in fact my data reflects the opposite. Even my earliest data which was collected in the first week of the game's lifespan aligns with the overall totals, indicating a consistent drop rate throughout all my data collection since release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What do you plan to do now? Are you actually finished with Borderlands 4?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I am not really sure what I will do now. I am actually finished with Borderlands 4 at least from a solo play perspective. I will still be logging on if my friends ask me to play, but I won’t be playing of my own accord until the game receives a significant update. I might play the new Diablo season and start tracking data for the new chaos uniques in season 10, but I am a little burnt out for now so it will be a bit before I make that decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What's your take on the game overall?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> Overall I am torn on how to feel about Borderlands 4. I think it arguably has the best campaign in the franchise and the first playthrough experience from level 1-50 is superb even among other Borderlands games. But this is pretty clearly the weakest endgame offering since the Pre Sequel, especially when compared to the prior games as they are today with all DLC and patches released. I expect that to get addressed over time, we know there is at least one raid boss on the way, but ultimately I was disappointed that the sixth game in the franchise made the same mistake of launching with a lackluster endgame AGAIN. I think for more casual fans of the franchise, this is the best Borderlands yet. But for players like myself that really value that endgame challenge and gear grind, I think Borderlands 2, 3, and even Wonderlands were more satisfying for me personally.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4.

                <p>One gameplay staple of extraction shooters is the regular "wipe" that resets everyone's in-game progress back to square one. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/news/">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios knows that this system can be controversial, and to keep things fair, the studio aims to make wipes a voluntary feature of the game through its Expedition Projects.</p><p>Players will unlock an Expedition Project at level 20. Each Expedition cycle runs for roughly eight weeks and players will contribute toward overall progress. Once the Expedition is complete, they'll have the option to reset their progress and lose all gained levels, skills, and their inventory, while their cosmetics and achievements will remain. Players who do not complete an Expedition can instead carry their progress over to the next cycle.</p>

<p>Ideally, this will keep things balanced for everyone. Players who don't have as much time to commit to playing Arc Raiders won't have to worry about booting up the game and discovering that they've lost all their progress, while dedicated players will be rewarded with unique cosmetic rewards, permanent account unlocks, and buffs that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle.</p><p>Design director Virgil added that players who gain these benefits will not have a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset. It's all about bragging rights, as expressed through the cosmetics they'll earn. "It's not a silver bullet, and [it] won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" rel="nofollow ">Virgil wrote</a>.</p><p>Arc Raiders launches on October 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Ahead of its arrival, Embark Studios will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-having-one-more-stress-test-before-launch-and-itll-be-open-to-everyone/1100-6534921/">Server Slam Open Test from October 17-19 on PC and console</a>, and while progress won't carry over to the full game, participation will unlock an exclusive backpack cosmetic for use in the full game.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> launches today and is currently sitting at the peak of Steam's top sellers rankings, with one analyst estimating it has already made over $100m in sales before coming out.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game on the platform right now, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. It's also the fourth most-Wishlisted game, beaten only by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, and Light No Fire. It's followed by Arc Raiders in fifth, and Kingmakers in sixth place.</p>
<p>According to estimates from video game analyst <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield">Rhys Elliot in the Alinea Newsletter</a>, the game has already made over roughly $100m in pre-launch sales on Steam. Elliot also stated the game has over 3.5m wishlists on Steam, as well as 1.8m pre-orders on the platform.</p>

<p>These stats come in the wake of a series of popular open betas for Battlefield 6, during which a concurrent peak player count of 865,233 was reached on Steam alone. These betas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">described as the best performing Battlefield betas ever</a>, led to a surge of interest in the title. So much so that a blast from the past Call of Duty vs Battlefield debate has emerged, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">one EA has not been shy about wading into</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in trying out Battlefield 6 when it launches today, check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review</a> first. In it, reviewer Rick Lane notes: "Ultimately though, Battlefield 6 clearly understands what makes the series special, even if it occasionally seems reluctant to accept it. Unlike 2042, the fun is easy to find from the outset, and what problems it has are much simpler to fix. It could be more ambitious, and I'd like more of those larger sandboxes to play in, but overall Battlefield 6 is a reliable reset - and, crucially, a very strong foundation for EA to build upon."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-update-brings-ugc-and-more-later-this-month.1321780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed the release date for Version Luna II, the gacha action RPG's next major update, and it's arriving later this month.</p>

<p>Version Luna II continues the new naming conventions established for the game with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">September's Version Luna I</a>, and it's set to land on October 22nd. You can expect the advent of the new user-generated content system, plus a new character and much more.</p>

<p>As teased during Version Luna I's cycle, the Miliastra Wonderland, which serves as&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s UGC hub, will make its debut in this new update. That means "hundreds of Stages that encourage creativity and exploration", according to HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-nefer.jpg?itok=_3su92lj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-nefer.jpg?itok=Zmzjtfi3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nefer is your new playable character in the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>The Miliastra Wonderland will allow you either to experience other players' creations or to make your own as a Craftsperson, utilizing the built-in editing tool to create whatever&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>experience your mind can conjure up.</p>

<p>If you're not into the whole user-generated content stuff, though, don't worry; there's still plenty of classic&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>for you to enjoy in Version Luna II, including a new Archon Quest that will see the return of "many old friends".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new playable character in the form of Nefer, a Dendro catalyst user who utilizes her diverse toolkit to empower her Charged Attacks and deal extra damage to enemies on the field.</p>

<p>Nefer will appear as part of this update's first half, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a>, and you can expect repeats of Arlecchino and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert" rel="nofollow">Zhongli</a> during Version Luna II's second half, so if you missed them the first time around, now's your chance to re-add them to your team.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update comes after the announcement of two brand new HoYoverse games, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cutesy cosmic life sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">Petit Planet</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting auto-chess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Version Luna II update launches on October 22nd. The game is available to <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices, but bear in mind that support for the PS4 version <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">is ending next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greenheart Games has finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, so it looks like the game is about to see the light of day after eleven (!) years of development.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>will be launching into Early Access on PC on November 3rd. The game was originally slated to hit Early Access last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tavern-keeper-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 to iron out bugs</a>.</p>

<p>If you've yet to try out&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>'s demo, you can also take a look at an updated demo right now. It lets you loose on a chunk of the game's "interactive storytelling", according to Greenheart Games, as well as giving you a look at the Item Workshop and Freeplay features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-early-access-release-date-pub.jpg?itok=syvNDwv5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-early-access-release-date-pub.jpg?itok=DQm473X3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date is almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>Greenheart director and co-founder Patrick Klug says his studio is finally "ready to open the doors" to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>following eleven years of development, and that he's "thrilled" the game is finally about to let players experience its cozy atmosphere and management gameplay.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>, well, it's one of those games for which the name rather says it all. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greenheart-games-announces-tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2016</a>, it's a tavern management sim that lets you run your very own inn "in a humorous fantasy world".</p>

<p>You can decide whether you want to delve deep into the game's management systems or "simply relax and decorate" to your heart's content, and you'll also experience a story unfolding within the walls of your tavern.</p>

<p>To commemorate the release date announcement, Greenheart Games has also released a brand new trailer that should give you a sense of what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. You can check that trailer out right here.</p>






<p><em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on November 3rd. There's no word on other platforms yet, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>When you read this, the Chicago Cubs will have either tied up their series with the Milwaukee Brewers or start turning the page to a strange offseason.</em></p><p><em>Expectations for the Cubs weren't great to start the season. Then, right as things kick off, their best pitcher—one of the best in baseball—goes out for the season. What exactly is the point of watching, then? Well, because anything can happen.</em></p><p><em>Anything and everything did happen for the Cubs, too. They were, at one point, the best team in baseball. It both was, and wasn't, a mirage. Where they've ended up—fighting to advance in the playoff, struggling on offense, rotating through pitchers too quickly because they can't keep up—is where I expected them to be, really.</em></p><p><em>And yet, there's one at least more goddamn game. What's better than that? There's a little bit of "anything can happen" with the NFL right now, too, which Rob and Patrick spent trying to figure out. </em></p><p><em>Or, well, not figure out.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob</strong>: Patrick, I’m not sure I know what to do with myself in a world where the Chiefs and the Ravens have become mediocre teams and the Jaguars are suddenly decent.</p><p>I’ve found this season of football more disorienting than most, in part because it’s highlighting how much I’ve relied on teams’ reputation to frame my expectations and understanding of the league as a whole. For <em>years </em>I’ve been able to half-follow the regular season knowing that there were a couple teams who would probably be making it to a conference championship game or at the very least would be a tough divisional round opponent. Likewise, there were teams I just didn't need to think about. The Jags? A punch-line on <em>The Good Place </em>and personified by a Football Fabio underperforming expectations every season. The Steelers? Almost religiously average, a team built to clear the bar of a .500 record and no more. Whatever happens, Mahomes will pull out the necessary wins. The Ravens will be excellent. The Bills will look unstoppable at times. The NFC would continue to exist, its fate mostly dependent on whether it was a “bones” or “no bones” year for the Eagles.</p><p>In my head, the Chiefs dynasty is still young and Mahomes, Jackson, and Allen are cutting-edge quarterbacks, not guys approaching the end of their first decade as starters. Likewise, I’ve <em>never </em>had to think about perpetual losers like the Jaguars. I only have one space in my heart for a team like that, and it’s filled by the Bears.</p><p>And I think what I’m realizing is I <em>liked </em>being able to just delete a half dozen of the NFL’s 32 teams from my consciousness entirely, and place another three or four of those teams on a shelf labeled “Save for the Playoffs”. This year, however, I feel like I’m following a Bizarro World NFL where the uniforms are all the same (except for those godawful Rivalry jerseys) but everything else is different or opposite to how I remember it. Now, to know what is going on in the NFL I need to <em>watch more games </em>and read about <em>all </em>the teams? And worst of all, apparently I need to discard prior knowledge and expectations and internalize <em>new </em>information? This is awful.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@aussiedave?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Dave Adamson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I’d say the rapidly changing landscape of the current NFL season would be a reason to inspire hope in what the Bears could accomplish, but we’re writing this less than a week away from the team being forced to head back to Washington to traumatically re-live the moment that broke them last year!</p><p>Did the Jaguars win that game or did the Chiefs toss it away? Are the Bills showing weakness or did the Patriots simply take advantage of a misstep game? Are the Ravens actually bad or do they have the worst injury luck in football? Some of what makes football magical is that it doesn’t fucking matter! You have to prove competence over and over and over again in sports like basketball and baseball, which itself is part of what makes <em>those </em>sports statistically delightful over the course of a long season. But one of the reasons football is my preferred sport is specifically because it’s hard to tell if a mirage is a mirage, but at the end of the day, a win is a win and losing a single game in the NFL can be hard to come back from.</p><p>Do you think Jaguars fans give a shit if what’s playing out is real? I sure as hell didn’t in 2018, when the Bears put together their best season since 2005. I lapped up every strange victory, every defensive touchdown, because it was my one shot at feeling joy and hope—feelings <em>we</em> do not have very often.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over 250 developers at <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><em>MindsEye</em> maker</a> Build A Rocket Boy were laid off earlier this year following the AAA open-world shooter’s disastrous launch. Now, over 90 current and former staff have signed an open letter blasting the studio’s management, including founder and long-time <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ioi-hitman-everywhere-mmo-1851673924"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em>&nbsp;producer Leslie Benzies</a>, over what they claim were poor working conditions and a chaotic layoff process that allegedly broke the law. “The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand,” ex-employee Ben Newbon wrote in a statement.</p> <p>Published by<em> Hitman</em> maker IO Interactive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><em>MindsEye</em> launched in early June</a> and was immediately met by harsh criticism from players, streamers, and reviewers. It was pitched as the first building block in the well-funded studio’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">ambitious user-generated metaverse MMO</a> called <em>Everything</em>. In reality, it was hard to see it being the start of anything but painful cuts for the new startup studio with offices dotted around Europe. Mass layoffs, first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, immediately followed. According to the open letter, organized by Britain’s IWGB Union trade group, over 250 developers at the company were eventually swept up into its hasty and chaotic layoff process despite having been allegedly forced to work mandatory overtime in the four months leading up to launch.</p>

 <p>“This week, members of the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union are filing multiple legal actions against BARB, claiming failure to carry out fair consultation ahead of redundancies as well as multiple cases of unfair dismissal,” the trade group announced on October 10. “In an open letter&nbsp;to BARB leadership, employees describe a record of&nbsp;systemic mistreatment, mismanagement, and mishandling of the redundancy process.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter, condemning the way in which they’ve been mistreated and discarded by the studio’s millionaire executives. <a href="https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd">https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd</a> <a href="https://t.co/bOOHaQEakQ">pic.twitter.com/bOOHaQEakQ</a></p> <p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Concerns outlined in the letter include poor transparency and communication, extended crunch, and a “disastrous” handling of the layoff process. The current and former developers who signed it are calling for a public apology, the option for staff who haven’t hit their layoff date to take payment for it without working, a promise to use professional partners outside the studio for any future layoffs, and a “documented effort” to improve working conditions, including acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union for the studio.</p>

 <p>“Many fantastic, hard-working developers have felt used and discarded, while public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions,” <em>MindsEye</em> audio engineer Isaac Hudd said in a statement. “A pattern of poor decisions from senior management has led to a disappointing launch and ongoing challenges for both players and employees.”</p>

 <p>Despite a concerning swirl of exiting executives and broken promises at launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> over the summer that <em>MindsEye</em> director Benzies, who worked on <em>GTA</em> at Rockstar Games for over a decade, blamed the studio’s troubles on internal and external saboteurs hoping for Build a Rocket Boy’s failure. “The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful,” Ben Newborn, former lead games analyst at the studio, said in a statement. “Even before the disastrous launch of<em> MindsEye</em>, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout.”</p> <p>He continued, “Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game’s failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 To Release In 2027, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps6-to-release-in-2027-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1321765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of the PlayStation 6 (PS6) is only two years away. That, according to a known gaming hardware leaker.</p>



<p>After a recent video featuring PlayStation’s Mark Cerny and AMD’s Jack Huynh was posted, discussing the future of technology between the two parties, questions began to mount about when the next PlayStation console would be released. On the discussion forum <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/page-4#post-270885018">NeoGAF</a>, a user mentioned 2027 being “on the table” for the new system. That led to KeplerL2, who’s been accurate with hardware information in the past, to chime in.</p>



<p><strong>“Not just on the table,”</strong> they said, <strong>“it’s the plan unless any unexpected delays happen.”</strong></p>



<p>A 2027 release date shouldn’t surprise too many people. Rumors have long suggested that Sony’s next-gen console is expected in either late 2027 or early 2028. As far as what to expect from the system, there have been claims that Sony is planning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a standard</a> PS6 along <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a dockable</a> PS6 handheld. </p>



<p>Rumored specs for the PS6 include 40-48 RDNA 5 compute units, 160W TBP, 8 x Zen 6 Cores, a 160- or 192-bit memory bus, and backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, among others.</p>



<p>As with any claim like this, please take the information with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can independently verify the plans or Sony confirms them itself.</p>



<p>Do you believe the release of the PS6 will happen sometime in 2027, or will it be later? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tavern-keeper/">Tavern Keeper</a> developer Greenheart Games has officially announced that its fantasy-themed business simulator will be launching in Steam Early Access on November 3. A follow-up to Game Dev Tycoon, Greenheart Games is celebrating the development milestone with a new trailer for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/" rel="nofollow ">and an updated demo</a> that has gone live ahead of the October edition of Steam Next Fest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjqNMKF13q4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IjqNMKF13q4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Similar to management games like Two-Point Hospital, Tavern Keeper is all about running your very own inn and dealing with the challenges of the service industry within its fantasy setting. The game mixes light humor with an in-depth simulation mode that allows you to tweak your establishment's design to a high degree, as well as detailed decorative elements in its sandbox mode that allow you to create everything from bustling taprooms to relaxing reading corners.</p><p>Tavern Keeper also offers a campaign narrated by English actor Steven Pacey, and this part of the game will see players build taverns across several varied challenges. Each region will offer its own challenges, fantasy cultures, and stories.</p><p>As mentioned above, Steam Next Fest kicks off on October 13. This new edition of the week-long event will once again offer demos for unreleased games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-the-next-steam-sale-date/1100-6532422/" data-ref-id="1100-6532422">Other big Steam promotions</a> scheduled for this year include Steam Scream (October 27 - November 3), Animal Fest (November 10-17), Sports Fest (December 8-15), and the Steam Winter Sale will start on December 18.</p>
