            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Konami and developer Studio Far Out Games have revealed the release date for chaotic delivery-based action game&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, and it's coming later in spring.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs" rel="nofollow">in September last year</a>, is coming to PC and current-gen consoles on May 22nd. The game will be available across three different storefronts on PC.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is an isometric action game in which you play as courier Winston Green at the tail end of the 1950s. It's your job to deliver "highly unconventional cargo" while also leaving "a trail of havoc and chaos" behind you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=KVvITghD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=qhiyDCXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>has a release date, and it's coming in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>Set against a backdrop of what Konami and Studio Far Out call "a time of rock'n'roll, polka dot dresses and the ever-looming dread of nuclear annihilation",&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>tasks you with making "bizarre deliveries" across a series of "highly destructible environments".</p>

<p>Of course, the packages you're delivering aren't just nondescript brown paper parcels; you'll be doing everything from "delivering a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of "a big bomb teetering on the edge of explosion".</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' levels is a semi-open environment full of things to do, and you'll discover a "story of mystery and intrigue" as you explore them as well. Konami and Studio Far Out are promising a three-act narrative with "a cast of distinct and memorable characters".</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>will also feature an immersive 50s environment with its own built-in radio ads and soundtrack, helping to give you that authentic late-50s feeling.</p>




<p>You're in luck this year if you're looking for delivery games that aren't actually about deliveries. Not only is&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>coming in May, but Hideo Kojima recently revealed that his own <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</i>is set for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release in June</a>, appropriate given Konami is his former employer.</p>

<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deliver-at-all-costs/9pmwkz7ftnp0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 22nd, and pre-orders for the game are open right now.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars is on its way. Unfortunately, if you’re looking for this to be a fully-fledged Cyberpunk 2077 game, rein in your hopes and expectations now. Turf Wars is an Arcade-Machine Shooter made by LAI Games and looks like a great way to spend a few Eurodollars.</p>



<p>The resurrection of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-10-cyberpunk-2077-mods-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> needs to be studied. Not only did CD Projekt Red spend hard hours fixing and improving upon the original release, but the Phantom Liberty DLC blew us all out of the water. Cyberpunk 2077’s legacy can now be seen positively, but we know CD Projekt Red has turned its attention to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-the-witcher-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a>.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean we aren’t getting new Cyberpunk 2077 media though—so say hello to Turf Wars.</p>



<h2 id="h-cyberpunk-2077-turf-wars-is-a-new-cd-projekt-red-approved-arcade-shooter">Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars is a New CD Projekt Red-Approved Arcade Shooter</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Judy has probably ridden off into the sunset for good. Credit to CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars was announced and shown to the world on March 12. A Cyberpunk-inspired YouTube video revealed the new “Next-Gen Futuristic Tactile Shooter”. Sadly, yes, it’s a <strong>classic Arcade cabinet</strong> you’re encouraged to dump a ton of money into.</p>



<p>However, it looks incredible. LAI Games promise immersive features from “projection mapping technology” to “advanced haptic feedback and a pulse-pounding soundtrack.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full trailer for the Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars cabinet below thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LAIGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LAI Games</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars is officially endorsed and licensed by CD Projekt Red and offers “Story Mode, Co-Op/Versus, and Sniper Mode.” It looks to be a sophisticated piece of technology. Who knows, if Turf Wars is a success, it could make the jump to consoles and other platforms à la Time Crisis, House of the Dead, and Point Blank.</p>



<p>It should keep us all ticking over until the real <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-is-working-on-the-most-realistic-and-reactive-crowd-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> at least. If you’re worried about The Witcher 4 though, you don’t need to as CD Projekt Red has promised <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4 launch won’t be another Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed Digimon Alysion, a free-to-play online card game arriving for iOS and Android devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-a-surprise-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that Digimon was also receiving a TCG Pocket competitor, and thanks to Digimon Con (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/free-to-play-online-card-game-digimon-alysion-announced-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), we have finally learned about the game. Digimon Alysion brings the card game experience straight to players’ smartphones. Not much is known about the game; however, the trailer has provided some glimpses about what to expect from the free-to-play title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Digimon Alysion trailer begins by showcasing the basics of a trading card game experience, including card collection and battle features. However, the players are teased with a narrative element towards the halfway mark. The trailer also reveals brand-new characters for the franchise, including Kanata Hondo, Futre, and Valner Dragnogh. There’s also a brand new Digimon called Gemmon featured in the trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="《公式》スマートフォン向けアプリ『デジモンアリシオン』プロジェクト始動PV　|《Official》New Digimon Card Game app &quot;DIGIMON ALYSION&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JaoHerGig5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Digimon Alysion doesn’t have a release date at the moment. However, a closed beta is in the works; its details will be revealed shortly. Players should also expect new Digimon and characters to appear in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket already has a new competitor in less than 6 months of release, and it is fitting to see Digimon, their decades-old rival, enter the space. TCG Pocket pulled in some unbelievable numbers during its release, getting over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> in 9 days and earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> in the first seventeen. It’ll be interesting to see how Digimon Alysion compares when it releases.</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO x Pokemon</a> partnership has been officially announced. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/niantic-says-pokemon-go-location-data-wont-be-given-to-saudi-arabia-government/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niantic has said</a> Pokemon GO location data won’t be provided to the Saudi Arabian government.

And as a reward for the first players who made it through Laser Hell together, Hazelight Studios is flying them to Sweden to see its next game.</p><p><em>Spoilers for accessing the secret level to follow.</em></p><p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/split-fiction-players-crack-fiendish-laser-hell-challenge-earn-invitation-to-see-hazelights-next-game/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Laser Hell opens itself up in the Isolation level after players enter the correct sequence of switch presses while on the elevator.

He also invited the first fans to complete Laser Hell to the studio's headquarters in Sweden to see Hazelight's next game, which is still in development. Fares later congratulated sharkOvO and E1uM4y on social media and confirmed that they had earned their trip before promising to reach out.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Congrats to ”sharkOvO” and ”E1uM4y” for finishing the secret challenge ”Laser Hell” in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#splitficton</a>.

But while you're here, let me take the opportunity to shout out some specific plugins we made heavy use of: Super Text Mesh is how we got all the bouncy animated text in there, Rewired was an indispensable tool for setting up the gamepad controls, and (this one is kinda obscure) "Advanced Event" by ByteSheep Digital was an essential building block for making various editor tools we used throughout development.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> turns food and calorie counting into an array of minigames meant to simulate the challenges around dieting and how it can reshape your perception of food. Can you tell us about your process in taking these thoughts around dieting and food and turning them into a minigame? Can you walk us through this process for the design of one of the specific minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Jenny’s dieting is something that places pressure on her life in a multitude of ways and we wanted that represented properly in the game. Key to that is that there’s more than one way to “fail” at dieting: you can eat too much, overshooting your calorie budget, or you can eat too little (or in a way that’s “unsatisfying”) and end up hungry, OR you can counterintuitively do BOTH of those things at the same time. Additionally, eating is something you generally do everyday, so we needed to have a reusable mini game that wouldn’t get old too quickly. The resulting “food </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” mini game mostly emerged from trying to reconcile all those constraints. Each food puzzle piece gets a fake calorie value, but that’s unrelated to how it impacts hunger and craving (which is ultimately determined by the shape of the food) allowing for the aforementioned multitude of outcomes. Anyway, we had to iterate on it a ton before we arrived at the current design [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>laughs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">].&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> explores the ways in which dieting attempts to turn food into a mechanical, countable process despite many difficult-to control needs and feelings within the human body. What thoughts went into capturing this battle with the self within the gameplay and the player's limited controls within the minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">There’s definitely a balance between what the player can control vs not control, but more than that, there’s a distinct contrast between systems the player is aware of (i.e. the fake calorie counting system, how hungry Jenny is) and systems that are hidden from the player. We ultimately wanted to trick the player into behaving like teenage Jenny by limiting information in this way. A lot of the hidden systems are built around the “random encounters”. Basically, the way these work is that there’s a big deck of event cards and when the player gets a random encounter it just draws a card randomly from this deck. But actions the player takes can secretly add or remove cards from this deck. For instance, if Jenny goes to bed hungry (with her guts at &lt; 50%), it’ll add a “snack attack” event to the deck where, if it gets drawn, Jenny gives into her craving and eats a big snack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Food-based games are not the entire experience as players must also carry out the protagonist's life and duties as well. What thoughts went into crafting the narrative and turning the main character's various activities into other minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dieting doesn’t end the moment you’re done with lunch. We wanted to explore the ways dieting overlaps with other aspects of Jenny’s life (how she balances it with school work, social obligations, keeping her mom off her back, etc.). To do that, we basically had to simulate the rest of Jenny’s life [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>laughs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]. But even beyond that. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn’t just about the ways dieting “Consumes” Jenny’s life, it’s about how she jumps from obsession to obsession, piling more onto her plate with each chapter, following an arc similar to the one she followed in real life, so all the non-dieting parts of the game become more and more essential as the story proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to the game's art style? What appealed to you about creating something playful and animated around this serious subject?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The current art style is basically the same art style I used to prototype the original mini-games. Back then, I basically tried to keep the decision-making simple: pick a limited color palette, the pencil tool in Photoshop, a few brush sizes. What mattered to me back then was getting the prototype working so I didn’t have a lot of time to focus on the art side. As I continued developing the game, the look of the art changed, too. I think most artists would agree that as they evolve themselves, so does their art style.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Kelly joined the project to help me out on backgrounds it was a really fun opportunity to see what they could do with my guidelines from the prototyping phase. Since this game has been in development for many years, you can see how the character is drawn in many different styles. It’s hard to stick to 1 style without feeling the need to redo it and I guess we just left my old art in the game alongside the new art styles. I also like to joke that the art looks like it had been made by a whole team of like 20 people when really it’s just 2 artists who have worked on the project for a number of years whose art styles constantly evolved and who felt too lazy to redo the old scenes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, why was it important to you to explore dieting in a darkly humorous way? What benefits and challenges came from looking at this subject with bleak humor?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Life’s depressing. Especially right now. Lots of things look hopeless. Don’t you want to laugh a little and make some jokes before you die? &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is actually one of my pet takes. Basically, I think art that’s completely devoid of humour is also incapable of being serious. Now I don’t mean that everything should be a comedy, exactly, but more that “humor” as “emotional lightness” contrasted with “emotional heaviness” is a really important part of the texture of any narrative. My go-to example here is that even Shakespeare’s famous tragedies (e.g. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hamlet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are suffused with humor throughout even if they aren’t “comedies.” Which is just to say, when making something about a serious subject, finding humor somewhere is a very important part of telling a “real” story, for whatever that’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The itch.io store page for this game mentions that this game came about from personal experiences with dieting and disordered eating. What difficulties did you face in exploring these memories and feelings while creating the game? Did you feel that creating art around these experiences has helped you or affected you in any way? Do you have any concerns about how this game may affect others who play it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I got more emotional rereading my diary entries about my high school relationship and failing my classes in freshman year than I did about the dieting stuff. I actually feel like, as we expanded the game’s scope, formed an actual team, and turned this personal project into an actual video game, I became less attached to it, emotionally. Regarding my concerns about the subject matter, I don’t want my experiences to trigger other people who are in a bad mental space with food and how they see their body, so we put a content warning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We were definitely concerned about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being triggering or upsetting for anyone with a history of disordered eating. For that reason, we put a pretty hefty content warning at the front of the game. We also attempted a few maneuvers to detach it from “real” dieting and disordered eating while still evoking the feeling of those things (Stuff like removing specific weight numbers from the game and replacing “calories” with a fictional unit of energy called “Bites”). That said, we’re well aware that these interventions are insufficient for at least some portion of the audience, so we absolutely won’t begrudge anyone for giving it a pass!&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has quietly updated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> with a day one patch that includes changes to how players can interact with objects within the game's shrine locations. 
</p>
<p>
The change is minor, but notable as it follows attention on the game raised by Japanese politician Hiroyuki Kada, who was upset at preview footage of the game featuring a player crashing around a local shrine within Shadows (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible">IGN</a>).
</p>
<p>
At launch, major items in Shadows' shrines are no longer destructible. Ubisoft appears to have released the patch alongside the game's release last night, meaning players will already have it installed.

<p>
Yesterday, Kada flagged the situation again, to get a response from the country's prime minister. The following exchange comes via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on">IGN</a>, with translation by IGN Japan colleagues.
</p>
<p>
"I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life," Kada said. "Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided."
</p>
<p>
According to IGN Japan staff, the context to Kada's comments is that Japan has seen record tourism since the country's post-lockdown reopening, and wider concern of "over tourism" that has sparked a rise in vandalism. Kada's concern is that Shadows players who have played the game might try and recreate its violence in real-life.
</p>
<p>
"Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself," Japanese prime minster Ishiba said yesterday, in a response to Kada. "When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them."
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch day patch includes a small list of fixes previously flagged as arriving on day one.
</p>
<p>
If you're playing Shadows already, you likely have this patch installed. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it will not be highlighting the patch publicly beyond confirming the below notes are accurate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Players no longer getting stuck inside movable objects after dodging forward and interacting with them in kofuns</li>
<li>Fix for procedural weapons being removed incorrectly when selling items</li>
<li>Adjustments to prevent players from going out of bounds when proning against objects</li>
<li>Improved horse navigation, reducing issues with turning and blocked paths</li>
<li>Lighting adjustments for cave, kofun, and architectural entrances/exits</li>
<li>Fixes for cloth clipping on Yasuke's outfits (while riding) and Naoe's outfits (while crouching)</li>
<li>Citizens without weapons no longer bleed when attacked, reducing unintended blood spill in temples/shrines</li>
<li>Tables and racks in temples/shrines are now indestructible (Some objects like drums or bowls can still be broken as they are generic ones present everywhere in the world) (Tables are still dynamic objects, so players can still move/push them).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a lightning rod for controversy over its road to release, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-statue-pulled-as-company-behind-it-acknowledges-insensitive-design">reworked figurine with an initially "insensitive" design</a>, and gripes over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">historical inaccuracies in concept art within a collector's art book</a>. </p>
<p>There has also been an ongoing backlash to Yasuke's presence and role in Shadows, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">caught the attention of Elon Musk</a>.

			<p>The recently released Half-Life 2 RTX demo is not only a great showcase of the potential of NVIDIA RTX Remix but also of the DirectX 12 Ultimate Sampler Feedback feature, which has the potential to be quite a game-changer in terms of VRAM usage.</p>
<p>A new video shared earlier this week on YouTube by Compusemble shows Sampler Feedback streaming in action in the demo, showing how the technology can significantly reduce VRAM usage in pretty much every scenario. While the reduced VRAM usage doesn't lead to any significant performance improvement, the technology is definitely impressive and could definitely help improve image quality and performance in games running on GPUs with low VRAM capacity.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 2 RTX is an amazing showcase of what can be achieved using NVIDIA's RTX Remix, although the quality of the transformative upgrade is impacted by the change in the atmosphere of the original game. You can learn more about the demo by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/">piece.</a></p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 RTX boasts amazingly remade assets that show outstanding fidelity even when zoomed upon. In this regard, the team at Orbifold has done incredible work so far. And then, of course, there's the path tracing, boosted by RTXDI and Neural Radiance Cache. The game is completely transformed with them, almost entirely for the better, with bounce lights and indirect lighting illuminating everything they should and bringing the environments to life.</em></p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 RTX demo is now available for download for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>

The gaming-focused voice and chat app announced that a mobile pilot for Video Quests — ads that allow Discord users to earn rewards like avatar decorations and in-game items by watching a video — will launch in June 2025, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/30/24116761/discords-sponsored-quests-are-coming-next-week">rolling out on PC and consoles last year</a>.</p><p>”Expanding our advertising platform to mobile is an obvious, natural evolution in our strategy,” said Discord’s product leader, Peter Sellis. “Our mission is to create the most authentic, player-centric advertising platform in the galaxy. This expansion will provide brand partners access to Discord’s highly engaged, cross-platform mobile audience — and create new opportunities for businesses to connect with our community in meaningful, and performant, ways.”</p><p>The new mobile ads don’t seem particularly intrusive — they will appear as a “Quest bar” at the bottom of the screen, which can be dismissed or tapped on to open the dedicated Quest tab. The full-screen videos will only then play if a user chooses to accept the Quest.</p><p>Discord already allows users on other platforms to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5FZ4PEXTW08Q4RYP41">hide in-app promotions for specific Quests</a>, or opt out of personalized promotions. These options will also be available for mobile users.</p><p>Video Quests are one of two Quest formats that Discord launched last year, the other being Play Quests, which reward players for completing in-game tasks. Discord had gained a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/01/983159051/why-does-discord-not-use-ads-and-why-is-microsoft-interested-we-asked-discords-c">reputation for being an ad-free platform</a> prior to introducing Quests, having instead relied on user subscriptions to bring in revenue. Mobile Quest ads were already being tested in a limited beta, but this rollout suggests they will now start appearing more broadly.</p><p>The announcement of mobile ads comes amid rumors that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/discord-ipo.html">Discord is preparing to launch an initial public offering</a>. The company was last valued at roughly $15 billion by private investors in 2021, and had reportedly discussed a $10 billion acquisition deal with Microsoft that same year that ultimately didn’t materialize anything.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 20th:</strong> added confirmation about ad settings for mobile users.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Kada, who will campaign for re-election this summer, said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life. Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Ishiba responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How to address this legally is something we need to discuss with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine being “defaced” in pre-release Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay videos is Itatehyozu Shrine in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is within Kada’s constituency. He said that he had consulted with representatives of the shrine, who confirmed that Ubisoft did not seek their permission to show the shrine and use its name in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Masaki Ogushi (Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry) responded that government agencies will work together to handle matters “if the shrine seeks consultation,” in a work of artistic expression Ubisoft would probably be clear legally to use the shrine under the Constitution of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses from both ministers were vague at best and seem unlikely to result in any particular action, especially as Ubisoft appears to have addressed these concerns proactively with this day-one patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Irrespective of the game’s success or otherwise in Japan, there is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You might not like it, but God has decided you need to spend the afterlife down in the pits of Hell. In fact, you don’t like it. You don’t like it so much that you’re going to fight back and break your way back out. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t, really. Even so, that would be a pretty daunting task if you were on your own, but thankfully there’s literally dozens of you fighting for the exact same thing in 33 Immortals.</p>
<p><iframe title="33 Immortals - Launch Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aypaB0voAWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now out in Early Access and Game Preview (with Xbox Game Pass), <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/33-immortals">33 Immortals</a> should not be confused with that other game with a 33 in the title. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is the JRPG, while 33 Immortals is a large scale co-op roguelike. You’d be forgiven for getting the names muddled up, though.</p>


<p>But what does a 33-player game actually look like? We’re mostly familiar with what a co-op action RPG looks like, and 33 Immortals generally looks like this kind of game, but the Diablos of this world typically keep you reigned in with four-player co-op, often playing with your friends and gabbing away as you do so. The closest parallel, and the stated desire from Thunder Lotus, is instead to capture the feel of an MMO raid, with the likes of World of Warcraft allowing parties of up to 30 to go together. As hinted by the name, the main mode in 33 Immortals sends 33 of you out into the Inferno to battle side-by-side. Sometimes.</p>


<p>You see, you’re not all spawned into the world together, but instead will appear in smaller groups that engender greater cooperation through the early part of a run. There’s a loose herd mentality of wanting to stick together to dispatch enemies more quickly, and then to delve into the Torture Chambers that are unlocked for you. These are challenge rooms that are limited to six players, with multiple Chambers opening up across the map, all of them needing to be completed to trigger the next stage of the run.</p>
<p>A stage-wide bombardment of flame attacks signals that, while golden rings surround your screen –&nbsp;no doubt a manifestation of God’s wrath –&nbsp;before fresh enemies spawn into the overworld and the next set of Chambers opens up. Completing Chambers is key to increasing your power, as they unlock one or two chests for you, filled with crystals and giving a stat-boosting Relic to marginally improve your stats. Each enemy defeated also drops purple ores that fill a meter until you can redeem them at a pedestal for a boost to damage, health or Empathy, which boosts your co-op.</p>
<p>It all builds up to a climactic battle against the three-headed ruler of this realm, though you first all need to gather at an ascension point and battle in a constricted arena to prove yourself worthy of this. Lucifer is a fascinating style of boss. Now with all the surviving players gathered together, the balancing act of damage and sponginess shifts. He actually has a whopping ten health bars for you to whittle away, while he summons mid-bosses and engages certain abilities that will wipe out swathes of your team if you don’t react quickly enough. One requires that you destroy his glowing bracelets, while another spawns seriously spongey crystals all across the map, needing you to destroy them all to even give yourself half an opening.</p>

<p>You don’t need to completely defeat him, though, as each health bar you chip away awards resources and keys to access the other levels –&nbsp;a 22-player Purgatorio stage that will up the ante. Each player can be revived once, returning with a fraction of their health and then their second failure ending their act of rebellion.</p>
<p>With so many players, roles are necessarily quite loose and generic. There’s four different weapons that define your character archetype. The Bow of Hope is what you start with through the opening tutorial, firing up to 6 arrows that then stay in place until you summon them back to your quiver, dealing damage to anything they pass through on the return trip. There’s more nuance to each of the others. The Sword of Justice is the tank, building up Justice points with every strike that are then quickly expended when blocking. The Daggers of Greed build up to let you perform a leaping attack, while the Staff of Sloth sends slowly arcing balls that slow enemies they hit, and can then push out a wider wave of slowing.</p>

<p>Each also has a special ability –&nbsp;the bow gives a volley of arrows for a few seconds, Sword provides bubble shields to allies, daggers let you and an ally get enemies to drop bones when hit, and the staff creates a super slow zone blanket that envelopes a patch of the screen. The unique trick here is that each ability requires one or two allies to come and stand in a rough formation in order to trigger it. That’s much easier said than done during the busiest battles.</p>
<p>I personally leant toward the Bow of Hope – it’s the first weapon I tried and I easily get set in my ways – letting me keep my distance and engage in more strategic positioning than with the daggers, but I inevitably felt quite underpowered when reaching the crystals stage of the battle with Lucifer.</p>
<p>Wrapped around this is a gradual roguelike progression system, pushing you to complete tasks, level up weapons, discover a gallery of relics that can boost you on the next run. It’s solid, if unremarkable while you’re trying to settle in on which weapon you prefer and start to focus your efforts around it – or you’ll probably want to save up and buy a pet companion to run around with you. Each return to the Dark Woods that is the pre-expedition hub sees half a dozen characters and vendors vying for your attention, the main one, and the architect of this general rebellion, being Beatrice.</p>

<p>There’s an engaging core to 33 Immortals, a minimalist tone to the combat that lets you focus on your one job while still working in tandem with allies nearby, and it builds up to a fever pitch as you ascend to the battle at the end of a run. There’s more to come for this game, with Thunder Lotus keeping the 11-player raid under wraps, but with just a few runs under my belt, I can easily see this becoming my go-to game for a medium pressure, medium length blast when I’ve got an hour to kill.</p>

			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has a hidden 60 FPS mode, which suggests the recent game may have been future-proofed ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>As confirmed by known modder MasaGrator, this 60 FPS mode is hidden in the game's executable but doesn't function properly, as enabling it causes some unspecified issues. While this mode could be some development leftover, it would definitely make more sense if its faulty implementation could be the basis upon which a Nintendo Switch 2 patch for the game could be built to allow the game to take advantage of the console's additional power and deliver a 60 FPS experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">About Xenoblade Chronicles X:<br>
- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked<br>
- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1 <a href="https://t.co/Ag09YVQ7g1">pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1</a></p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is the best way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to the improved UI, streamlined mechanics and new content, though the presentation could have been polished a little more. You can learn more about the game in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition brings one of Nintendo’s best open worlds to a new audience with confidence, offering up much-improved UI, smartly-streamlined mechanics, and some intriguing new content. While the game’s presentation could perhaps use a touch more polish, the game is an out-of-this-world Switch RPG worth experiencing before Nintendo launches its next hardware.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is now available on Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

<p>Capcom is looking to reward loyal Monster Hunter Wilds players by offering tempting in-game goodies such as Lifepowder and Silver Eggs in return for linking their Capcom ID. </p>



<p>Aptly, there are a ton of wild gaming promotions left, right, and center. You only have to look at Call of Duty giving out rewards like there’s no tomorrow for crossovers with Mountain Dew, Dominos, Little Caesers, and much more every year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mcdonalds-promotion-happy-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pocket offered goodies for buying Happy Meals</a> too. But Capcom has a much simpler ask of its Monster Hunter Wilds players who’ve helped make the game the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling in Capcom history</a>.</p>



<p>Link your Capcom ID—or register for one if you haven’t already—and your in-game journey can become even more fruitful.</p>







<figure><figcaption>You need all the help you can get. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>No matter how many hours you’ve put into Monster Hunter Wilds, free bonuses are always welcome. <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1902676875337465962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom says on X</a>: “Got a CAPCOM ID account? Linking it to the platform you play Monster Hunter Wilds on will <strong>unlock an item pack for you in-game</strong> that’s stocked with useful items!”</p>



<p>But what are these free items you ask? I’ll tell you:</p>



<ul>
<li>Armor Sphere × 10</li>



<li>Demon Powder × 5</li>



<li>Hardshell Powder × 5</li>



<li>Herbal Powder × 5</li>



<li>Lifepowder × 10</li>



<li>Mega Potion × 30</li>



<li>Silver Egg × 1</li>



<li>Well-done Steak × 10</li>
</ul>



<p>They all come as part of a juicy item pack you can claim in Monster Hunter Wilds. If you’ve never registered a Capcom ID before, the <a href="https://cid.capcom.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">registration process</a> is very simple. <strong>The items can be claimed in-game from the Support Desk.</strong></p>



<div><article><p><span>Got a CAPCOM ID account? Linking it to the platform you play Monster Hunter Wilds on will unlock an item pack for you in-game that’s stocked with useful items!

Not made your account yet? No worries, it’s quick, free and used in various Capcom services: </span><a href="http://monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/pr…</a></p></article></div>



<p>Capcom also points out that if you’ve already registered your Capcom ID, you’re still eligible for the goodies. It’s a win-win all around and rewards the millions of players already getting stuck into monster-slaying action—chasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gravid-bowfin-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gravid Bowfins</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tracktail-lizard-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracktail Lizards</a>.</p>

                <p>They say diamonds are forever, but Nintendo 3DS game carts might be ready to give that precious material a run for its money. One Pokemon Sun player discovered just how durable the 3DS cart for the game was, as after it appeared to be lost for several years, they located it in their yard and found that it still worked fine.</p><p>"I was cleaning outside and I found this, it's my copy of Pokemon Sun from middle school,” user Lzzz4 shared on the Pokemon Sun and Moon subreddit (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/nintendo-3ds-6-years-332065/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-cartridge-3ds-lost-alolan-raichu-rowlet-1851770957" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>). "Last time [it] saved [was] November 7, 2018, that's probably around the time I lost it, that means its been outside for about six years and it still works."</p><hr><hr><p>While the cartridge did show some obvious signs of wear and tear from being outside for seven years--and the game label was missing--the original save data was still present. Lzzz4's team of Pokemon were ready to resume their journey in the Alolan region, and with over 100 hours logged in the game, they had amassed quite the collection of pocket monsters.</p><p>After a long break, the next big entry in the Pokemon franchise will be out later this year.

            <p>McDonald's is offering its customers the chance to purchase a £8.19 Minecraft Movie Meal as part of its promotion for the upcoming film, complete with "amazing collectibles" crafted for adults.</p>
<p>Those interested in sampling McDonald's upcoming movie meal - which will be available from Wednesday, 26th March - can choose from a Big Mac, nine Chicken McNuggets, or four Veggie Dippers. Then, to obviously make this into a meal, there will be a side and drink of choice. Now, this all sounds like a pretty average McDonald's meal, but it will be Minecraftified thanks to some free blocky McDonald's characters with each purchase.</p>
<p>One of six collectibles will be available with McDonald's A Minecraft Movie Meal, and they are: Grimace Egg, Zombie Hamburglar, Birdie Wings, Fry Helmet, Soda Potion and Big Mac Crystal. It's your call if this is worth £8.</p>

<p>Other Minecraft-themed offerings coming to the menu include the limited edition Nether Flame Sauce, which is a combination of crushed red pepper and flaming cayenne, "balanced" with hints of garlic and sweetness.</p>
<p>There's also an Apple Cake McFlurry, which the company is sure will "excite A Minecraft Movie and McDonald's fans across the UK" thanks to its apple and shortcake pieces topped with a sour apple sauce. The Apple Cake McFlurry will sell for £2.19, but there is also a mini version for £1.69.</p>
<p>"McDonald's is exploring a brand-new world with the A Minecraft Movie collaboration. We're always looking for fun and exciting ways to bring excitement to our menu and the A Minecraft Movie Meal is a perfect way to bring two icons together," said Senior Vice President Chief Marketing Officer at McDonald's UK and Ireland Ben Fox.</p>
<p>"This partnership has allowed us to bring amazing collectibles, crafted for adults, to the UK for the first-time ever! We can't wait for fans to meet their favourite McDonaldsland characters in blockified form, and to experience the new products which have been inspired by the A Minecraft Movie universe - Nether Sauce and Apple Cake McFlurry."</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has launched legal action against a developer it had partnered with to make a new Front Mission game.
</p>
<p>
Front Mission, the company's classic mecha battle franchise, was set to be revived by BlackJack Studio via a new game titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
After two years of development, Square Enix cancelled the project in October 2024, and walked away from BlackJack Studio for reasons unknown. Shortly after, BlackJack Studio announced its own "Front Mission-style game", known as Mecharashi.

<p>
Square Enix's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/841035863/Square-Enix-suing-to-stop-this-Front-Mission-style-mecha-game-from-being-released-in-the-US">lawsuit</a> (uncovered by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>) claims Mecharashi uses the work BlackJack Studio undertook for its own project. Indeed, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">Mecharashi's own Steam page</a> describes the game thus: 
</p>
<p>
"Mecharashi is a mecha-themed tactical turn-based game. The game adopts a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle."
</p>
<p>
Court documents filed by Square Enix include pages of screenshots comparing the unreleased Front Mission prototype made by BlackJack Studio and the developer's new project. The similarities are obvious. 
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Square Enix is seeking $150k (£115k) in compensation for copyright infringement, and an immediate removal of the game's listing from storefronts.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Mecharashi has already disappeared and reappeared from Steam as Square Enix and BlackJack Studio squabble over a DMCA notice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-best-yasuke-abilities-to-learn-first/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a pretty unique entry in the series in terms of gameplay, as it features a somewhat clear split between the stealth playstyle of classic entries in the series and the more combat-oriented style of recent games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla with its two protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. While both are pretty competent at what they do right from when they are introduced in the story, Yasuke, in particular, doesn't feel that good to play, even in combat. With some choice abilities, however, he becomes much more fun to play, so you should be looking into unlocking these abilities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you're into fighting enemies head-on, there's no better choice of protagonist than Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows, but you will often find yourself surrounded by multiple enemies. To fight multiple enemies effectively, you will want to equip a<strong> Naginata</strong> and learn the <strong>Crescent Strike</strong> ability. This Adrenaline ability is perfect to use when surrounded, as, by swinging the Naginata in a very wide arc, Yasuke knocks enemies down while also pushing them away, giving you some breathing room.</p>
<p>The second Naginata ability to learn as quickly as possible to make fights more fun and prevent things from dragging out too much is <strong>Impale</strong>. This ability can be used not only to reposition Yasuke but also to impale enemies on walls. If the enemy is still alive after the ability has been used, they will be knocked down and open for a grounded attack that is often fatal. Augmenting these abilities is the <strong>Combat Expert</strong> ability on the Long Katana Mastery skill tree, which increases damage with all melee weapons by a certain percentage each level, and the <strong>Increased Armor Damage</strong> on the Teppo Mastery skill tree, which increases armor damage by a certain percentage each level. <strong>Vigor</strong> abilities in the Samurai Mastery tree are also great skills to learn to get additional Adrenaline chunks and use these abilities more often.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250320131637_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If the Naginata is not the melee weapon you want to use in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are some Long Katana and Kanabo abilities you can learn to make them more effective and fun to use as well. The <strong>Sheathed Attack</strong> and the <strong>Sheated Posture</strong> are essential abilities to learn for the samurai's signature weapon, as a charged sheathed heavy attack on a guarding enemy has the chance to knock them down, opening them for a potentially lethal grounded attack. Even if it doesn't knock them down, a sheated posture attack is generally very strong and can kill weaker enemies if they are in a vulnerable state with a single hit.</p>
<p>The powerful Kanabo is also made better and more fun to use by two abilities, <strong>Devastation</strong> and <strong>Forward Momentum</strong>. The first unleashes a second combo ender when using a different type of attack after performing the first finisher, which is often a deadly combination against any sort of enemy. The second makes attacking much faster by pressing the next button in a combo with perfect timing, allowing Yasuke to deliver more devastating attacks more often. These two abilities synergize well with each other as well as with the <strong>Combo Ender Damage, </strong>making the Kanabo one of the strongest weapon types in the game in terms of sheer damage.</p>

Following the viral success of ‘Peaches,’ Black’s gloriously silly ditty sung as Bowser in <em>The Super Mario Bros.

Will it though?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Well, OK, probably not. Where ‘Peaches’ was inherently funny, the overwrought rendition of asinine lyrics, sung in the plaintiff voice of a lovelorn Bowser, <em>Minecraft</em>’s ‘I Feel Alive’—despite being fine--feels overwritten and, well, smells a touch of desperation. But, and it’s an important but, only in the context of the cynical exercise we can see being deployed. The song itself is competent, extremely well-performed, and could easily have been a Whitesnake B-side in the mid-80s.</p><p>See, the joke is, “rock” means both rock music <em>AND</em> a thing you use in <em>Minecraft</em>! GEDDIT? Beyond that, it’s very much an ‘80s movie credits fare, the plot of the film sung to family-friendly rock riffs, and it seems inevitable that it’ll play over the credits when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, you can totally see an enthusiastic crowd jumping up and down as they roar out the catchy chorus. Children everywhere will find the album on Spotify after they’ve seen the film and enjoy air guitar rocking out during the bridge. It’ll do its job. And, in this sense, it’s rather emblematic of the movie as a whole.</p><figure id="" data-id="f494fd31e153d7a4229b53d2a2b8aae5" data-recommend-id="image://f494fd31e153d7a4229b53d2a2b8aae5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1011" data-height="566" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jack Black as Steve in front of a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jack Black as Steve in front of a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Yet, gosh, people were rather cross. Apparently every game-related film ever made should cater exactly to each specifically entitled manbaby who might see its trailer, and any other notion is blasphemy. The greatest heresy is to point out this is a film aimed at the current generation of children who are currently propelling <em>Minecraft</em> to being one of the biggest toy and gaming franchises in the world. This is largely because each entitled manbaby has an imaginary 12-year-old nephew who thinks the trailers look <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>Anyway, the point is, <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is being met with a lot of bad faith, and it’s going to be very interesting to see how it performs heading into this storm. Obviously no one has any idea if it’s any good at this point, although it was reported <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-live-action-first-trailer-reaction-1851703382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-live-action-first-trailer-reaction-1851703382">that test screenings went well</a></span>, and indeed that the movie didn’t match the tone of that first trailer. If it’s genuinely bad, rather than that tedious movie critic faux-weariness that is so often deployed for kids’ films, then it could obviously hurt the juggernaut’s progress.</p><p>My 10-year-old is absolutely hyped for this, each following trailer deliberately spotlighting <em>Minecraft</em> memes that are currently huge on YouTube, of which you and I are completely unaware. Which again is to say, I have a strong feeling that the creators know what they’re doing here, making a movie that’s not for those of us who were passing code for the Java edition to friends in 2009, but rather the kid on the bus today wearing a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> school bag over their <em>Minecraft </em>joggers and hoodie, watching Skeppy on their phone. </p><p>And yeah, that’s inherently cynical. Much like the accompanying song. Then again, anyone holding out hope that this was ever going to be a Jim Jarmusch-like moody indie sleeper-hit was perhaps being a little naive. Anyway, here’s the far more excellent ‘Peaches.’</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is launching an industry-wide union of video game workers in North America and Canada, which it says will help "build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".
</p>
<p>
The CWA has been at the centre of many of the successful US games industry unionisation efforts over the last few years, with 2024 seeing announcements of unions at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/200-workers-at-bethesda-game-studio-have-unionised">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-team-forms-500-stong-union">Blizzard</a>. Its <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership">newly unveiled United Videogame Workers</a> (UVW-CWA) operates a little differently to a traditional certified union, however, serving as a direct-join industry-wide organisation - said to be the first of its kind for the games industry in the US.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the UVW-CWA means any freelance or full-time video game industry worker - artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, and <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">beyond</a> - can join if they're based in the US or Canada, with dues calculated on a sliding scale. And it's also open to industry musicians, having been launched in partnership with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). This, the CWA says, will help "build power across the industry without the obstacles and delays that employers can impose during the traditional union certification process".
</p>
<p>
"Our mission is to take back our lives, our labour, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs," the <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/mission-statement">UVW-CWA writes</a>. "To empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers labouring invisibly to keep this industry afloat. Our goal is to create a union... to fight the whims of CEOs and private equity vultures."
</p>
<p>
"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights," the UVW-CWA explains elsewhere, "setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organisers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labour movement."
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">accompanying FAQ</a>, the UVW-CWA continues, "Not only do we build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, we also strive to build large-scale education campaigns about labour organising in the video game industry, provide legal support and layoff support funds for disenfranchised workers, write template contract standards, build professional development and mentorship programmes within our community, and so much more." The first of the UVW-CWA's campaigns will focus on layoffs, and a petition is being shared at this week's GDC in the hope of gaining "widespread support".
</p>
<p>
The CWA's announcement comes amid a devastating few years for the games industry, marked by extensive layoffs and studio closures. Over 25000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs since the start of 2023 - and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">GDC's most recent State of the Games Industry survey</a> from earlier this year, one in 10 respondents reported being laid off in 2024.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Feudal Japan—and the country's culture in general—has been idolized and romanticized for decades, including during the early days of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. Ubisoft is finally answering the fans' longtime call with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, which brings Japan's landscape to life in painstaking detail, for better and for worse.</p>

<p>Across the nine regions in this game, I've traversed across roughly half of them, and there's an abundance of viewpoints to synchronize and take in the breathtaking scenery. And when the seasons change, the landscape meaningfully shifts in mood and tone, in ways reminiscent of an Akira Kurosawa film.</p>

<p>There's incredible attention to detail in the environment here, as to be expected in an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. But in some ways, unfortunately, that detail undermines the overall experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-spring-viewpoint.jpg?itok=xZm6WjCR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-spring-viewpoint.jpg?itok=A-y1yKyI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em>&nbsp;Open World&nbsp;Has a Mountain of Pathfinding Problems</h2>

<p>Geographically speaking, Japan is incredibly mountainous and hilly. Modern-day Japan has tunnels for the shinkansen to go through, but back in the late 1500s, when this game is set, you either climb up or go around the mountains.</p>

<p>In a game like <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, you're running from waypoint to waypoint. Some you'll see for yourself from atop a viewpoint, others you'll find on the world map using your scouts. More often than not though, running straight toward the marker doesn't work well.</p>

<p>To make it to your goal in a straight line, you'll probably have to spend a couple minutes climbing mountains, finding the exact right slopes to run up. If it's too steep, you'll slide back down—more so <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview" rel="nofollow">if you're playing as the heavy tank Yasuke</a>. Your horse has an even worse time with slopes, especially when there's lots of bushes around, so it's not worth bothering.</p>



<p>Coming down the mountain isn't as bad, as long as you're mindful of fall damage. What doesn't help though, is the amount of foliage that assaults the camera from every angle. It's difficult to parse out where you're going, and it feels like wrestling instead of running.</p>

<p>Of course, this probably isn't the intended way to play; after all, we don't have gravity-defying <em>Skyrim </em>horses. Instead, there's a setting that turns on a wayfinder, and an in-game line directs you to your destination via pre-defined paths through the mountains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following this line guarantees you'll get to your destination smoothly, but it also sort of defeats the purpose of an open world. It's a classic dilemma the genre's faced for as long as <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has been popular.</p>



<h2>Random Not-So-Random</h2>

<p>What makes things extra difficult here, though, is that exploring the not-so-beaten path often feels frustrating because of the mountainous terrain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This didn't really feel like a big problem until I hit a certain area of the map where fast travel points were sparse. The quests here also had me running back and forth, and without fast travel, I had to wrestle with slopes until I just gave up and relinquished control to the wayfinder.</p>

<p>This made me realize that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> and its seemingly "random" moments feel less magical and serendipitous.</p>



<p>For example, early on in my time with the game, I'd run into random people on the road who needed help. Some were threatened by bandits, others had their wagons break down. One guy was in debt, so I handed him some money.</p>

<p>None of these were quest markers or side quests, and they made the world feel more lived in. It reminded me a bit of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west-part-2" rel="nofollow">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> </em>in how it brought the world to life.</p>

<p>But then I did a main quest later in the game, where these same sorts of "random" events happened as a direct reaction to a story event. They were also dotted along the wayfinding path to my next destination.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the magic felt gone; despite being a big open world, I couldn't help but feel like the "intended" way to experience <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is on rails. And the joy of breaking out of that cage is constantly hampered by the map's own geometry.</p>



<h2>Beauty Within Imperfections</h2>

<p>It's a shame that traversing the map freely has so many roadblocks, because ironically, the hills and valleys have a naturally striking appeal. After climbing to the top of a viewpoint and scanning around, it's hard not to take a screenshot of what's in front of you.</p>

<p>Mountains of treetops give way to pagodas and temples, while majestic castles overlook a sea of lush greenery. When the seasons change, it makes the world feel alive. Fast traveling from fall's warm hues to a blank canvas of fresh snow never gets old.</p>



<p>Overall, Ubisoft has done a great job capturing the natural beauty of Japan in <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. But that beauty is also ironically responsible for making exploration more of a chore.</p>

<p>It's a continuation and exacerbation of a problem I've had with the current <em>Assassin's Creed</em> formula <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow">that started with <em>Origins</em></a>. The fastest way to get to your destination is usually by horse, which feels like an overall passive experience. But at least in previous games, it wasn't too hard to go off the beaten path and meander.</p>

<p>In <em>Shadows</em>, though, that passive experience feels more required than ever. It feels like the game might as well play itself sometimes.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has been an enormous success - like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-fourth-expansion-releases-really-really-soon">a 100m downloads enormous success</a> - so inevitably, there are now other, similar franchises that would like a piece of that action.
</p>
<p>
What other franchise like Pokémon are we talking about? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">No, not Palworld</a>. (Don't make things worse for yourselves, PocketPair.) We mean, Digimon, of course. 
</p>
<p>
So, here's Digimon Alysion - an upcoming free-to-play online card battler with a slightly odd name that publisher Bandai Namco likely hopes will get just a sniff of Pokémon's success.

<p>
Footage of the game shows battles against an opponent where each player has a selection of Digimon, represented by cards, on the field. This is intercut with CGI sequences showing characters gesticulating, Pokémon Trainer-like, at the cards. It's unclear if this is actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
From my limited knowledge of Digimon, which is basically watching the anime 15 years ago, I recognised several creatures featured in that original generation of Digimon monsters. Nostalgia!
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with the message: "Project Start!" suggesting it still may be some time before Digimon Alysion actually arrives. When it does, its set to pop up on both the iPhone App Store and Google Play for Android.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">Pokémon TCG Pocket announced an overhaul of its much-criticised trading feature</a> following fan backlash - though the changes won't take effect for several months.

<p>Cheating and hacking continue to be rampant across first-person online shooters. Delta Force is another that keeps being attacked, but if you are found guilty of cheating here, expect to face extreme consequences in the form of 10-year bans, and more. </p>



<p>There seems to be cheaters everywhere you look in gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite is known for handing out lifetime bans</a>—although the shooter is looking to give players reprieve—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-rules-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege has gone after cheaters</a>, and Call of Duty has infamously had problems with hackers over the years. </p>



<p>It’s a neverending problem, but one Delta Force is keeping on top of. Its latest cheat report indicates it’s stopped 20,000 cheaters in one week alone.</p>

<p>A March 20 post on the <a href="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1902666885906469042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Delta Force X page</a> makes for interesting reading. “Our G.T.I. Security team are working around the clock to kick cheaters out of the game,” it says. It also mentions five types of bans Delta Force is handing out, including the hefty fine of a “10-year ban.”</p>



<p>The total number of cheaters targeted by Delta Force this week is <strong>20,024</strong>. Below, you can see the exact figures for each type of ban.</p>



<ul>
<li>10-Year Bans—<strong>1,446</strong></li>



<li>DMA Bans—<strong>365</strong></li>



<li>Devices Blocked—<strong>694</strong></li>



<li>Cheat Attempts Stopped—<strong>13,475</strong></li>



<li>Players Forced Offline—<strong>4,044</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521&amp;content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force website</a> provides a more in-depth look at the bans and actions geared toward cheaters. The report doubles down that “We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone found to be in violation of our game rules,” and also provides the beginning and ends of banned usernames.</p>



<p>It’s great to see Delta Force taking the cheater issue so seriously. It’s a game on the up after the frosty reception to the Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players deemed to be “too difficult.”</a></p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 11.45am UK: </strong> Thronefall developer Grizzly Games has responded to the use of its name and logo by the company behind Flight Simulator 2025 - the Microsoft Flight Sim rip-off that uses AI art which Eurogamer spotted via a PlayStation Store listing earlier today.</p>
<p>"Thanks for contacting us and thank you for bringing awareness to this topic," Thronefall developer Paul Schnepf Games said in an email to Eurogamer. "We're not associated with Grizzly Games Ltd. and they're using both our name and logo illegally. 
</p>
<p>"Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community. Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power."</p>
<p>We'll update again if we hear from Sony - or the other Grizzly Games.</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11am UK:</strong> 
Flight Simulator 2025 is now available to Wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10014255">PlayStation Store</a> - but it's nothing to do with Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Trophies for the game caught the eye of Flight Sim fans overnight via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfkg5q/trophies_live_for_flight_simulator_ps5_that_hasnt/">reddit</a>, though it quickly became clear this wasn't a leak of the actual Flight Sim landing on Sony's console. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Flight Simulator 2025 features what looks like AI-generated art for its cover image, and has been made by a developer named Grizzy Games Limited.
</p>
<p>
A quick search online brings up the <a href="https://www.grizzly-games.com/#games">Grizzly-Games.com website, which features a long list of supposed mobile projects </a> that also feature clearly AI-generated artwork for their title covers. 
</p>
<p>
These mobile games - Idle Command: Supply Frontline, Merge Blocks Magic Numbers, Color Page ASMR: Drawing Art, etc - all have links to download the apps via the Google Play store, but all of these links are broken. It's unclear if these games ever existed.
</p>
<p>
The single game with actual gameplay visible is City Outlet: Store Empire, which looks to be a tycoon game based in a corner of a shopping mall. You can see a trailer of it below:
</p>

</a>
</p>

<p>
If the name Grizzly Games sounds familiar, then it's because this developer shares its name with the developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thronefall-kingdom-building-hack-and-slash-and-the-spirit-of-lumines">popular indie action title Thronefall</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the team behind City Outlet: Store Empire and Flight Simulator PS5 is also using the same Grizzly Games logo of the Thronefall team.
</p>
<p>
We've contacted both Grizzly Games for more. We've also contacted Sony, which looks set to imminently launch Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that a knock-off game has been discovered on the PlayStation Store. What <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-suika-game-rip-off-set-to-launch-on-playstation">looked like a Suika Game rip-off was set to launch on PlayStation previously</a>. Meanwhile, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-rubbish-god-of-war-rip-off-on-the-xbox-store">we discovered a rubbish God of War rip-off on the Xbox store</a>. And in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-knock-off-removed-from-nintendo-eshop-as-sony-stakes-copyright-claim">Sony launched a copyright claim against a rip-off of The Last of Us on the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>
<p>
For now, perhaps hold off a pre-order of Flight Simulator 2025. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">real Microsoft Flight Simulator seems likely to actually turn up on PS5 at some point</a>.
