                <p>Prime Big Deal Days ended on October 8, but folks looking to upgrade their PC setup can still check out a few great Logitech deals available at Amazon right now. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Mouse</a> is down to one of its best prices of the year, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G413 SE and G502 Hero Bundle</a> gets you an impressive mouse and keyboard for just $97.72 (was $160). Both of these are limited-time deals, though it's unclear when Amazon plans to end the price cuts.</p><div title="6535524 - Asus Keyboard and Mouse Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4721" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535524 - Asus Keyboard and Mouse Deal" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible\/dp\/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Gaming Mouse</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible\/dp\/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$95 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Besides a few good discounts in February and March, this is the best price we've seen for the Logitech G Pro X Superlight this year. Equipped with the Hero 25K Sensor for accurate movement tracking, five programmable buttons, and a weight of just 63 grams, it’s a good choice for fast-paced FPS games. Its PTFE feet also help it glide across most surfaces, and you shouldn't have to worry about any input lag thanks to Logitech's Lightspeed technology--which uses a USB receiver for rapid responses.</p><p>The wireless gaming mouse is compatible with both PC and Mac, though the deal is only available for the black model. Opt for the white model and you'll pay $100.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting\/dp\/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Logitech G413 SE Keyboard + Logitech G502 Hero Mouse Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting\/dp\/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$97.72 (was $160)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you prefer wired connections for their reliability, take a peek at this G413 SE and G502 Hero bundle. Both products are wired, and if you're playing an MMO or other game that could benefit from dozens of inputs, the G502 Hero Gaming Mouse and its 11 programmable buttons could be a good fit. It's also equipped with the Hero 25K Sensor like the G Pro X Superlight above, though its design is decidedly more aggressive and "gamer." As a bonus, its weight can be adjusted using five 3.6 gram weights.</p><p>The G413 SE Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a full keyboard with F Keys and a numpad, so it's a nice fit for both gaming and working. Its aluminum top case should make it durable enough to hold up nicely over the years (or during rage-inducing key smashings), and its tactile mechanical switches are built to be highly responsive. It also benefits from 6-key rollover, LED lighting, and PBT keycaps.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Alongside these two Logitech deals, a bunch of Asus products are also discounted at Amazon right now. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCZQTF74?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Wireless Mouse</a> for $70.49 (was $150) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Three-Layer-Hot-Swappable-PBT/dp/B0CLF3WYGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Azoth Wireless Mechanical 75% Keyboard</a> for $155 (was $275). The former is even lighter than the Logitech G Pro X Superlight at just 54 grams, while the latter is a 75% board with a unique OLED display that can show your system info, an audio visualizer, or simple animations. It's a stylish model equipped with swappable ROG NX mechanical switches, tons of RGB lights, and support for Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connections.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3CX3QMD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Keris II Ace Wireless Gaming Mouse</a> is on sale for $100 (was $180), and with a 107-hour battery life, micro switches rated for 100 million clicks, and the reliable ROG AimPoint Pro 42K Optical Sensor, it's worth a closer look if you don't mind upping your budget. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Falchion-Hall-Effect-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DG7H487F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Falchion Ace HFX 65% Keyboard</a> is discounted, too, which could be a better choice if you're working with a small desktop or need to save space for sweeping mouse movements.

<section><p>Game Pass was the best deal in gaming. Now it's a deal in gaming, for some people.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Microsoft recently announced that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is climbing from the sweaty price of $20 US per month <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">to an eye-watering $30</a>. The "real" gamers around the internet already have a joke for it: "Xbox 360 dollars per year."</p><p dir="ltr">But while the jokes write themselves, determining if Game Pass is still of value to me at this new price has taken far more energy. Yes, the company has also added new incentives and moved some features around, but do these additions create value, or just even more confusion? Let's break things down a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes access to all Microsoft-published games--as well as many other titles--on their respective release days. It also includes a subscription to EA Play, Ubisoft Classics, and will soon include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew. With Ubisoft Classics coming in at $80 per year, EA Play at $40 per year, and Fortnite Crew at $144 per year, the total value of these subscriptions is $264, which definitely helps sweeten spending $360 a year on Game Pass--if you actually use them.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's talk about the subscriptions that come with Ultimate and what they mean. First, there's Ubisoft Classics. If you look at the Ubisoft Classics website, the standard subscription tier costs $7.99 per month, but only offers PC play. Ubisoft Classics' Premium tier, however, features both PC and Xbox play for a total of $17.99 per month. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow ">claims that its version of Ubisoft Classics adds $7.99 per month</a> of value <em>per</em> platform, meaning those playing on both PC and Xbox receive the greatest benefit. With the Game Pass version of Ubisoft Classics, you get access to a rotating menu of games in their standard editions rather than the 100-plus games--often in their Premium editions--that are promised in Ubisoft Premium. You're getting access on PC and Xbox, yes, but to a smaller library of games, in Standard editions instead of Premium. Microsoft wants you to think of this as a $15.98 value each month, but with all these caveats, it's hard to take the quoted "$7.99 a month per platform" value seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">EA Play, meanwhile, is more straightforward. Through EA, the subscription costs $5.99 per month and offers 10-hour trials on new games and "unlimited access to a collection of top EA titles," and it seems as though that's what Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is offering as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in their standalone versions, both of these programs offer discounts on Ubisoft and EA games respectively; there's no word on whether those discounts would apply to Game Pass subscribers. We're guessing they won't, though, because as part of the price increase, Xbox also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-perks-discounts-ended/" rel="nofollow ">eliminated the game and DLC discounts</a> that previously were included as part of the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew is a bit more complex. If you stay subscribed to Fortnite Crew all year long, you gain access to all battle passes all year, and receive 1,000 V-Bucks per month (12,000 total in a year) and 12 sets of unique Fortnite Crew outfits. But while this might sound like a good deal, even if you play a lot of Fortnite, it still isn't worth the value. That's because not all the rewards you get for being a Crew member are created equal--Fortnite battle passes and Crew rewards are full of throwaway items you probably won't care about to fill out their offerings. These rewards mostly aren't the cool genre-bending collaborations like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">Scooby-Doo</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">Power Rangers</a>, they're generic, non-copyright-infringing characters and songs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176"></a><figcaption>A promotional image from Fortnite's Scooby-Doo-filled Fortnitemares event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'd have to love the Crew outfits, use the Jam Tracks, and play LEGO Fortnite modes--along with completing the Battle Passes--to really get your money's worth. The short version is that Fortnite Crew is $144 for about $100 worth of V-Bucks, some skins you probably won't use, some LEGO pieces you probably won't use, and Jam Tracks that you may or may not even care about.</p><p dir="ltr">Regular Fortnite players (myself included) will often buy a Crew Pass to complete a season's Battle Pass and earn the corresponding bonus V-Bucks. But as an ongoing subscription, you have to be <em>extremely</em> invested in Fortnite to justify Crew on its own merits.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, when speaking purely in terms of Microsoft-published games, Game Pass admittedly makes a pretty strong case for itself. This year alone has brought us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gears-of-war-reloaded-all-cog-tag-locations/2900-6885/" data-ref-id="2900-6885">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, and I'd be remiss not to mention that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a> are all just around the corner. This also doesn't include the various third-party games that come to Xbox Game Pass on Day One--games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. But again, the exact "value" here is subjective--you'd have to play a lot of those games for the math to actually add up.</p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, a study published by Circana shortly after the Game Pass price hike found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-of-us-gamers-buy-a-max-of-two-games-annually-analysts-say/1100-6535300/">most US game players purchase two or fewer new games a year</a>. Sure, there is a lot of nuance to this statistic, but at the same time, when the majority of gamers report they spend around $140 a year on new games, does the average player truly find value in spending $360 a year just to temporarily gain access to a handful of them?</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that we can't rely on Microsoft to release that many games next year or the year after. It might happen, but again, we're talking about <em>potential </em>value.</p><p dir="ltr">To get the greatest value out of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'd almost have to use it to the exclusion of other gaming services, and that's not how the majority of gamers are using the service. Personally, I tend to like Microsoft-published games; by the end of the year I'll have played five of the above Microsoft-published games, along with a bunch of other third-party Game Pass games. I also play Fortnite <em>a lot</em> and tend to play games on my Xbox rather than my PlayStation. I'm one of the rare cases that can <em>maybe</em> justify that "Xbox $360" price tag. But even then, I hesitate.</p><p dir="ltr">In earlier days, Game Pass felt like a steal: You only had to play one or two games to justify the cost. Everything else was just gravy. With this price increase, though, the math becomes far more complex--to the point that it feels like you're talking yourself into giving your wallet to a guy who says he'll definitely bring it back and not to worry. And if that doesn't get you, the changes and transient nature of the service will.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Pass <em>was</em> the best deal in console gaming. Now, it's <em>a</em> deal in console gaming--but only under very specific circumstances.</p>

<p>Football Manager 26’s Open Beta date, launching ahead of its November 4th release, has been revealed.</p>



<p>The upcoming football management simulator, published by SEGA, has been highly anticipated by fans. Releasing on November 4th, the sports series plans to up the game with more realistic features and graphics. Even more so, FIFA announced a partnership for the title today for the upcoming World Cup. Fortunately, even with the November date nearby, the Open Beta is going to be even sooner, according to an article from our sister site, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-is-lauching-football-gaming-zone-a-new-football-focused-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>.</p>

<p>In an exclusive from <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Football Gaming Zone</a>, it’s stated that behind-the-scenes access to an alpha form of Football Manager 26 is out in the open. While access is reportedly only for professional footballers, the site learned that the code distribution email includes the release date of the Open Beta: October 24th. The information does work with a tease from developer Sports Interactive, who <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1978853555210457306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hinted at news</a> next week. While nothing is official until it’s fully revealed, it does seemly highly likely it’s set for then.</p>



<p>Dropping the Open Beta two weeks prior to the game’s release is a bit ballsy. However, the team has shown a ton of confidence in the product. A move to Unity Engine, as opposed to an in-house engine, has provided a lot more opportunities for the game to shine. Whether or not it will live up to fans expectations is unknown, but we won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the latest Aftermath Hours, Luke and Gita are joined by Matt Leone, formerly of Polygon. This week, Leone launched <a href="https://www.designroom.site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Design Room</a>, a new site to house his oral histories of video games, starting off with <a href="https://www.designroom.site/shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>.</p><p>We also talk about the adorable city builder <a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Town to City</em></a>, because Luke and Gita simply cannot help themselves. Gita makes a brief tangent into the world of Digital Audio Players, much to Chris Person’s delight.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review and we’ll include it in our oral history of this podcast episode.</p><p><strong>Gita Jackson:</strong> I love this sort of <em>Rashomon</em> thing you get when you're asking multiple sources about a specific incident. We just talked about the last issue of<em> 52</em> on my podcast with Alex Jaffe, 52 Pickup, which is about this comic book that was, at the time, written by four of the top talents from DC. And we've spoken to Jeff Johns, Mark Wade and Greg Rucka. The only one we haven’t been able to talk to is Grant Morrison, which, who knows what the fuck they're doing. But we asked them all, what was the genesis of this? How did you get involved in this comic? And they all had a different, like, completely different answer.</p><p><strong>Matt Leone:</strong> Yeah, I think that's what makes it interesting. I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game. There's just how people remember it in most cases, because there's not always that much documentation of this stuff. Sometimes people want to put a spin on it to make themselves look good and have the story be more about them. And sometimes it's just that their memory is not that great, because you're talking about older things. So you may hear one version of a story and then take it back to somebody, and they may say “oh, I hadn't thought about that in a while.”&nbsp;</p><p>The best example I have there is, so I did a bunch of <em>Street Fighter 2</em> stuff. The origin story of <em>Street Fighter 2</em> is told quite differently by different people. Like, all the key people who worked on it kind of each should have their own version of that story, and they're not, like, dramatically different. And I feel like if you got them all in a room, they would probably defer to some of the other people's versions of it. But yeah, it's interesting, just like hearing each person tell it and like, again, it could be that they want it to be viewed a certain way, or it could be that they just don't remember it exactly the same way. It could also mean that, like, you know, it didn't actually happen the same way for every person, especially when you're talking about the older days with international departments. The communication was not always that good, so the people in the US office didn't always know what was going on in the Japanese office. And you look at old game magazines and all the errors you see in those and like, a lot of that is just because the US branches of these companies didn't actually know what was actually happening at the time. They were passing it on the best they could, but they didn't necessarily have what they needed to have.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I mean, even now, one of our contributors, Isaiah, writes a lot about anime, and they talk to animators that are in Japan. And even now, it's very, very difficult to get questions over to a Japanese artist, get them back in a timely manner, and then also get anything really useful at all from those answers, knowing you probably won't have a chance to ask follow ups. I see Luke nodding knowingly.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett:</strong> Interviewing Japanese developers is notorious for, like, you can get half an hour with them in person, but everything goes through a translator at both ends, and then the answer that comes back is so canned that you want to challenge it, but also you're running out of time. Then that challenge is to go back through the translators again, and it's a huge challenge for games media because there's time pressure. You know, it's an upcoming game, or it's a popular anime, and you sort of want to get your story published in the next day or week or whatever. Is that something you have to worry about, Matt or it's like, you've got not unlimited time? We're all gonna die at some point, but you've got a really long time frame for a lot of this stuff. Is that as big of a concern for you? Or you can just ride it out and just wait very patiently?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> It depends. I've done a lot of stuff with Japanese companies, and there's a different kind of politics behind it too. Like some companies only want one spokesperson to speak, and they don't want other people lower on the chain to kind of talk about things even years later. There was an interview I did once where someone was like, I could talk to you, but you can't quote me to my name. You have to say this stuff came from this other person, just because he was the one who was approved to speak for that game. And I wouldn't do that, but that's just, like, what they asked for. You get requests from Japanese companies to check over your transcripts, and that stuff is just commonplace over there.&nbsp;</p><p>I think time is something that maybe I don't have to worry about quite as much on these because I'm not necessarily getting those 30 minute windows as much because I'm doing stuff on older games where people usually have a little more time to talk. So most interviews will do longer than that and have a little more time to breathe. But there's a time element of it, and there's a cost element to it. If you're hiring interpreters, or, you know, I re-translate stuff a lot to make sure we're getting quotes right. All that costs money. The difference between doing a story where you interview 10 people who speak Japanese on a game and a story where you interview 10 people who speak English on a game [is], like, thousands of dollars’ difference.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Speaking of Japanese developers, at time of recording, we've only just learned that Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at the relatively young age of 58. He's obviously an incredibly prominent figure in Japanese game development, especially for people of a certain age who have played the games he's most famous for. You obviously approach your pieces from a journalism standpoint. You're telling a story. But at the same time, we're starting to lose some of these voices and some of these people who were instrumental in shaping video games as we know them today. Is approaching your pieces as a piece of journalism and approaching them as a piece of history… are they one and the same? Or do you only focus on the journalism, and the history is just inconsequential? Or is that something that may have changed because you've been doing this for a long time as well? We start losing access to some of these stories, and so getting them told and written down is actually not just important for my website's metrics for this month, but is an important record for anyone who wants to study and learn about video games in the years and decades to come.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> It's funny because like, the <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> story I just did… I covered that game back when I worked at 1Up and I'm now doing retrospectives on games that I was around for when they first came around. This came up the other day, too: I was talking to somebody, and they were like, you know, this is preservation. And it is, because I'm talking to a lot of people and getting different accounts, and we're putting them out there in a place that we can keep out for a long time. I don't go into it thinking we're gonna lose this stuff if I don't save it. I think there's a lot of push from people to do that, and that's great in terms of saving, whether it's ROMs or interviews or whatever else like this. The idea of saving everything is really valuable, and I think that is something I am very supportive of. But that's not really something that I am conscious that I'm doing. I'm typically going into these like, okay, what is an interesting story? You know, what stories would benefit from having different people talk about them and stuff like that. You can't really separate it. It is both, whether I intend it to be or not.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-previews-dungeons-dragons-2024-circle-magic-in-new-forgotten-realms-books.1328287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a new preview of their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Forgotten Realms book. This new supplement for the 2024 edition of the game is bringing back an older mechanic, circle magic, which will bring more utility and power to spellcasting groups.</p>



<p>In a D&amp;D Beyond <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2083-circle-magic-and-new-spells-gain-mastery-over-the" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast provided a small sneak peek into the new circle magic mechanic coming to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>. As the name implies, this magic is a ritual art that allows spellcasters to combine their strength, amplifying and even reshaping some rules of magic.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-circle-magic-thayan-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=Whn9UxNx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-circle-magic-thayan-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=Qjd2f11h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> veterans, this mechanic is similar to its debut in 3.5 edition. In that edition, the mechanic was used by the Red Wizards of Thay, the magic-supremacist casters who act on behalf of the lich, Szass Tamm.</p>

<p>The post then explains how this mechanic is expressed in-game. First, the spell must use a spell slot, and have a casting time of one action or 1 minute or longer. One of the casters in the circle, called the primary caster, chooses the targets for the spell, spends the spell slot and expends any material components, and maintains concentration if it is required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other casters in the magic circle are secondary casters. They must take the Magic action and be near the primary caster to contribute to the spell. They must do this every turn for the duration of the spell's casting time.</p>

<p>Once this is done, the primary caster can enhance the spell's effects. These effects include enhancing its distance, area of effect, eschewing material components, letting all casters share maintaining Concentration on the spell, and protecting allies from the spell's negative effects.</p>

<p>The post confirms that the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-emerge-on-new-dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-supplements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Forgotten Realms</a> books will include new spells that greatly benefit from circle magic.Two of the spells previewed include Doomtide, a debilitating sphere of darkness that deals psychic damage and imposes a penalty on saving throws. The second one, Spellfire Storm, hails radiant fire on enemies and disrupts spellcasting.</p>

<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Forgotten Realms books will be available in both physical and digital November 11, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What would <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> be like if your fights with people and creatures played out like matches in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>? That’s the thought experiment at the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-streamer-blurbs-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-voice-mod-1851443327">streamer Blurbs</a>‘ latest mod for the Rockstar open-world game. There’s lots of punching, lots of blood, and some downright nuts fatalities.</p> <p>Blurbs has transformed mod-making into a communal activity by having fans contribute ideas and constructing and testing them in real time as viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmhOVmdlUEJCc3RCVDZkLUhBTF9IMkI0MWhEZ3xBQ3Jtc0trVmQ1WjdyS3JDZjJ3VFBoVXh0Y2VUZ09OYWdKY2tBRUhzTS1aRVMzcUJOUGhHZFRPNWRjUXB5a0pHTFNDTDdBQWYzWTdSc2I2ekxIT3p1YmJEYkJKLVdrRFkxcG1wVUptVURnQmVuMjRrNUdSTVRDYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fblurbs">watch on Twitch</a>.&nbsp; Last time it was a <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> mod that shows you <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070">the dying memories</a> of all the NPCs you murder. Now, for <em>Red Dead Mortal Kombat</em>, he starts with a basic mechanic where any time you punch someone, the camera flips to a side-by-side view like a fighting game and builds from there.</p>

  <p>Blurbs even went ahead and added rudimentary animations, sound effects, and cheat codes that need to be entered for fatalities. In one, Arthur Morgan lets out a tuberculosis-filled cough that makes the opponent explode in a geyser of blood. In another, the loser is pushed out in front of a runaway train that obliterates them.</p>

 <p>But the mod doesn’t just allow Arthur to fight people. In the video above showing off the mod, Blurbs also has Arthur go head-to-head with an alligator, a deer, and a grizzly bear. That last one does not go well for him.</p> <p>He’s currently taking requests for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> mods.&nbsp;“My whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is a looter shooter that revolves around… loot. But what happens when you can’t get your hard-earned Legendary drop because it got trapped out of bounds or behind an invisible wall? Desperate Borderlands 4 players are running into that exact problem and are now pleading with developer Gearbox for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Borderlands 4 you’ll probably know the feeling. It’s the europhoria that comes from a Legendary drop among the confetti-like explosion of loot that erupts from a downed boss. This is something the Borderlands series has always done well, perhaps better, even, than any other looter shooter. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-more-developers-better-understood-why-gamers-love-making-decisions-about-loot-wed-have-good-competitors">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford recently said if more developers better understood why gamers love loot, then Borderlands would have “good competitors,”</a> most agreed with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if that Legendary flies off and lands out of bounds, the frustration is just as intense as the euphoria that proceeded it. Double the intensity if the Legendary spirals away after a particularly difficult boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This has been a problem with Borderlands 4 since launch, but it was exacerbated this week with the weekly endgame content reset, which rotated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/The_Oppressor_-_Legendary_Drops_and_Boss_Guide">The Oppressor</a> into this week’s Big Encore boss fight. The problem here is The Oppressor is a flying enemy (flying enemies in shooters are almost always more annoying to fight than any other), which means it darts about the sky, sometimes over areas the player can’t reach. And what happens when you land the killing shot as it’s in the air? The loot flies sometimes lands on a roof, behind an invisible wall just out of reach, or off the map entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are, understandably, infuriated. “Do not waste your Eridium on this week's Big Encore Boss Opressor unless you want to lose loot,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o96xcp/do_not_waste_your_eridium_on_this_weeks_big/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor PuzzleheadedDust8094</a>. “If you value your Eridium and dislike getting screwed out of your items because Gearbox can't seem to prevent your loot from flying outside of the arena or through walls, you absolutely should avoid fighting this boss UNTIL THEY FIX THIS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have lost so much loot to bosses dropping stuff in places you can't get to because it's a giant death pit or because of bogus invisible walls. This week’s Big Encore boss might just be the biggest offender yet. I've lost (and I wish I was joking) 7 OUT OF 10 Big Encores worth of loot. That's 700 hard earned Eridium down the drain.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/a-lot-to-process-opressor-1760734763948.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Oppressor is one of the most frustrating boss fights in Borderlands 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I swear to god if they don't fix The Oppressor loot issues (out of bounds or spread around the entire arena rather than where the boss is) and flying around for a full f***ing minute before you can even hit him, I may lose a bit of faith,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o95l0m/ive_called_bl4_a_1010_from_day_1_but/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said StretchDizzy7792</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Please QC your Big Encore picks. Two weeks in a row of bosses with issues (loot under floor on last weeks). It takes 15 minutes of farming the boss to realize if there's an issue most people will experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope to god they pushed back the patch to add a fix in for this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Big Encore… 6 kills. 3 Legendary’s out of bounds. 0 Legendary’s in the lost loot box,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o8wlci/big_encore_6_kills_3_legendarys_out_of_bounds_0/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said S0LWAY</a>. “Horse apples! Absolute horse apples!!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to Borderlands 4’s Lost Loot Machine, which is supposed to be a backup for this very problem by scooping up lost loot and saving it for collection later. But it doesn’t seem to be working properly — at least, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1nhu25h/lost_loot_machine_is_useless/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players believe it isn’t working properly</a> — because it tends to favor low quality loot over rare loot and thus fills up, leaving no room for those prize guns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Lost Loot Machine has to be broken,” said one disgruntled player. “There is no way it's working correctly right now. I've only seen one purple and one blue item in it. The rest has always been white and green.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's supposed to replace gear with higher quality loot once full but it's definitely not doing that,” said another. “I constantly leave behind blue gear and that thing should be littered with blues, but nope.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GearboxOfficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GearboxOfficial</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Borderlands</a> <br>Flies around sporadically with no inertia looking awful, gets stuck on map geometry, upon dying flies out of arena to drop all loot in inaccessible places. Arena is filled with invisible walls for no reason. Did this fight even go though QA? <a href="https://t.co/JFUwmWKqJr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JFUwmWKqJr</a></p>— Bunbun Jackalope 🐰 (@BunbunJackalope) <a href="https://twitter.com/BunbunJackalope/status/1979240476902310325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Borderlands 4 players are trying to help each other out by suggesting fixes for the problem, although there’s no consensus on what works and no guarantees, either. Some suggest saving and quitting as soon as the Legendary goes out of bounds, and then, upon loading back in, heading straight to the Lost Loot Machine. Maybe you’ll be lucky. Maybe not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s hotly anticipated patch — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-borderlands-4-players-brace-themselves-for-the-end-of-the-op-crit-knife-gearbox-developers-explain-why-nerfs-are-needed-even-in-mostly-single-player-games">the one set to nerf “unintended interactions” such as the crit knife</a>, was delayed to early next week. Some are hoping this ‘Day 30 Update’ will also sort out Borderlands 4’s lost Legendaries problem. In the meantime, there’s a new mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/173" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Borderlands 4 NexusMods page</a>, that some players are finding success with (this is only if you’re playing on PC, of course). It’s called Ground Loot Helpers and lets you teleport all the loot to your character. Now that’s a quality-of-life improvement I can get behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike an invisible wall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dataminer-unearths-evidence-to-suggest-a-much-maligned-borderlands-3-character-was-cut-and-replaced-late-in-development"><u>a Borderlands 4 dataminer unearthed evidence to suggest that one of the most hated characters from Borderlands 3 was cut and replaced relatively late in development</u></a>. 2K Games and Gearbox declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate"><u>IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Who's your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Wait, wait, let me guess: is it Totodile?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, I was correct, at least based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx65Ppq4EA6KKNkicT8VFQJctnWwdt0UUn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll we've conducted surrounding the launch of Z-A yesterday</a>. Our poll's been up for 22 hours and has over 11,000 votes from IGN readers, and it reveals that of the three Z-A starter Pokémon, over half of IGN's audience is picking Totodile over Tepig or Chikorita. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time this piece was written, water-type Totodile had 56% of the vote, with 24% choosing grass-type Chikorita, and only 20%, one-fifth of our readers, picking fire-type Tepig -- and we agree with the winner: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/Starter_Pokemon_Guide:_The_Best_Starter_to_Pick">Totodile is the best pick, stats-wise, with some caveats we go over in our Pokemon Legends: Z-A Best Starter Guide.</a> <em>Update: At 32K votes, Totodile remains locked at 56%, Chikorita at 25.3%, and Tepig at a tepid 18.7%).</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This might not be a shock to anyone, though, as Totodile has long been a fan-favorite. Just look at the bitey boy! Chikorita and Tepig have historically gone less-loved, and Tepig in particular is an outlier in this trio as both Totodile and Chikorita hail from Johto, while Tepig was a starter in Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, while I personally went with Chikorita (having picked Totodile in Generation 2 every single time and wanting a change-up), I gotta say, Tepig by far has the best final Mega Evolution of the three. All members of this trio get new Mega Evolutions in Z-A, and while I won't spoil them here, Meganium's was rather disappointing and Feraligatr's just looks weird. Emboar though? Looking awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't overthink it though. All three starters are perfectly viable for the entirety of Z-A's campaign, and it's very easy to catch all three Pokémon for your PokeDex once you hit the endgame, so you won't be missing out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can learn more about the starter Pokémon and their evolutions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=backstage_event&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblZWNkRVX2ZuaVNfeU5BTnFIOE15Q1NaVzNDZ3xBQ3Jtc0tuSjVhT1R4N3Bmbk81UXVYSWd5eElNcGJYd1c2R01KczNzeTlsUlU2c3pGYURvSU5xWWR3QlFadlMwNi1tbWV4aVJKOG1udG9HSkF6LVpuN3ViM3hzU2paQTByVTNyeXZxWFFJOGRnVGsxMGJaZGRxYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Fwikis%2Fpokemon-legends-z-a%2FStarter_Pokemon_Guide%3A_The_Best_Starter_to_Pick" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our Wiki guide</a> if you're still on the fence.

So, when the August Battlefield 6 beta revealed mechanics that leaned more into movement shooter territory than the series had ever experienced before, longtime fans – often not-so-lovingly referred to as "battledads" – were quick to ask for changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios obliged, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcing</a> that Battlefield 6 movement had been tweaked to “create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience,” later that same month. Changes included reduced horizontal speed and a hit to jump momentum that many had used to dance around others. Shooting while jumping or sliding was also nerfed, thus causing a stir amongst newer fans — often called zoomers — who typically favored movement shooters, such as Call of Duty.

On top of all that, we also covered the week's biggest news, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/wizarding-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-to-2026">Witchbrook being delayed to 2026</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/07/22/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cover-story">3D Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki's death</a>, posted a preview for Quantic Dream's new multiplayer game called <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/16/quantic-dream-is-making-spellcasters-chronicles-a-multiplayer-game-heres-what-we-think">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, and of course, posted all kinds of exclusives for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, another week has passed.

The second-generation Rotom Phone’s camera in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex"><em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em></a> was a significant improvement, but the device’s real standout feature was its ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">keep you from plummeting to your death</a> if you fell from a great height.</p><p>While neither of the early Rotom Phones were as visually interesting as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>’ Arc Phone, they both spoke to how the <em>Pokémon </em>universe’s consumer tech has become increasingly streamlined and robust. That trend continues in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>with a new Rotom Phone that feels like it was designed for urban exploration.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/801113/pokemon-legends-za-rotom-phone-pokedex-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzA4ODY=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126232/fallout-pip-boy-review">Fallout Pip-Boy review: a wearable fit for the wasteland</a></h2><div><p>It’s hard to say what, precisely, makes a design timeless. Some classic gadgets are simply beautiful, while others remain functional years after they come out. The list of truly timeless products in tech is small, but there’s one name that looms large: RobCo Industries’ Pip-Boy. Sure, it’s relatively simple, and some of its features only work if you’re stuck underground. But when a design hasn’t changed for 200 years, you know it’s doing something right.</p><p>For those who have been living under an irradiated rock, a Pip-Boy is a wrist-worn computer that — despite originally being meant for the pre-war world and, later, life inside of a Vault-Tec vault — has become an indispensable tool for survival out in the wasteland. It’s large and rugged, though not particularly heavy or uncomfortable, and is outfitted with plenty of satisfyingly chunky dials and buttons. From an aesthetic perspective, it’s surprisingly versatile, pairing with everything from a Vault-Tec jumpsuit to raider armor. You never really have to worry about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113500/wearables-smartwatches-smart-glasses-smart-rings-etiquette">when and where it’s okay to wear one</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126232/fallout-pip-boy-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzQ0MjA=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">3 Body Problem VR headset review: magical tech in need of more apps</a></h2><div><p>Arthur C. Clarke famously said that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and that’s never been more true than with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24102256/netflix-3-body-problem-review"><em>3 Body Problem</em></a> VR headset. It’s so far ahead of everything else on the market that it doesn’t seem possible. There’s really no doubt: this is the best way to experience virtual reality. Sadly, there’s far too little software to take advantage of all of that advanced tech; at launch, there’s only a single app available. And even though that one app is a game that could alter the fate of mankind forever, that doesn’t quite nudge the headset into “must buy” territory.</p><p>But let’s start with that hardware because it is indeed incredible. It’s a sleek metallic headset that’s so light you can barely feel it at all. It’s completely wireless, and unlike, say, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple Vision Pro</a>, it seems to work for just about everyone right out of the box. No fussing around with visual settings or specially-fitted seals. Just put it on and go. There are also no loading times, and the battery life appears to be infinite. How they managed to squeeze all of that inside such a tiny device is baffling. I’m eagerly awaiting the moment iFixit gets their hands on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU1ODI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719653/purah-pad-review-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Purah Pad review: a rugged tablet designed for the dangers of Hyrule</a></h2><div><p>It’s never easy to follow up a beloved device, especially when it’s one that managed to fuse ancient technology with a modern-day phablet. But the Purah Pad — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">a spiritual successor to the Sheikah Slate</a> — manages to add more utility to a device that already let you control physics. It still doesn’t have much in the way of entertainment options, but its new design and feature set are ideal for those traveling around Hyrule, particularly if you also have a wearable that gives you power over space and time.</p><p>In terms of hardware, the Purah Pad has a slightly more streamlined setup than its predecessor, with a seven-inch display flanked by physical buttons and other controls on the sides and a USB Type-C port at the bottom. It has a rather ornate design that fits right in among any other ancient tech you might have but also results in a gigantic bezel that can obscure the edges of the display. It’s form over function. I should also note that somehow, once again, this device has infinite battery life.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719653/purah-pad-review-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE2NTA=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Rotom Phone review: it’s a literal lifesaver</a></h2><div><p>As the <em>Pokémon</em> world <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23415407/pokemon-scarlet-violet-hands-on-preview-nintendo-switch">becomes a bigger, richer place</a> filled with an ever-growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/6/23443302/we-finally-have-a-name-for-the-coin-pokemon">new monsters</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21134790/pokemon-home-pokedex-transporter-move-3ds-games-switch-android-ios">pokédexes</a> trainers receive at the beginning of their journeys have similarly evolved with the release of each new <em>Pokémon </em>game.

While the jump from Generation VII’s Rotom Dex to the original Rotom Phone saw the device go through a drastic redesign to improve pocketability, the Generation IX Rotom Phone is more of an incremental hardware update meant to make the phone more useful for adventuring. Aside from a new second camera module and a thin built-in ring light around back, <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldean Rotom Phone looks more or less exactly like last generation’s model and comes in a familiar fiery red-orange but can also be customized with a variety of cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI0Nzk0" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22576224/tva-tempad-review-loki-season-1-review-marvel-timedoor">TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjY5MjI1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Zelda Sheikah Slate review: Link’s new phablet has magic, but no Netflix</a></h2><div><p>The Sheikah Slate is not your run-of-the-mill gadget.

              <p>On October 15, the devs behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> announced that the game’s most popular mode, Conquest, would be tweaked in a big way that would potentially lead to shorter matches. This change was nearly universally hated by the online <em>Battlefield</em> community, and now, just 48 hours later, EA is reversing course as it continues to promise tweaks and fixes for the recently released online FPS.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042"><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched last week to massive sales and high player numbers</a>, making it already one of the most successful entries in the long-running milsim series. But, as with any popular online video game these days, a lot of players online have spent nearly every day since launch offering feedback, complaining, or pointing out problems that need to be fixed. And EA is working on a lot of this, with fixes incoming for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/">overly bright maps</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-devs-are-trying-to-find-the-balance-between-zoomers-and-battledads-following-movement-nerfs-were-looking-at-adjustments-for-sure-to-find-a-good-in-between/">tweaks to movement</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-ghost-bullets-update-hotfix-network-bloom-2000635677">and more</a>. But among these many recent changes, one caught players on Reddit and social media off guard. For some reason, EA and Battlefield Studios lowered the ticket count for all levels when playing <em>BF6</em>‘s flagship mode, Conquest. And oh boy, were people mad about this change.</p>

 <p>For those not familiar with Conquest in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>BF6</em></a>, the mode is all about capturing various points on large maps and holding them. The more you hold, the slower your ticket count ticks down. And any time a player dies and respawns, a ticket is also removed from that team. The side that hits 0 first loses. Before October 15, every map in <em>BF6</em> featured 1000 tickets for both sides. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">But then that was tweaked</a>, with different, lower starting ticket values depending on which map you were playing. EA claimed this was because battles were going on too long and timing out, so the idea was that lower ticket counts would lead to more matches ending because a team hit 0 and not because the timer ran out.</p>

 <p>This tweak angered many online as it seemed like something nobody was asking for. Likewise, many players, myself included, have played for many days now and have never seen a match end due to the timer running out. Other players were also mad because for them, <em>Battlefield’s</em> Conquest mode has always been about long matches that go back and forth for upwards of 20 minutes. As many pointed out online in thousands of messages and posts, if you want shorter matches, there are plenty of modes in <em>BF6</em> that offer that experience. Lowering the ticket count ultimately felt like a solution for a problem that didn’t exist, and EA seemingly agrees because it’s already reversed course on the controversial change.</p>

 <p>On October 17, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944">the official <em>Battlefield</em> social media account on Twitter posted</a> that the devs had “heard your feedback” and the studio was reverting the change.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45 minute timed rounds.</p> <p>Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We’ve heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds,” posted the official account. “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm, this change may lead to longer match durations. We’ll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right.”</p>

 <p>It’s very odd to me that EA seems so concerned about long matches in Conquest, as that’s always been how the mode works, something other players pointed out in the comments below. I think the best way to solve this problem is to just add a “Fast Conquest” mode that has fewer tickets and is all about keeping matches short. Players who really prefer that version of Conquest can go enjoy it, and everyone else can grind away in 40-minute matches that go back and forth.</p> <p>In fact, I’d love to see EA do some official playlists that feature 2000-ticket matches, as sometimes I just want to spend an hour fighting in Operation Firestorm, you know? At least for now, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s most iconic mode is back to normal, and just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">some big XP changes that should make it easier to unlock new gear</a>.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers of the widely acclaimed Helldivers 2, are working on a brand new game and are looking for a new system designer to help with it. </p>



<p>According to a job listing on the company’s website, Arrowhead Studios is searching for a Senior System Designer for a new co-op Action game. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re looking for a talented Senior Systems Designer to join our growing design department and help shape the foundation of a brand-new, unannounced project,” </strong>the <a href="https://jobs.arrowheadgamestudios.com/jobs/6618789-senior-system-designer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">description reads</a>. <strong>“This is your chance to be part of an co-op action game from the start. You’ll be at the heart of building and tuning the core systems, progression loops, and combat feel like an Arrowhead Game.”</strong></p>



<p>Not much else is known about what this new action game will feature, but, based on what’s said later on, it will be for a completely new IP and built in Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>One thing that’s for sure, this new title isn’t going to be in partnership with Sony. In the spring, CEO Shams Jorjani said that Arrowhead’s next game will be “100% funded” by the studio.</p>



<p>A new IP coming from the studio shouldn’t be seen as a surprise by anyone. In September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-have-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jorjani said that the goal</a> is to make Helldivers 2 a “forever game” and that there were no plans to make another sequel. Instead, they want to expand the current game even further as the months and years pass.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see Arrowhead Game Studios build with this new game after the success of Helldivers 2?

While Black Desert Online is an MMORPG--rather than a single-player action RPG like Crimson Desert--both games share similar fast-paced battles and high fantasy worlds. Black Desert is one of the most popular MMORPGs on the market, offering a massive world to explore, frantic action-based combat, and gorgeous graphical fidelity. The base game is just $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/582660/Black_Desert/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but it's important to note Black Desert is designed around microtransactions and other in-app purchases (something that Crimson Desert will seemingly not be burdened with). Nevertheless, if you're sticking to the basic gameplay and character apparel, it should be a cheap way to stay busy until March.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X In Stock At Best Buy On Launch Day, Ships Immediately</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle-buying-guide/1100-6533331/">Pokemon Nintendo Switch 2 Console Bundle Restocked At Amazon On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-optimus-prime-soundwave-bumblebee-2-in-1-building-sets/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Bumblebee Gets First Solid Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-series-nintendo-switch-best-deals/1100-6535432/">Two Xenoblade Chronicles Games Get Rare Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man Booster Box Is Only $140 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-by-alan-lee-deluxe-book-box-set-amazon-walmart-deals/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Box Set Is Still On Sale For Only $108</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-preorder/1100-6529762/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Guide - Target Reveals Exclusive Launch Bonus</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's no denying that Battlefield 6 has had a massive launch, one week into the game being on shelves. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">amidst issues for PC players</a> and progression frustration, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">EA and Battlefield Studios have acted quickly to address</a>, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">officially sold over 7 million units in its first three days</a>, making it the biggest franchise launch ever, according to EA. On top of that, a new GSD data sales report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-launch-sales-bigger">The Game Business</a> reveals it's already won a point against its ongoing and rejuvenized battle with Call of Duty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/data-key-facts/games-sales-data/">Game Sales Data (GSD)</a> under Video Games Europe tracks software units sold for both retail and digital sales in regions across the EU, Africa, and Australia, and in its latest report for sales from October 5-12, it shows that Battlefield 6 was at the top of the charts for unit sales and revenue per GSD's tracking, with the latest entry in the long-running shooter achieving four times the launch sales of Battlefield V, and beating out the EU launch sales for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As The Game Business points out, last year's Call of Duty was the first one to be available day one to Xbox Game Pass subscribers, which does skew the launch numbers from that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">a year when Call of Duty was not available on a subscription service</a>. </p>



<p>That said, with Xbox seemingly committed to having Call of Duty as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">part of the list of premium releases Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers get</a>, especially since Xbox needs something to try and convince people Ultimate is worth $30 a month, Call of Duty available through Game Pass right away seems to be the new normal.</p>



<p>That's all to say that this is still a sign of just how successful of a launch Battlefield 6 is having, especially if it's already showing it can best the current standard of Call of Duty releases on the commercial charts. Of course, the launch of Black Ops 7 will be a greater test, since, realistically, there could be a chunk of Battlefield 6 players who've bought in just to get their fix until Black Ops 7 launches. Combined with the players who don't buy anything every year except for the new Call of Duty game, it's very possible that Battlefield 6 falls short of Call of Duty in terms of sales.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GSD charts, EA (the publisher) held on to the number one and two spots in the units sold and revenue charts, with Battlefield 6 in first and EA Sports FC 26 in second. Behind it was PlayStation's Ghost of Yotei, followed by Little Nightmares III, for both charts. </p>



<p>It's only in the fifth position that the units sold and revenue earned charts differ, with Red Dead Redemption 2 making the units sold charts fifth place, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 making the revenue charts. However, specifically with Super Mario Galaxy, it's worth noting that digital sales numbers for Nintendo games are not available, since Nintendo only shares physical numbers.</p>



<p>Here's the full top 10 list for GSD's units sold and revenue charts, per The Game Business.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-rotom-phone-review-better-camera-higher-jumps.1328173/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the <em>Pokémon </em>games’ Rotom Phones haven’t really changed all that much design-wise over the past few years, each generation has introduced new functionalities that made upgrading a no-brainer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/ <em>Shield</em>’s</a> Rotom Phone — the very first one — came with a bare-bones camera that made it easy to snap wide-angle (screen)shots out in the Galar region’s Wild Area. The second-generation Rotom Phone’s camera in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex"><em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em></a> was a significant improvement, but the device’s real standout feature was its ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">keep you from plummeting to your death</a> if you fell from a great height.</p><p>While neither of the early Rotom Phones were as visually interesting as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>’ Arc Phone, they both spoke to how the <em>Pokémon </em>universe’s consumer tech has become increasingly streamlined and robust. That trend continues in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>with a new Rotom Phone that feels like it was designed for urban exploration.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the third-gen Rotom Phone’s conservative design is a reminder of how <em>Pokémon</em>’s gadgets have lost some of their personality in the time since Pokédexes went from being physical objects to downloadable applications. But what the new phone lacks in aesthetic flair, it makes up for with improved hardware and a couple of fresh tricks — including one that makes leaping across rooftops a snap — that make it a must-have for anyone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">visiting present-day Lumiose City</a>.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODAxNzU4"><p><span>$<!-- -->0</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Hands-free usability is more robust</li><li>More functional camera array with zoom</li><li>Roto-Glide is a game-changer</li><li>Excellent call quality and battery life</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Physical design is getting a little long in the tooth</li><li>No accessories</li><li>Might not work outside of the Kalos region</li><li>No snazzy Pokédex art</li><li>Still can’t send your helper Rotom into battle</li></ul></div></div></div><p>As nice as it was to see <em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em>’s Rotom Phone come with a second lens, one of the most frustrating things about the device was that there was no way to zoom in on things from a distance while you were wandering around Paldea. That second lens seemed like it didn’t really <em>do </em>anything. You had to get physically close to wild pokémon and <em>then </em>open up the camera app in order to take eye-catching photos of them, which made it very easy to wind up getting attacked. That would have been a nonstarter in <em>Z-A</em>’s Lumiose, where unpartnered monsters will go out of their way to fight humans without hesitation.</p><p>But in addition to adding a handy new zoom feature by way of a third (very functional) lens, the new Rotom Phone’s back-facing camera array can also be used while you are moving — something that opens up a new world of possibilities for trainers who fancy themselves shutterbugs. It’s easy to post up in Lumiose’s Wild Zones, hide in the tall grass, and snap photos of wild pokémon without them being aware of your presence. And being able to move while you’re using the back cameras also makes it relatively simple to get the hell out of dodge in instances when something does catch sight of you and decides to launch an attack. (You do still have to remain still while you’re using the new Rotom Phone’s improved front-facing camera, though.)</p><p>While the new Rotom Phone’s front-facing camera can be used for video calls, when you try to take a selfie, the electric / ghost pokémon living within the device will automatically activate the back-facing cameras and turn the handheld around. Previously you had to hold the second-generation phone in your hand or with a selfie stick in order to capture pics of yourself with your favorite partner pokémon. But the new phone’s resident Rotom can be directed to move the device around while taking pictures from various angles and distances, which gives you the ability to strike a pose hands-free.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption>A pride of sleeping Pyroar.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>This is especially useful if you’ve downloaded the app to participate in Lumiose’s Z-A Royale and want to update your profile picture to something emotive. One major drawback, though, is that the new possessed phone requires you to stay still while you’re directing it to take pictures of you. Using the phone’s limited selection of built-in music, you can coax your pokémon to sleep or get it worked up before you snap a candid or dramatic photo. None of the third-gen Rotom Phone’s built-in filters are all that great, but it’s easy enough to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676287/nintendo-switch-2-mobile-app-screenshots-backup-upload">transfer them to another device</a> if you want to do some artistic post-processing of your own.</p><p>Along with the Z-A Royale hub, an updated, Lumiose-specific Pokédex is the new Rotom Phone’s most useful application. It does all the basic ’dex stuff like track how many pokémon you’ve seen and caught, where specific species live within the city, and how they move. It also features a separate listing of pokémon with Mega Evolved forms, but what’s great about this version of the Pokédex is that it gives every pokémon that you can catch its own unique entry, which was not the case on the last Rotom Phone for some reason.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new Pokédex does not display the same kind of fancy artwork for monsters that <em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em>’s did. But the new interface is cleaner, more intuitive to use, and does away with the last generation’s excess skeuomorphism. The default map application also provides you with helpful information about which pokémon appear in Lumiose’s Wild Zones, where Z-A Royale battle zones pop up, and details about locations like shopping centers and Pokémon Centers.</p><p>By far, the new Roto-Glide functionality is what sets this generation of Rotom Phone apart from others. The last phone featured a safe-landing mode that activated whenever it detected that you had suddenly fallen a considerable distance. Roto-Glide builds on that idea by giving you a brief boost up when you jump from a ledge, which enables you to do a kind of bounce through the air. It’s ideal for leaping across rooftops or completing some of Lumiose’s many scaffolding obstacle courses.</p><p>Like the Arc Phone and both of the other Rotom Phones, the new model has fantastic battery life and call reception — at least within Lumiose City. I haven’t been able to test the phone out beyond the city’s limits, and it’s not clear whether this model would work outside of the Kalos region. I also wasn’t able to figure out how to activate the phone’s wide-screen tablet mode, but other people seem to enjoy it. The thing runs like a dream, though.</p><p>My biggest issue with the third-gen Rotom Phone is that it does not seem as if there are all that many (if any) cool accessories to help you make it feel more personal. The device appears to come in a variety of colors, like red, blue, yellow, white, and a stony gray. But it would have been great to see this model get some of the nifty phone cases that can be purchased across Paldea.</p><p>Roto-Glide aside, the new Rotom Phone is a somewhat incremental upgrade if you’re coming from the last generation, but you will need one if you really want to get the most out of your time in Lumiose City. The beefed-up camera alone makes this a much more useful tool to have as you embark on your next <em>Pokémon </em>journey, and if there are some stylish accessories <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu">in the pipeline</a>, the device will be damn near perfect.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/801113/pokemon-legends-za-rotom-phone-pokedex-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Over the last couple of days I’ve seen some people using the Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1978596002836734372">as a cudgel</a> with which to knock down <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">the new ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. And admittedly, comparisons of games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on both certainly don’t look nearly as stark as the price difference between the two handhelds. However, I don’t see that as a loss for the new premium PC gaming handheld so much as a win for Nintendo’s latest console.</p> <p>I’ve been going back and replaying a fair bit of CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG on both machines and frequently find myself straining to feel a significant difference. I run through the streets of the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion’s Dog Town on the Xbox Ally X using AMD’s recommended settings and the in-game graphics on high while in the performance power mode. I get 40-50fps, the lighting looks decent, and the textures are just detailed and clean enough to not draw my eye, letting me stay immersed in the world and action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636661"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636661"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Ally X (left) and Switch 2 (right)</figcaption></figure> <p>Then I move over to Switch 2 thanks to the (occasionally finnicky) cloudsave syncing feature. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will run around 40fps in performance mode on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld, I don’t find the extra smoothness that worth it. Instead, I prefer the extra layer of clarity and visual vibrancy from the quality graphics mode. The action is still smooth. The world feels much the same. Pretty soon I can barely remember what looked different with the game running on the Xbox Ally X, let alone worry about going back to the more powerful hardware.</p>

 <p>I’ve spent more than a few minutes scrutinizing a handful of screenshots of the game running on both devices and man, it takes some effort to start spotting the differences.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000636659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636659">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636660" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636660"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636660">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Can you tell which is which? Stare long enough and you’ll start to see some bits of the second image that look a little less distinct, especially the farther you go into the background. The shadows and lighting aren’t as smoothly mixed in the second one either. After a few moments of intently searching it for imperfection, you might, like me, come away thinking it just looks a bit more&nbsp;<em>brittle</em> overall. The second image is indeed from the Switch 2 running the game in handheld mode. Does it look $550 worse? Not even close.</p>

 <p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> also seems to hold up pretty well in certain comparisons. There’s less detail. The framerate is worse. But it’s not necessarily <em>that</em> much less detail, or<em> that</em> much worse of a framerate.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">More comparisons of ROG Ally X vs Switch 2,for Star Wars Outlaws and Hogwarts legacy. Switch 2 again for the most part obliterating the ROG in image fidelity.<br>Switch 2 is also rumored to be getting an upgrade for its DLSS tech soon,so it’ll get even better<a href="https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb">https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb">https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/mnGEstkn5A">pic.twitter.com/mnGEstkn5A</a></p> <p>— 💫Sonicpulsar💫 (@sonicpulsar) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicpulsar/status/1978717824341119479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s weird to see Nintendo hardware holding its own rather than fighting for its life against more powerful alternatives. For now, at least, the Switch 2 feels more than just “good enough.”</p>

 <p>Now comparing the Switch 2 to the Xbox Ally X isn’t completely apples-to-apples. The Asus-made, Xbox-branded handheld has a slightly smaller screen, it runs Windows, and it plays tons more games that weren’t painstakingly optimized for it like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was for the Switch 2. The fact that a five-year-old game doesn’t look lightyears better on the one doesn’t completely disqualify it.</p>

 <p>The new Ally X also affords a prospective user all sorts of options and perks that the Switch 2 doesn’t, not least of all a pair of ergonomic grips and thumbsticks that actually feel great to hold and use right out of the box. There are also plenty of moments when it does look distinctly superior, in addition to having access to a vast library of PC games that might never come to Nintendo’s platform.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636663"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636663"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Xbox Ally X.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636662"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Switch 2 (handheld performance mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>But the match-up does suggest a promising future for the Switch 2. We’ll have to see how the the finished port of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> runs on it when it arrives early next year, but what I tested back in August felt similarly impressive. <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> might also shape up nicely. And given its success with<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I’m expecting the recently leaked port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 to be impressive as well.</p> <p>Look, this is only the first year of the Switch 2’s life. We could be in a situation come 2027 where most new blockbusters still have to skip Nintendo’s platform, or rely on ports that are so compromised they can’t be confidently recommended to anyone but the most desperate Switch 2 owner with nowhere else to play.</p> <p>That’s certainly how it felt with games like<em> The Witcher 3</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds</em> on the original Switch. Those were fascinating experiments that reminded you how limited and dated the Switch hardware ultimately still was, at least for anyone working with it who wasn’t Nintendo. I hope we get a few good years on the Switch 2 before it arrives at a similar fate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Long-Awaited Console Version is Coming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-console-version-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-long-awaited-console-version-is-coming.1328161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recap video recorded from Tokyo Game Fest, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov spoke about the imminent future of Escape from Tarkov. The game is set to hit a 1.0 release on November 15, dropping on Steam and welcoming an entirely new audience into the scene.</p>



<p>Within that summing-up video, Nikita dropped a juicy tidbit and confirmed that the console version of Escape from Tarkov <strong>is being worked on</strong>, along with new games set in the Tarkov universe <strong>and </strong>DLC for EFT’s post-launch window.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-finally-coming-to-console-but-when">Tarkov is Finally Coming to Console, But When?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to say when Escape from Tarkov will arrive on console platforms, and when it does, we can’t predict what it’ll look like. Many have long believed that Escape from Tarkov will take a ‘lite’ form for console users, with Battlestate Games stripping back some of the complexity, which is better handled using a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video, uploaded by Battlestate Games earlier today:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s only a snapshot reference, but at 02:10, Nikita says (while talking about what BSG is working on):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Also, the console version, by the way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s it—the truth of the matter from the horse’s mouth.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been going for almost ten years, and for the last <strong>eight </strong>of those, it has sat in a beta state, with Battlestate making many tweaks and issuing content drops every six months or so. It’s all coming to a head next month when Escape from Tarkov <strong>finally </strong>hits 1.0, becoming established as a ‘fully released’ game.</p>



<p>That immense update will usher in a new map, fresh factions, and even a linear story that will see players finally escape from Tarkov, securing one of <strong>four endings</strong>.</p>



<p>How do you feel about a possible release of Escape from Tarkov on consoles? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT68G1TP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Gamestation Go</a></strong> is a 7-inch handheld with over 200 games and a few unique control methods, including a paddle, trak-ball, and even a numeric keypad. Retro enthusiasts interested in the Gamestation Go may want to secure one soon. Preorders for the $180 portable are sold out on Atari's website, but you can still snag one from Amazon ahead of its October 31 launch.</p><p>The Atari Gamestation Go releases the same day as the the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-pac-man-edition-console-wireless-joystick-bandai-namco-game-preorders/1100-6533716/" data-ref-id="1100-6533716">Pac-Man Edition of the cartridge-based Atari 2600+</a>.

On the left side of the handheld, you'll find a D-pad, trak-ball, and integrated paddle. Below the four face buttons on the right side is a 12-button numeric keypad with 0-9 as well as the number sign and asterisk. It also has four shoulder buttons.</p><p>Atari 8-bit and 16-bit games made use of a variety of controllers, and the Gamestation Go looks to offer the most comprehensive experience yet in a handheld form factor. One interesting feature is called SmartGlow, which illuminates the controls for each game you boot up.</p><p>The built-in game library includes a wide range of arcade and console games from the Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, and Atari Arcade. Notable publisher partnerships include Bandai Namco (Pac-Man), Jaleco, and Piko Interactive. It also comes with the modernized "Recharged" versions of five classics, including Asteroids and Centipede. Another highlight is Balls of Steel, a pinball game with seven different tables. The full list of games can be found on Amazon's store page.</p><p>The Gamestation Go's built-in 7-inch display looks nice in promotional videos and images, but if you want the home console experience, you can connect the included HDMI cable to your TV or monitor to game on a big screen.</p><p>It's unclear exactly which controllers will work with the Gamestation Go, but the handheld has a pair of USB-C ports on the back for multiplayer. We know My Arcade is making an official controller and joystick, but we'd expect the Gamestation Go to support other controllers similar to the Game Station Pro home console.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4724" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535527 - My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro" data-collection="" title="6535527 - My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600\/dp\/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600\/dp\/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$80 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Atari Gamestation Pro is My Arcade's dedicated home console.

Alternatively, you can get a refurbished version in "excellent" condition from Amazon Renewed for $60.</p><p>The joysticks that are included aren't the best, but you can use many third-party controllers with the Gamestation Pro via a hardwired USB connection.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4726" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Amazon Hub] My Arcade Retro Handhelds" data-collection="" title="[Amazon Hub] My Arcade Retro Handhelds">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BT3XY8XG,B0BT4DTB96,B0BT4BXDN1,B0BT4DHGYJ,B0BT49G816,B0BT4FCXZQ,B0BT49M6Y1,B0BT413W7H,B0BT3YL9GR,B0BT49MXRT,B07TZLGVYD,B07GLF2JDK,B09TQ72L2C,B07YKCC247,B0BKH987LX,B08GF7KZV3,B0B78H5KCH,B0B83VZFWZ,B07SHKQLRN,B07SMQFGXB,B0DSCQG3PM,B0DSCQFN4C,B0DSCPTXGJ,B0DSCQYC6V,B0DSCQH4XJ,B0DSCPD9PR,B0DSCMZCK3,B0DSCN124T,B0FD61VL1C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BT3XY8XG,B0BT4DTB96,B0BT4BXDN1,B0BT4DHGYJ,B0BT49G816,B0BT4FCXZQ,B0BT49M6Y1,B0BT413W7H,B0BT3YL9GR,B0BT49MXRT,B07TZLGVYD,B07GLF2JDK,B09TQ72L2C,B07YKCC247,B0BKH987LX,B08GF7KZV3,B0B78H5KCH,B0B83VZFWZ,B07SHKQLRN,B07SMQFGXB,B0DSCQG3PM,B0DSCQFN4C,B0DSCPTXGJ,B0DSCQYC6V,B0DSCQH4XJ,B0DSCPD9PR,B0DSCMZCK3,B0DSCN124T,B0FD61VL1C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BT3XY8XG,B0BT4DTB96,B0BT4BXDN1,B0BT4DHGYJ,B0BT49G816,B0BT4FCXZQ,B0BT49M6Y1,B0BT413W7H,B0BT3YL9GR,B0BT49MXRT,B07TZLGVYD,B07GLF2JDK,B09TQ72L2C,B07YKCC247,B0BKH987LX,B08GF7KZV3,B0B78H5KCH,B0B83VZFWZ,B07SHKQLRN,B07SMQFGXB,B0DSCQG3PM,B0DSCQFN4C,B0DSCPTXGJ,B0DSCQYC6V,B0DSCQH4XJ,B0DSCPD9PR,B0DSCMZCK3,B0DSCN124T,B0FD61VL1C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">My Arcade Retro Handhelds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BT3XY8XG,B0BT4DTB96,B0BT4BXDN1,B0BT4DHGYJ,B0BT49G816,B0BT4FCXZQ,B0BT49M6Y1,B0BT413W7H,B0BT3YL9GR,B0BT49MXRT,B07TZLGVYD,B07GLF2JDK,B09TQ72L2C,B07YKCC247,B0BKH987LX,B08GF7KZV3,B0B78H5KCH,B0B83VZFWZ,B07SHKQLRN,B07SMQFGXB,B0DSCQG3PM,B0DSCQFN4C,B0DSCPTXGJ,B0DSCQYC6V,B0DSCQH4XJ,B0DSCPD9PR,B0DSCMZCK3,B0DSCN124T,B0FD61VL1C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BT3XY8XG,B0BT4DTB96,B0BT4BXDN1,B0BT4DHGYJ,B0BT49G816,B0BT4FCXZQ,B0BT49M6Y1,B0BT413W7H,B0BT3YL9GR,B0BT49MXRT,B07TZLGVYD,B07GLF2JDK,B09TQ72L2C,B07YKCC247,B0BKH987LX,B08GF7KZV3,B0B78H5KCH,B0B83VZFWZ,B07SHKQLRN,B07SMQFGXB,B0DSCQG3PM,B0DSCQFN4C,B0DSCPTXGJ,B0DSCQYC6V,B0DSCQH4XJ,B0DSCPD9PR,B0DSCMZCK3,B0DSCN124T,B0FD61VL1C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BT3XY8XG,B0BT4DTB96,B0BT4BXDN1,B0BT4DHGYJ,B0BT49G816,B0BT4FCXZQ,B0BT49M6Y1,B0BT413W7H,B0BT3YL9GR,B0BT49MXRT,B07TZLGVYD,B07GLF2JDK,B09TQ72L2C,B07YKCC247,B0BKH987LX,B08GF7KZV3,B0B78H5KCH,B0B83VZFWZ,B07SHKQLRN,B07SMQFGXB,B0DSCQG3PM,B0DSCQFN4C,B0DSCPTXGJ,B0DSCQYC6V,B0DSCQH4XJ,B0DSCPD9PR,B0DSCMZCK3,B0DSCN124T,B0FD61VL1C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Budget-friendly portables for $40 or less.</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>My Arcade is one of the most popular manufacturers of budget-friendly retro handhelds themed around arcade classics and early home console games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you dig strolling through empty, abandoned places, immersing yourself in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">backrooms vibes</a>, and enjoying all that’s weird and liminal, then do I have a game to recommend for you. <i>Dreamcore</i> came out in January of this year and it’s a perfectly good time if you love spooky vibes but aren’t too jazzed about screaming monsters and jumpscares.</p>  <p>Developed by Montralulz, <i>Dreamcore</i> is a directionless, HUD-free wandersim that takes you through strange, abandoned levels that almost feel endless. The game intentionally tries to make you feel lost with its lack of clear-cut instructions on what to do. Strange symbols written on walls, seemingly innocuous signs, odd music, and audio cues are the only thing you’re given to figure out where to go and what to do.</p>

 <p>The levels are so massive, in fact, that I’m thinking I might need to keep some graph paper nearby to map out these spaces. I’ve only completed one level thus far, “Dreampools” which is a labyrinth of tiled walls, random pools, and the uncanny use of diffused lighting that often makes those <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-graphics-mods-pc-rtx-4090-1851133618">wild <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> mods</a> or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/better-than-dead-trailer-controversial-bodycam-microprose-2000617981">odd bodycam-footage game</a> look disturbingly close to reality.</p>

Is it watching me?</p>

 <p>With so few things to actually do in these spaces other than walk around, the real challenge here is not losing your mind and staying focused on slowly unraveling where you should go, following what looks interesting in the hope that you’ll find something unique. It reminds me a bit of <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, but with far simpler environments and the narrative elements ripped out. You often have the sense you’re being watched, that maybe someone’s been here before, and that there’s something you <i>should</i> do, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636647">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There are currently three worlds to explore: the aforementioned “Dreampools,” an endless expanse of empty suburban homes and white picket fences in “Eternal Suburbia,” and “Playrooms,” described as “a sequence of spaces inspired by children’s play areas, recreated with an artificial and silent aesthetic.” More levels are on the way.</p> <p>So if the spooky season has you in the mood for exploring some creepy spaces without things screaming in your face, and you like a bit of the avant garde, <i>Dreamcore</i> might just be up your alley.</p>
