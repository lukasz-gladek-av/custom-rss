            <p>On the tenth anniversary of the release of free-to-play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, Bethesda has revealed the management sim game has been downloaded 230 million times across all platforms.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Bethesda reckons it's time to "celebrate a decade of adventure, excitement, and Vault-building fun with Fallout Shelter" by launching a new in-game event that offers "party favours" for everyone who logs in from 16th–21st June, including bonus lunchboxes, Nuka, and more.</p>
<p>"Tons of content has been added to the game since 2015. You've built Vaults, made lives (or chaos) for your dwellers, and embarked on thrilling quests, all while keeping the spirit of the wasteland alive and well," the developer <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6zT9anWe9yLVqi1F6gGPms/fallout-shelter-10th-anniversary">said</a>.</p>

<p>"Whether you've been with us all along or you're new to the party, now is a great time to head into the wasteland and start building. To celebrate this huge milestone, we’re offering up to 70 percent off lunchboxes in the in-game store from now through 17th June.</p>
<p>"So, dust off your Pip-Boy, tune in to the celebration, and keep those Vaults thriving. Here's to another 10 years of Fallout Shelter!"</p>
<p>As for those aforementioned party favours?</p>
<ul>
<li>16-17th June: Lunchbox x2, Pet Carrier x1, Nuka x10</li>
<li>18-19th June: Lunchbox x3, Mr. Handy x1, Nuka x15</li>
<li>20-21st June: Lunchbox x5, Pet Carrier x1, Nuka x20</li>
</ul>
<p>ICYMI, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout TV series has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>. That's despite the show's second season still being months away, debuting in December 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
There's still a few days to go until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is unleashed onto the world. Whether it's any good or not in its entirety, we probably won't know for a while yet given that online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of its ilk are always guaranteed to receive numerous patches to iron out some kinks. Our own Nic found a good bit to like about the game in his preview, ignoring the at the time rubbish guns, at the very least.
</p>

<p>
Whether those tweaks come or not, Remedy have guaranteed one thing: some big free updates with new things to do. Ain't that nice! In the 2025 roadmap, there were a couple of updates outlined for the remainder of the year. The first one, coming in the fall/ autumn, is called Codename "Outbreak". This one brings in a new jobsite, the Research Sector, alongside some new gameplay systems and enemies, and earnable rewards. There'll also be a new paid Classified Requisition, which comes with some armour, skins, and character voice packs - the playable stuff in the update will be completely free though.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The launch of FBC: Firebreak is just the beginning. Have a look at what the post-launch roadmap will look like.</p><p>All playable post launch content in the game is free.</p><p>FBC: Firebreak launches June 17. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBCFirebreak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FBCFirebreak</a> <a href="https://t.co/bZdliHaOil">pic.twitter.com/bZdliHaOil</a></p></div>— Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) <a href="https://twitter.com/remedygames/status/1932800170418139480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Then in the winter there's the Codename "Blackout" update. The jobsite for this one hasn't been named, but there'll be even more enemies and rewards, alongside some new equipment. You'll also be able to pick up another paid Classified Requisition.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's communications director shared in a <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">separate post</a> that there are plans for more updates in 2026 too, but the teams wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing, for free, in 2026 for FBC: Firebreak." Lots to come it sounds like then!
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak is due out next week, June 17th.

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> didn’t rhyme, but he did alliterate with his gaming this week. He enjoyed all of Dregde’s endings over the past few weeks, continued on with the excellent Disco Elysium, and dipped into the walking sim Death Stranding, which has him still rather befuddled.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alex-garlands-elden-ring-movie-should-feel-like-fantasy-warfare<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you could hire any director to make an Elden Ring movie, who would you pick? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might settle for fantasy heavyweights like Peter Jackson or Guillermo del Toro, or maybe you’d tap Miguel Sapochnik, the man who brought you many of Game of Thrones’ biggest battles, including Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards. If you’re looking for something a little more avant-garde, you could even pick Robert Eggers (Nosferatu), Yorgos Lanthimos (Poor Things), or Bong Joon Ho (Mickey 17) – filmmakers who, like Elden Ring developer FromSoftware, relish in the surreal, cryptic, and uncanny. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chances are, you wouldn’t pick Alex Garland. The British writer and director is known for the grounded, slow-burning science fiction dramas Ex Machina and Annihilation, as well as the inventively named war films Civil War and Warfare – none of which resemble FromSoftware’s work in any notable way. However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-action-elden-ring-movie-on-the-way-from-a24-and-director-alex-garland">Garland is precisely who film studio A24 has selected to adapt Hidetaka Miyazaki’s magnum opus</a> for the big screen. Considering Garland – who, in addition to directing, is also set to write the screenplay – isn’t one to take his multi-digit checks and phone it in, you have to wonder how he’ll try to make this work. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/elden-ring-dragon-1749649681736.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A24's Elden Ring could focus on the moment-to-moment journey of a single Tarnished, rather than the sprawling saga of the land's lore. | Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At a glance, Garland and Elden Ring do indeed seem like an odd match. Despite his considerable experience with sci-fi, Garland has yet to try his hand at hardcore fantasy – a tricky genre in its own right, and even trickier when dealing with video game adaptations. On top of this, his style doesn’t have a lot in common with FromSoftware’s. The narratives of Ex Machina and Annihilation are rooted in plot, dialogue, and characterization, while games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring tell their stories largely indirectly, through item descriptions and environmental design. (Civil War, set in tomorrow’s United States, was widely criticized for its lack of deep backstory). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just because Garland has never made a fantasy film, doesn’t mean he can’t. He’s reinvented himself and ventured out into new frontiers before – Civil War and Warfare are radically different from Ex Machina and Annihilation, which are themselves unlike the films he wrote before making his directorial debut – so who’s to say he won’t do so again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually, making an Elden Ring movie wouldn’t entirely constitute uncharted territory for Garland. Many people – including his own fans – don’t know this, but he’s actually an avid gamer. His experience playing the Resident Evil games apparently inspired his script for the 2002 horror 28 Days Later, and the 2000 film The Beach – based on one of his novels – features a game-inspired scene which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/opinion/601104/elden-ring-alex-garland-dredd-video-game-movies" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon’s Matt Patches described as “the closest thing we will ever get” to a Banjo-Kazooie movie</a> starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Warfare evokes surprisingly similar feelings to those experienced while playing Elden Ring: outnumbered, outmatched, overwhelmed, afraid for your life (or runes). </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While many filmmakers seemingly feign interest in the material they’re hired to adapt in order to placate said material’s existing fanbase (to this day I refuse to believe M. Night Shyamalan watched even a single episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender), Garland’s love for The Last of Us, BioShock, and – most importantly – Dark Souls seems to be sincere. He appears to have a decent grasp of what makes the series unique and special compared to other games. <a href="https://youtu.be/TMdasaWiYD8?t=855" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Gamespot</a> back in 2020, Garland said, “The Dark Souls games seem to have this kind of embedded poetry in them. You’ll have some weird bit of dialogue with some sort of broken soul sat outside some doorway and it feels like you’ve drifted into this existential dream.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sticking to this image of an “existential dream,” Garland could take his Elden Ring adaptation in the direction of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/13/annihilation-review">Annihilation</a>, which upon release was praised for its psychedelic visuals. This would work, but it is not the only path forward. Another less obvious but arguably more effective plan of action would be to adapt Elden Ring in the mold of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warfare-review-alex-garland-will-poulter-noah-centineo">Warfare</a>, Garland’s nail-biting thriller about Navy SEALs fighting in Iraq. I say this not because there is something fantastical about this film – on the contrary, it’s been marketed as the one of the most realistic war films ever made – but because watching it evokes surprisingly similar feelings to those you experience while playing Elden Ring: outnumbered, outmatched, overwhelmed, afraid for your life (or runes). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swap the war-torn Iraqi town of Ramadi for the ruins of Limgrave, alleyways of Leyndell, or badlands of Caelid, and what you’re left with is a film that adapts not the game’s encyclopedic, overarching backstory – the backstabbing saga of Marika, Godrick, Radagon, and the Demigods – but the minute, moment-to-moment experiences of the player’s Tarnished character wading through the Lands Between, so caught up in reaching the nearest Site of Grace in one piece that they have completely lost sight of their larger quest to become Elden Lord, whatever the hell that means. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Garland is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-director-eyeing-warfares-kit-connor-for-upcoming-adaptation">reportedly looking to cast one of the actors from Warfare</a> – Kit Connor – in the lead, it’s possible that his Elden Ring adaptation will end up adopting a similarly suspenseful tone, not to mention retread those themes of fear, despair, and senseless violence that Connor has already proven himself capable of conveying. Using Warfare as a blueprint for Elden Ring would not only take advantage of Garland’s strengths as a filmmaker who explores psychology through graphic, carefully choreographed action, but also follow the example set by the – fight me – only solid video game adaptation out there, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review">season one of HBO’s The Last of Us</a>, whose quality is in large part derived from the fact that its creators understood what made the original great as a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring, like FromSoftware’s other games, is not a power fantasy where heroes with supernatural abilities beat up giant monsters through flashy cutscenes and epic quick time events. It’s an anti-power fantasy that reduces players to nameless warriors who become well-acquainted with death and bang their head against the fog wall until they finally succeed. For Garland’s adaptation to reach the heights of his previous films, he’d do well to capture that bittersweet sentiment. And through his work on Warfare, we can catch a glimpse of what could be when Elden Ring finally arrives in cinemas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <p>Sony has seemingly loosened regional restrictions on a number of its PC games, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>As spotted by Wario64, the changelogs for all aforementioned games listed on SteamDB show that a number of sale restrictions were quietly lifted yesterday, 13th June.</p>

<p>Although Sony made no public comment concerning the furore about sales restrictions invoked in countries where PSN isn't available or shared any plans to address it, check SteamDB and you'll see that the games <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/833972/history/?changeid=29554938">have indeed trimmed down the number of countries where they're unavailable</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-removes-regional-restrictions-on-four-of-its-biggest-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a>). Just one region was added to the restricted sale list: Russian Federation.</p>

</span></p><p>This all started, of course, when Helldivers 2 was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash but not before several Sony-published games were caught up in the controversy. Most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">Stellar Blade found itself at the centre of the backlash</a> even though developer Shift Up had stated a PSN account was only optional and not a formal requirement.</p>
<p>On the subject of Sony, president Hideaki Nishino recently stated the company is open to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-will-continue-to-add-more-value-to-ps-plus-says-company-president-but-it-may-come-with-price-changes-too">adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future, as the company aims to "maximise profitability</a>".</p>
<p>The comments came as part of a discussion between Sony CEO Hermen Hulst and president Hideaki Nishino on PS Plus and the company's future. Discussing Sony's subscription service, Nishino stated: "We will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximise profitability."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-typhon-review-purge-infestation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The current season of&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;continues with the release of its third expansion set, <em>Kill Team</em> Typhon. Following a slightly different format to previous expansions, we're still treated to 2 brand new kill teams, along with the inclusion of a force of non-player operatives (NPOs) for you to battle solo. In this article, we'll take a look at both kill teams and what Typhon adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>A New Infestation</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Typhon, as with previous expansions, adds 2 brand new kill teams and some scenery that builds on that from the Hivestorm box. It also includes a set of player-versus-player missions, some non-player operative miniatures, and a mission pack for cooperative and solo play. The full box contents is:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Typhon Dossier</li>
	<li>10x Adeptus Mechanicus Battleclade miniatures</li>
	<li>5x Tyranid Raveners miniatures</li>
	<li>11x Tyranid Hormagaunts and Ripper Swarm NPO miniatures</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>15x Tyranid Infestation scenery pieces</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-2.jpg?itok=ndf8BF-j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-2.jpg?itok=veg-jWsh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Suffer Not The Xenos To Live</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Typhon moves back into the standard <em>Kill Team</em> expansion format with 2 new kill teams, some new scenery, and a mission pack that uses the scenery for you to battle in. It also includes a set of dedicated non-player operatives (NPOs) and a mission pack for cooperative or solo play. The Joint Ops: Typhon Mission Pack sees players battling these AI-controlled Tyranids.</p>

<p>2 types of Tyranid NPOs are included in Typhon, Hormagaunts and Ripper Swarms, but the rules for 6 Tyranid NPOs are included in the Joint Ops pack, should you wish to expand your Joint Ops games with miniatures from the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> range. The mission pack has 6 missions that can be played individually or as a branching campaign. The missions all use the Tyranid Infestation scenery included in Typhon, and scenery from <em>Kill Team</em> Hivestorm, which is also available separately as Kill Zone Volkus.</p>

<p>Technology under the Imperium's rule is manically controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Part of their remit is to seek out lost technology, to stop it from getting into the wrong hands, which includes Imperial forces, and sometimes other members of the Adeptus Mechanicus. These searches are led by the Technoarcheologists, and their lobotomized, mechanically augmented servitor warriors/slaves in forces known as Battleclades.</p>

<p>The Battleclade kill team is made up of 10 operators, the Technoarcheologist, armed with the powerful Eradication Pistol and Omniscaner ability, which lets you put a token on an enemy within 8 inches, or visible to the Technoarcheologist, and then any friendly attacks against that operative can reroll 1s. The Technoacheologist is supported by another junior Tech-Priest, a Servitor Underseer. The Battleclade has a special rule where, during an operative's activation, they can subtract one from their action points and immediately take a free action (except move) with another servitor after their action ends. The Underseer can do that with a nearby Servitor without ending their turn, and they can spend one of their action points to make a dash move with a nearby Servitor, to position then better for their activation, or to get them into cover (or out of if you need some bait).</p>

<p>The rest of the kill team is made up of 8 servitor operatives, 3 specialists, 2 heavy weapon servitors, and 3 combat servitors with a variety of armaments. You can take additional combat servitors, swapping out specialists and heavy weapons, but they're pretty good, so you're going to want to take them. One of the specialists is the Auto-Proxy Servitor, through whom the Underseer can channel their abilities, and has their own ability to make targeting enemies in cover easier.</p>

<p>The 2 heavy weapon armed servitors come with either a heavy bolter or a heavy arc rifle (you can take 1 of each), and you can take one combat servitor with a melta gun, up to 3 with Incendine Igniters, a short range torrent weapon, or a Phosphor Blaster, which always gets at least 1 crit, even if you don't roll one.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-4.jpg?itok=FYPNGEbw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-4.jpg?itok=sQh21mLV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Thoughts Of A Hive Mind</h2>

<p>The Raveners are a snake-like bioform that the Tyranid Hive Mind uses to burrow beneath the defenses of its targets in its unrelenting quest to devour all biomass. The Raveners are an elite kill team, comprising of 5 operatives, led by a Ravener Prime, who can gain an extra CP each turn if they roll higher than the turn number, and can really hamper your opponent's objective capturing abilities through tier Neuropredatory Crest, which reduces the APL stat for contesting objeives of all enemy operatives when determining control of a marker by 1. It also increases the AP for any nearby enemy operatives using the Pick Up Marker action, and stops them from rerolling attack and defence dice.</p>

<p>All of the Ravener's are fast, with 3 action points and a move of 7. They all also have the Burrow action, which removes them from the Killzone, or if out of the Killzone, allows them to be set up anywhere in your Tunnel, which you develop as the game progresses.</p>

<p>There are 4 types of Ravener specialists, and the basic Ravener Warrior. The Felltalon has the option for a poison attack, the Tremorscythe has a reaction to attack any operative moving near your tunnel network, the Venomspitter has a powerful Venom Bolt attack, and the Wrecker is tougher, and when attacking enemies, can roll off against them for additional damage. As you can only take 4 operatives, you will usually take 1 of each specialist over the basic Warrior, who, while deadly, doesn't have any special abilities other than getting the lethal 5+ against wounded enemy operatives.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-5.jpg?itok=uSFB9wZU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-5.jpg?itok=YCsbB4hU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Kill Team Typhon Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Typhon means that players finally get a dedicated Tyranid kill team outside of the original compendium, and the Raveners don't disappoint. They're fast and deadly, and their tunnel ability is incredibly thematic, and nerve-wracking for your opponent, who has no idea where they will come out. The Battlclade kill team is, as you would expect, devoid of emotion and entirely goal-oriented. It feels very much like a fantasy Undead kill team, in that you have to protect the Tech Priests, because while the Servitors are tough, they're really boosted by their overseers.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the NPOs and scenery makes Typhon a very exciting pack. Plug this into the <em>Kill Team</em> core rulebook and the&nbsp;Kill Zone Volkus set, and you've got a great experience for players, with player vs player, solo, and cooperative options (which can use either force in the set). The included kill teams are thematic and fun, and it all fits together to feel like more than a box with 2 new kill teams, but a solid gaming set.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest surprises of the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal was its proposed accessibility. For years, Nintendo has been known for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-that-without-change-accessibility-in-nintendo-games-will-remain-accidental">accidentally stumbling on accessibility solutions</a> while stubbornly refusing to engage with the broader subject. Yet, in the Switch 2, there appeared a more holistic approach to accessibility for which disabled players have been crying out. This was supported by a webpage dedicated to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FHardware%2FNintendo-Switch-2%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Accessibility-2785631.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoo_dOcl-VTBHzJx3R68LDlmAWIVWPctlJw4BlkSm8BRR32PNCNJ" rel="sponsored">the Switch 2’s hardware accessibility</a>. </p><p>However, specifics were thin and no further information emerged ahead of the Switch 2’s debut. Now, having spent the last week with the Switch 2, I’ve found that this limited information hid, aside from a few missteps, an impressive suite of system-level accessibility considerations and advances that somewhat offset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">the otherwise gradual update the Switch 2 represents</a>. But as we finally answer lingering accessibility questions over the Switch 2, there’s a nagging sense that this information should have been readily available ahead of launch.</p><div><p id="how-intuitive-is-the-setup-very-but-blind-players-may-need-assistance"><h2>How intuitive is the setup? Very, but blind players may need assistance</h2></p></div><p>I tend to find setup procedures dense and unapproachable thanks to cognitive disability. Yet I was pleasantly surprised at how breezy the Switch 2’s setup was. Aside from a few hiccups trying to decipher <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659074/nintendo-switch-online-game-sharing-loophole">Virtual Game Cards</a> (a feature I ended up opting out of), the whole process was intuitive and fast.</p><p>Accessibility features, however, are not available during setup. The console’s text-to-speech is not enabled by default, nor can you access text sizing and zoom options. This will represent a significant barrier to entry for some, and blind players may require sighted assistance during setup.</p><div><p id="are-switch-controllers-and-joy-cons-compatible-with-the-switch-2-yes-including-the-hori-flex"><h2>Are Switch controllers and Joy-Cons compatible with the Switch 2? Yes, including the Hori Flex</h2></p></div><p>The increased size of the Joy-Con 2 feels better this time around, as does the Joy-Con 2 grip. But the controller size and the grip’s unergonomic square shape still don’t take long to incite my hand pain. Fortunately, Switch controllers and Joy-Cons are usable on the Switch 2, and the ability to default to the original Pro Controller is welcome.</p><p>It’s encouraging that you can pair other controllers with the Switch 2 using peripherals like the Magic-S Pro 2. Though, given recent trends in third-party peripheral support, I’d be reluctant to suggest that support is here to stay. We’re already seeing some connectivity issues around third-party controllers, especially 8BitDo gamepads, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681153/8bitdo-controller-gamepad-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-firmware-update">8BitDo working on updates to get those working with the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>What <em>is </em>supported, however, is Nintendo’s licensed adaptive controller: <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/flex-controller-for-nintendo-switch/">the Hori Flex</a>. This works docked and in tabletop mode for games that don’t require mouse controls (some other features, like motion controls, may also cause issues). Keep in mind, you will need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to connect in tabletop mode.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="can-you-connect-a-usb-keyboard-yes"><h2><strong>Can you connect a USB keyboard? Yes</strong></h2></p></div><p>Not everyone finds onscreen keyboards intuitive or accessible. The good news is you can connect a USB keyboard through the console’s USB-C ports and use that instead, including during setup.</p><div><p id="what-is-the-text-to-speech-speed-its-inconsistent-but-us-english-is-120-130-words-per-minute-on-average"><h2><strong>What is the text-to-speech speed? It’s inconsistent, but US English is 120–130 words per minute on average</strong></h2></p></div><p>We have no official number on the speed at which the Switch 2’s text-to-speech reads, but we can estimate. Using the information the system reads when you enable text-to-speech, we’ve found that both voice options averaged around 120–130 words per minute in US English. For UK English, it was 130–140 words per minute. Different languages will see different rates. There was some inconsistency in repeated tests that could not be accounted for simply by considering when timers were started and stopped.</p><p>That’s not the only quirk in the system. Players should be aware there is a noticeable delay between landing on a menu option and the text-to-speech kicking in. Similarly, during testing, toggling text-to-speech off led to a notification with the word “disabled.” Reenabling the function without moving out of the accessibility menu, however, did not lead to anything suggesting text-to-speech was back on.</p><p>All told, however, it’s a good system, controlled by a discrete speed slider that ranges from 50 percent to 300 percent. The slowest rate for US English users reads at around 60–70 words per minute and the max speed, where many blind players operate, is in the region of 400–420 words per minute.</p><div><p id="what-screens-dont-support-text-to-speech-the-eshop"><h2><strong>What screens don’t support text-to-speech? The eShop</strong></h2></p></div><p>When enabling text-to-speech, you’re told the function may not be supported on all screens. As things stand, it looks like text-to-speech works across all system-level menus, but not on the Nintendo eShop. Given this is the first place most players visit after setup, that’s an oversight that needs rectifying <em>soon</em>. Most games also don’t support system-level text-to-speech, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><div><p id="can-you-adjust-the-switch-2s-audio-balance-no"><h2><strong>Can you adjust the Switch 2’s audio balance? No</strong></h2></p></div><p>Outside the ability to toggle mono audio — an important feature for hard-of-hearing players — greater audio customization is not available on the Switch 2 at a system level.</p><div><p id="does-gamechats-speech-to-text-transcribe-swearing-you-bet-it-fucking-does"><h2><strong>Does GameChat’s speech-to-text transcribe swearing? You bet it fucking does!</strong></h2></p></div><p>You may already know that GameChat’s speech-to-text will transcribe swear words. While this was reported widely as a bit of fun, it’s also an important accessibility feature that allows users — especially deaf players — to engage <em>fully </em>with in-game communication without having to decipher improper transcription and censored text.</p><p>It’s not perfect. You may find speech-to-text swaps in odd words at times, but this is an error rather than censorship of specific terms.</p><div><p id="can-you-remap-controls-at-a-system-level-yes"><h2><strong>Can you remap controls? At a system level, yes</strong></h2></p></div><p>Within the Switch 2’s settings, players can remap all inputs on connected controllers, and do so for each Joy-Con independently. You can also toggle the ability to access this menu at any time from the Switch 2’s quick menu, accessed by holding Home.</p><p>Unfortunately, current evidence suggests this option will not be present in Nintendo’s first-party games. <em>Mario Kart World </em>does not include any remapping options. Some might ask why this is a problem if system-level input rebinding exists, but in-game options for remapping are more instructive and convenient, and they limit rebindings to specific actions in-game rather than having to continuously rebind on a system level for every game. Being able to remap on the fly through the quick menu only mitigates this so much.</p><p>This is something Nintendo appears to understand, allowing remapping in the new GameCube games available to Switch Online subscribers. </p><div><p id="a-quiet-win-overall"><h2>A quiet win overall</h2></p></div><p>It all adds up to an impressive suite of accessibility features and customization that will, hopefully, grow in time. The strange part is that Nintendo is being so quiet about it. <em>The Verge </em>reached out multiple times for clarification on the Switch 2’s accessibility and for more information relating to the questions above, but Nintendo didn’t respond.</p><p>One might expect that points to an internal awareness that features aren’t as robust as they should be. Outside a few missteps, however, this is a significant accessibility win and one would think Nintendo would want it out there. More importantly, and this is a lesson to anyone releasing a device or game: players need clear accessibility information ahead of release to make informed buying decisions and secure any help that might be needed. </p><p>Nintendo’s shift to greater accessibility is welcome. But in restricting the flow of information before release, the win is tempered somewhat by Nintendo’s willingness to keep its players in the dark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's a question of gaming habits really, and how you approach doing things within them, that I'm sure holds up a mirror (mode) to our personalities in the 'real world' and all that, but I'm not a certified mind...person...so let's skip getting into anything deep.</p>

It therefore stands to reason that, when playing the likes of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> game, let's say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, since that's popular at the moment for some reason, I 100% <em>must</em> complete a cup to its fullest and shiniest gold-star level before racing the next one.</p>
<p>It is — or at least it feels as though it is — against any religion to skip forward though cups without first making sure I fully rinse the one I'm currently on. I just don't do it. Well, unless something is really frustrating me, then I <em>might</em>. Only might, mind.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs with most games I play. I can't leave a nook or cranny unexplored in open-world games (something that often puts me off them entirely) and I always feel the need to spend extra time milling about and trying to find everything before moving on - hence why Ubisoft-esque maps full of icons have the effect of making me need a 'wee lie down'.</p>
<p>So, I want to know, via the medium of a good old-fashioned poll, how many of you lot need to make sure you've done <em>everything</em> before moving on in Mario Kart's cups, and who is reckless? Who lives their lives like gaming anarchists, blasting through everything without a care in the world? You know. Having <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Let's get polling!</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is practically indestructible, at least according to YouTuber JerryRigEverything, who<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9jEYO2oaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> took it upon himself</a> to smash it 50 times with pliers and noticed it still worked. The YouTuber even removed the external plastic layer before attempting this test, which means in reality it's going to be even more resistant to hits of any kind.</p>
<p>Here's the quote from his video:</p>
<p><em>We did remove the plastic screen protector from earlier, and the only way to truly tell if the Nintendo Switch 2 screen is going to scatter into bits if we shatter it is if we shatter it! After 13 hits, the Joy-Cons pop off, and I'm starting to think there isn't any glass and the whole thing is shatterproof plastic. Another 14 very solid hits, and the Switch 2 is shockingly still alive.&nbsp; 15 more and still nothing! This is wild. If watching this doesn't give you confidence&nbsp; in the Switch 2's durability, nothing will. Only after 50 hits from my ridiculously large&nbsp; pliers do we see that indeed there is a thin layer of glass on the surface, and as you can see from the slow motion, Nintendo was right and it does indeed explode into little needle-like shards of glass without that laminate top layer. So I would definitely leave yours intact and in place. Most of the glass is still glued to the LCD, but there are still plenty of free shards of pulverized glass and dust that could embed themselves into little kids' fingers or eyeballs, so I'm glad that Nintendo has a top layer and nobody should take it off. Even though I did get a black screen of death, after a quick reset, Nintendo says it was just kidding about being game over and is ready to keep on playing. Basically invincible. I'm a big fan of the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is a 7.9 inch (20 cm) edge-lit LCD touchscreen with 1080p resolution (279 ppi), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC powered</a> variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and HDR support (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre</a> due to the display's low peak brightness).</p>
<p>The console is literally flying off the shelves, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Nintendo's previous record with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days on the market, roughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch had sold in the same timeframe.

<p>Per <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/summer-game-fest-2025">StreamCharts</a> (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-viewership-record-50-million-livestreams-1236431017/">Variety</a>), YouTube saw the most views on The Game Awards' YouTube channel (which is, of course, Keighley's other seasonal show), with views up 43 percent compared to 2025. According to StreamCharts' analysis, the average audience also increased by 30 percent, while peak viewership for SGF on Twitch was also up by 38 percent.</p>
<p>More than 1300 community co-streamers, "ranging from variety broadcasters to Japanese VTubers", shared the feed live.</p>
<p>"In total, the peak concurrent audience for SGF reached more than 3 million live simultaneous viewers across Twitch and YouTube, with significant year-over-year growth on both platforms in terms of average viewership, watch time, and co-streams," a press release stated.</p>
<p>It's now the second-biggest gaming/tech show of 2025, second only to Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> showcase. March's Nintendo Direct is third, while Xbox Games Showcase and June's State of Play come in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this month's PlayStation State of Play is similarly breaking records for Sony, as its <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/sony-playstations-state-play-record">June showcase smashed prior peak concurrent viewership records</a>, making it the most popular State of Play hosted to date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first Switch was such a hit that Nintendo decided not to mess with a good thing. Instead of releasing a successor that feels like a generational leap or a pivot in a new direction, it’s following up the hugely successful original with the Switch 2 — a welcome upgrade that largely sticks to the formula. It looks about the same, works about the same, and plays most of the same games. It’s the Switch, just better.</p><p>Nintendo’s bet is that it doesn’t have to wow people all over again, and so it made a sequel that’s only as good as it needs to be. After spending a week with the new console, I’ve realized that good enough is exactly what the Switch needed.</p><div><p id="a-refined-and-bigger-nintendo-switch"><h2>A refined (and bigger) Nintendo Switch</h2></p></div><p>Fundamentally, the concept of the Switch hasn’t changed. It’s still a tablet with a split controller stuck on either side, with a dock that connects to your television. </p><p>But the idea has been refined. The Switch 2 is much bigger, for one thing. It now has a 7.9-inch LCD panel, up from the original’s 6.2 inches, making it great for playing text-heavy games. It also means the entire device has become larger as a result, now weighing in at a comparatively hefty 1.18 pounds with the controllers attached. The larger size hasn’t bothered me, though your mileage may vary. My 12-year-old keeps stealing it to play <em>Pokémon</em> and hasn’t complained. But she’ll do anything for more screentime.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Improved hardware and display</li><li>Faster load times</li><li>New social features</li><li>It plays <em>Mario Kart</em></li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Disappointing battery life</li><li>Few first-party Switch 2 games at launch</li><li>No standout feature</li></ul></div></div></div><p>There are some other nice upgrades. Like the most recent OLED model of the original Switch, the Switch 2 has a kickstand that can prop the system up at a wide range of angles, and the updated version feels a little sturdier to me, making it great for playing in tabletop mode. It’s a huge improvement over the original Switch’s flimsy kickstand. The Switch 2 also adds a second USB-C port to the top of the console, which enables you to plug in a webcam for online play. It’s handy for attaching a charger or battery pack whichever way is most convenient, too.</p><p>What you get with that larger and heavier device is games that look and run better. The handheld’s screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which supports HDR10 and VRR up to 120Hz. It’s bright and crisp, and games look a lot smoother thanks to the higher refresh rate. But I do miss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">the more vibrant OLED display of the most recent iteration of the original Switch</a>, which featured deeper blacks and more contrast-y images. The new screen is a huge leap from the original, but it isn’t an all-around improvement if you’ve been using the OLED for a while.</p><p>The story is different when connected to your TV: the Switch 2 can finally output at 4K, with support for HDR10. You’ll need to play supported games to really take advantage of this, but it’s immediately noticeable how much crisper everything from text to gameplay is. HDR promises to make games more vibrant, though there doesn’t seem to be a standout game to show this off just yet.</p><p>Games are bigger this generation, too. Nintendo has increased the internal storage size to 256GB, but you’ll need to be diligent with how you use it; <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for example, takes up 59GB on its own. Expanding that storage means buying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">a new and relatively expensive microSD Express card</a>; your old microSD cards won’t work.</p><p>More annoying is that the battery life is worse than the original Switch. Nintendo estimates between two and six and a half hours of gameplay on a single charge, and I found my device dying around the lower end of that spectrum, especially when playing more intensive games like <em>Cyberpunk</em>. That’s not a great sign for the future if the Switch 2 continues to get more demanding games.</p><p>Some of this owes to the fact that this is simply a much more capable console. It’s built around a new Nvidia chip, custom designed for the Switch 2, and offering modern features like DLSS and ray tracing. There’s more RAM. The internal storage is faster. This is why the Switch 2 is able to run a game as demanding as <em>Cyberpunk</em>; it’s also why the Switch 2’s battery might die after a short two-hour stint.</p><p>The Switch 2 also has slightly redesigned Joy-Con controllers. They’re functionally mostly the same, but bigger and with a few small upgrades, like more subtle vibrations. They connect via magnets now, which are less fiddly than the previous rail design. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo says that the joysticks have been redesigned</a>, too, but they still aren’t using anti-drift Hall effect sensors. That means there’s a chance owners will once again be dealing with the dreaded Joy-Con drift that plagued the original Switch.</p><p>As similar as they are, the Joy-Con also introduces some of the truly new elements of the Switch 2.</p><p>To start, the right Joy-Con has an all-new button dedicated entirely to Nintendo’s GameChat social features. Chatting with friends while playing games isn’t a new concept, but Nintendo has finally made it not only a core but a relatively painless part of its user experience. You simply pull up the app, and you can see what friends are online and what they’re playing.</p><p>For the most part, it works as advertised. It’s easy to connect, voices come in clear through the Switch 2’s built-in mic, and video looks fine over the USB camera from Nintendo, which is sold separately. (The Switch 2 also supports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">an unclear number of third-party webcams</a>.) This is a huge upgrade over Nintendo’s old way of doing things, where you needed to download a separate Nintendo Switch Online app onto your phone and use that secondary device to chat.</p><p>The one flaw I’ve noticed with the new system is that screensharing — in which, for instance, four people can share their gameplay in <em>Mario Kart World</em> while they race against each other — looks choppy and ugly, to the point that I stopped using it.</p><p>The redesigned Joy-Con controllers also introduce a new control option. By turning the Joy-Con on its side and placing it down on a flat surface, you’re able to use it like a mouse. Unfortunately, the Switch 2 doesn’t come with a next-gen version of <em>Mario Paint</em> to show all the mouse clicking possibilities, but I spent some time with the Switch 2 update of <em>Civilization VII</em> to test it out. And while it took some getting used to, I found the Switch 2’s mouse controls worked surprisingly well. This may not be as true in a twitchy first-person shooter where every millimeter matters, but for turn-based strategy, the mouse was a big improvement over a standard controller layout. </p><p>In a nice touch, using the mouse is seamless; you don’t choose the option from a menu, you simply turn the Joy-Con on its side, place it down, and it begins mouse mode. This makes it easy to swap between control options on the fly. You also don’t need to use the mouse on a completely flat surface like a table or desk. I was able to play <em>Civ</em> just fine moving the Joy-Con around on my thigh.</p><p>However, it wasn’t particularly comfortable to play that way for extended periods. So it’s hard to see it as something I’ll use often.</p><p>So yes, the Switch 2 is exactly what it sounds like hardware-wise: it takes a winning concept and improves on it in subtle ways, and mostly doesn’t mess with what already worked. None of the changes are a huge leap, nor are any of the issues dealbreakers.</p><div><p id="a-launch-lineup-that-mixes-old-and-new"><h2>A launch lineup that mixes old and new</h2></p></div><p>Of course, the most important aspect of any system is its games. And the launch lineup for the Switch 2 is a combination of new titles that take advantage of the more powerful hardware and older games that have been updated and are noticeably better compared to the original Switch versions.</p><p>The best showcase for the console at launch is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. It expands upon its predecessor in ways that Nintendo says weren’t possible on the original Switch. The game takes place in a large, connected open world and doubles the number of racers from 12 to 24. It’s bigger, more ambitious, and more chaotic than any <em>Mario Kart</em> before it, and yet it also runs incredibly well on the Switch 2. It loads fast and the frame rate holds up, even when playing four-player split-screen, which introduces a frankly absurd number of explosions and crashes on your TV at any given moment.</p><div><p>Outside of that, though, the first-party lineup is surprisingly thin. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">An impressive-looking <em>Donkey Kong</em> game is coming</a>, but it doesn’t launch until July, so the only other Nintendo-made release is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, an extremely drab collection of minigames and quizzes designed to teach you about the new console. It’s a nice idea, but the $10 collection is missing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">the Nintendo charm that can even make folding cardboard into a fun experience</a>.</p></div><p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to play right now, though. There are just a few brand-new games. Many of the highlights of the Switch 2’s launch lineup are games that already exist on other platforms, but were likely too technically demanding for the original Switch. These include the likes of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and <em>Yakuza 0</em>, all of which look good, run smoothly, and load quickly. The new handheld is not as powerful as other current-generation consoles, let alone a high-end PC, but it’s still pretty remarkable being able to take Night City with you wherever you go, and have it feel good to play, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834520/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-hands-on">instead of just fine</a>.</p><p>Two of my favorite launch games take advantage of one of the Switch 2’s best features. Called GameShare, it lets you play select multiplayer games with anyone else nearby with a Switch 2 or original Switch, and it requires only one copy of the game. It’s not perfect — the second player is essentially streaming the game, and so the visual quality can dip at times — but it is a very fun way to enjoy co-op games that require a lot of coordination. I used it to play through a chunk of <em>Split Fiction</em> with my wife, and a few hours of <em>Survival Kids</em> with my, uh, kids, and it was a great alternative to couch co-op. We simply sat near each other, barking orders on what needed to be done next.</p><p>While the core launch lineup may be lacking, there are a lot of games that have been updated in a significant way to support the Switch 2. Some of these are paid upgrades; I dropped $10 to be able to use those mouse controls in <em>Civ</em>, and it’ll cost you the same to get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">a much smoother and faster-loading version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. These titles don’t look radically different, but they’re obviously sharper and running smoother; the faster loading times in <em>Zelda </em>may be worth the price of the upgrade alone.</p><p>Many of the free upgrades are just as impressive. I’ve been especially struck by games I’ve already played for hundreds of hours — <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> — both of which struggled mightily on the original Switch. But on the Switch 2 they look like and play like, well, modern games. </p><p>Actually, my favorite launch games might be the oldest of all. One of the benefits for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers on the Switch 2 is the addition of GameCube games. To start, there are only three titles, but they’re excellent ones: <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em> (with Link as a playable fighter!), and <em>F-Zero GX</em>. It’s not exactly impressive that a sci-fi racer from 2003 plays fast and smooth on a modern console, but it’s still a nice bonus. And the GameCube has plenty of heavy hitters that will surely round out the service in the coming months. (<em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>, please.)</p><div><p id="a-new-generation-that-feels-much-like-the-last"><h2>A new generation that feels much like the last</h2></p></div><p>In 2017, there was nothing like the Nintendo Switch. At a time when dedicated handheld gaming devices had seemingly given way to smartphones, and the PS4 and Xbox One era was in full swing, here came Nintendo with an underpowered tablet that doubled as a home console in a way that was simple and intuitive. It proved to be such a success that it revitalized the company into a growing entertainment powerhouse.</p><p>But eight years later, there’s a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2. The original spearheaded a resurgence in portable gaming thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Valve</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">Xbox</a>, and even upstarts like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Panic</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Analogue</a>. The Switch 2 not only has to compete with its predecessor, but also a maturing market of modern handhelds.</p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t feel like the kind of generational leap typically associated with a new platform. When you put all of its features together — the larger display, more powerful internals, better social and sharing features, and more flexible control options — you are left with a device that is markedly better than its predecessor, but is still a step behind the latest PC handhelds in terms of pure horsepower and available games.</p><p>But even with real competition this time around, Nintendo is still operating largely in its own sphere. And it turns out good enough is more than good enough when you also have the biggest <em>Mario Kart</em> to date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera-shocking-image-quality-but-its-cuteness-will-snare-you<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd9984a9e6f89/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Nintendo itself put out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">an official Switch 2 Camera</a> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the new console</a>, it's Hori's officially licensed — and we have to say <em>adorable</em> — Piranha Plant camera which attracted the most attention.</p>
<p>A little USB-C webcam fashioned after the enemies from the Super Mario series, it's certainly a lot more fun-looking that Nintendo's old-school radio mic-looking one. However, the cuteness comes with caveats when it comes to image quality.</p>
<p>Let's fetch our gardening gloves and take a look, shall we?</p>
<h2>What's in the box?</h2>

<p>In the box you get the camera itself (with clip-on leaves to attach to the stem), the base 'pot' which the camera connects to via USB-C, a 1.5m USB-C cable, and a little right-angled headphone jack adaptor (to use, presumably, if you're plugging in wired headphones but the leaves are in the way).</p>
<p>You also get a large leaflet full of warnings in various languages with a QR code pointing to <a href="https://hori.co.uk/content/PRODUCT%20MANUALS/NSX-001E_EN_Online_Manual.pdf">an instruction manual</a> containing the same warnings alongside the necessary how-to-use info.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, the resolution is 640 × 480 pixels, so instantly you shouldn't be expecting iPhone-level quality here. Capture is 30 frames-per-second and it has a viewing angle of 85°. To compare, Nintendo's offering offers 1080p with a viewing angle of around 110°.</p>

<p>As with Nintendo's standard camera, the Piranha Plant is surprisingly petite — even smaller than Nintendo's. The plant detaches from the pot, too, immediately making it an attractive option if you play in handheld mode a lot and plan on engaging in regular GameChat sessions with friends and family.</p>
<h2>First impressions</h2>
<p>I've never been a <em>massive</em> fan of Piranha Plants, with the notable exception of the amiibo, which ranks in my top three, probably. There's something about the detailing on the head, with the glistening tongue and the teeth, that I just find ace. And this camera has a similar effect! It's incredibly cute.</p>
<p>There's a specific place at the bottom of the stem for the leaves to clip on (I had them in the wrong place for a while). The plant's big lips close around the camera itself, which covers the lens for privacy - a neat touch compared to Nintendo's twisty shutter and 'on' light. The bendy stem/cable even lets you pose the plant, adding to the personality, and while it's not useful for anything in particular (other than taking pics of your camera - oh the irony), you're able to open its mouth halfway, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>The camera itself plugs into the top of the Switch simple enough. It's just light enough (30g) for the port to grip it solidly enough, though I wouldn't go shaking it too hard. But that goes for your shiny new Switch 2, as well.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c65e89c6c8f24/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot capture is disabled when the camera's on, so getting shots is a challenge. On the plus side, the 480p resolution makes my scraggly beard look fuller - whack that in the 'Pros'... — <em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>I tested handheld mode first. Once the camera is plugged into the top and you're in a GameChat group, simply share your camera in the settings and you're off (or you can 'Test USB-C Camera' in the system settings beforehand).</p>
<p>You can manually zoom in and choose whether you want your background visible, although anybody who's fiddled around during a Zoom call or Google Meet knows the patchiness caused by suboptimal lighting and other environmental factors on these filters. You can also chose to have just your face framed in a circle.</p>
<p>As the modest specs should make obvious, it's immediately apparent that the video quality here will be surpassed by practically any other camera-quipped device in your house. This device is <em>extremely</em> limited in terms of video capture ability.</p>
<p>However, for what it's designed to do — ie. work in conjunction with GameChat to inject your hilarious face into Nintendo games so that your pals can see (as well as hear) your moans, groans, and celebratory yelps while dealing and receiving green-shell punishment — it functions just fine.</p>

<p>As well as being a camera stand, the green plant pot doubles as a clip to attach to your TV — handy if you park your dock behind the telly. Clipping it to my thin-screened LG OLED, it felt a little precarious, but provided you bend the plant stem to balance everything, it stays put well enough. Don't go shaking your TV...but again, why would you <em>want</em> to violently shake your expensive electronics? Why do you keep doing that? <em>Just leave them be!</em></p>
<p>Ahem. As with everything else with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the Switch 2 hardware</a>, the camera just works. The face-tracking follows you around the room well enough, although it definitely gets a little, erm, let's say 'impressionist' if you're feeling generous ('AI-style, feature-melting nightmare fuel' if not) when you move backwards out of its face-sensing range. Around three metres back it started getting choppy for me, and the camera failed to pick my face up after I moved three-and-a-half/four metres away in a decently-lit living room during the morning. It's not a high-tech gadget.</p>
<p>BUT! I'd argue that getting upset about the image quality here is missing the point somewhat. When you look at Nintendo's own offering, it's a sturdy little thing but it's only delivering 1080p and, crucially, if you're sitting across the room, the resolution of your face once it's been cropped out by the software will be an order of magnitude below HD.</p>
<p>Also, any video conferencing tool that automatically removes the background is patchy. With the official Nintendo one, there's all sorts of artefacting and flickering going on as the console struggles to filter out the non-human elements in suboptimal living room lighting conditions. The lower resolution of Hori's cam doesn't help, but it's not a massive step down from the alternative, either.</p>

<p>Simply put, whether you go with Nintendo or Hori, you aren't getting premium-level, full-resolution, Face Time-quality video with either option. However, it works well enough to get the job done (which at launch is essentially injecting a live profile pic into a box in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">we all had a great time GameChatting with that</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally, the more pixels, the better, but the Piranha Plant camera will be sufficient for the vast majority of face-tracking use cases. It looks like the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree TV</a> might demand more with its CameraPlay, and the resulting images will look commensurately worse with this 480p cam. But even with its lowest-of-low-tech qualities, this camera just makes me smile every time I see it. It's a fun little thing.</p>
<p>Compared to Nintendo's camera, it's a straight-up trade: resolution for cuteness. If you happen to have a compatible USB-C camera already, it's hard to recommend either, especially if you don't plan on making GameChat a regular thing. But given that this is cheaper than Nintendo's camera (outside the US at least - this is £33.99 / €39,99 / $59.99), and that the other one, while offering better resolution, is hardly a precision eyepiece, it's all much of a muchness to me.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're wondering, it absolutely works just as a standard PC webcam. So if your laptop camera's borked and you want to give your video calls that blurry, late-'90s vibe, a Piranha Plant on your desk is an option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're buying Piranha Plant Camera — or any of the Switch 2 cameras — expecting a crystal-clear, super-sharp image, you're going to be disappointed. These are rough-and-ready webcams meant to deliver knockabout, lo-fi fun in the vein of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/game_boy_camera">Game Boy Camera</a> or the 3DS' in-built lens. Approached from that angle, Hori delivers the functionality you want in an exceptionally cute package.</p>
<p>If you're planning on streaming or you absolutely need the best possible picture quality, this simply won't meet your needs. Otherwise, only grade-A grouches won't grin when they walk into the living room and see this clipped to the top of the telly.</p>

<p>Expectedly, it's been another big one at Nintendo Life this week. We got the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">official sale numbers</a> on the console from Nintendo, ran down a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/11-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">games with 'secret' Switch 2 performance updates</a> you should check out, <em>and</em>, as if we weren't all full of news already, Nintendo lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">new Splatoon spin-off</a> coming to Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm using my crisp new system to dive into games at the cutting-edge of modern design... like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. Yes, I'm Switch 2-ing the GameCube catalogue in my downtime, but can you blame me? All those Knockout Tours take their toll on a man.</p>
<p>I'm also still fighting the urge to buy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>. I don't <em>need</em> anything else to play right now, but gosh, it sure does look good! Keep your wallet safe out there, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very much invested in Cyberpunk 2077 at the moment; it’s a delight playing this game on the go, and I just love cruising around Night City. I never would have imagined such a graphically intensive experience with a huge open world would work so well in handheld mode, but there you go.</p>
<p>I’m also playing quite a bit of The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. With the new wireless GameCube controller at hand, playing these games is like taking a time machine back to my early teenage years. Just pure bliss.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>OK, so, I haven't actually had much time to play Mario Kart World as much as I'd like to thus far, having only just managed to blast through all the cups in 100cc. So, this weekend we've got a big karting event scheduled, as I get busy smashing all of the content in free roam whilst my sons occasionally drop in to try (and fail) to best me in a race. Pair of losers.</p>
<p>Aside from this, I'm hopefully also gonna be getting into some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. I haven't played this one yet, and am hearing good things about the Switch 2 port (I don't mind 30fps in this sort of caper) so my wife and I are hopefully gonna be sitting down to some good old couch co-op. Have a nice weekend!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>The Switch 2 has more in common with the Wii U release than Switch itself. In the first couple of months on Switch I only had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a> to mess with, while on the Wii U there were plenty of third party releases that ended up being my introduction to franchises like <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong>. So here I am with a Switch 2, a Nintendo first-party killer app named Mario Kart World, while I am also playing catch-up with Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>.</p>
<p>But this week I also took a glimpse into the near future thanks to the ongoing STEAM Next Fest, confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will most certainly end up on my GOTY 2025 list, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> is the current-gen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> game of your dreams, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323490/Truxton_Extreme/">Truxton Extreme</a> lives up to its surname, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> will certainly see a spot on my schedule next weekend.</p>
<p>This is certainly shaping up to be one hot Summer of gaming!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>So, you've probably noticed I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart World. That's still the case — so many collectibles — but I have started a second Switch 2 game finally; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. Chapter 3 has had me howling with laughter (It's. T.V. TIME.) and I didn't realise how much I've missed Kris, Susie, and Ralsei.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm actually reviewing another game, a Switch 1 one, but you'll hear about that soon enough. Enjoy the weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Ant Dickens, Founder</h2>
<p>In the run up to Switch 2 I was most excited about Mario Kart World, but actually it’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> that has held my attention so far, it’s simply a far better experience than on Switch. Therefore this weekend I’ll be freeing at least one Divine Beast as my little boy watches on, this his second Hyrule adventure after we played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> earlier this year. Mario Kart World will just have to wait!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/streum-on-studio-has-split-from-focus-entertainment-and-will-unveil-a-new-game-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Paris-based developer Streum On Studio has <a href="https://x.com/StreumOnStudio/status/1933543316076830784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split</a> from fellow French publisher Focus Entertainment, becoming independent once again.</p>
<p>Streum On Studio was founded in 2007 by a few developers who had worked together on a Half-Life mod called Syndicate Black Ops. Their first game, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy, launched on July 29, 2011 on PC. It's a first-person action roleplaying game powered by the Source engine and set in a dystopian cyberpunk world based on a private tabletop RPG. In the game, the titular E.Y.E is an armed branch of the Secreta Secretorum that attempts a coup against the all-powerful Federation, a coalition of worlds and planets that rules with an iron fist.</p>
<p>E.Y.E itself is plagued by internal conflict between the Jian and Culter factions, the latter of which is the one the player character belongs to. Their loyalties are torn between their superior, Commander Rimanah, and the Secreta's chief separatist with unstoppable ambition, and the 'Mentor', your friend and instructor. The 'Mentor' tries to unite the two rival factions at all costs. Players are thus thrust into the middle of a fratricidal war fraught with political conspiracies and quests for power, involving different groups and megacorporations.</p>
<p>Following this first release, Streum On Studio turned to Warhammer 40,000 with the first-person shooter&nbsp;<span>games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/space-hulk-deathwing-review-lost-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Hulk: Deathwing</a>, released in 2016, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/necromunda-hired-gun-buggy-trip-underhive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necromunda: Hired Gun</a>, which debuted in 2021. Following this latest game launch,</span>&nbsp;Focus Entertainment acquired the studio, but it only lasted four years. Now, the developer has bought back its shares to return to independence.</p>
<p><iframe title="STREUMON - UNANNOUNCED TITLE TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTj1cb8_59U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The development team has already teased their next project with a brief trailer we've embedded above. Streum On Studio plans to debut the game's world premiere at some point this Summer; with Summer Game Fest already gone, it appears likely that the announcement will take place at Gamescom, the biggest European gaming event. This year, it's set to take place at the usual venue (Cologne's Koelnmesse) between August 19 and 24.</p>

<p>It's now been just over a week since the Switch 2 landed and Nintendo is already wanting to know how users are finding the experience in a new survey.</p>
<p>If you happen to be located in places like Australia, New Zealand, the UK or Europe, you might have already found this email in your inbox. In it, you can expect to answer the usual details like your age, the number of people in your household, some general gaming questions, and then more specific Nintendo and Switch 2-related questions.</p>
<p>Some of the questions about the Switch 2 include if you've purchased one, if you plan to make the new console your main gaming device and how you got the system. There are even some sections requiring written replies – like why you decided to purchase a Nintendo Switch 2, what you've enjoyed about it so far, and anything about the new system you're <em>not</em> really enjoying.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f241e228e1196/nintendo-switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Nintendo, places for this survey are "limited" – so if you would like to participate, be sure to respond to your survey email "quickly" so you can <em>directly</em> share with Nintendo how your time has been with the Switch 2 after a week, or if you've even got one yet.</p>

<p>Join new and familiar friends on a magical adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hot off the heels of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a>, Koei Tecmo revealed it would be releasing another Atelier game. In case you missed it, this time it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> and it's now confirmed to be launching on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release date, a "first look" video has been released including commentary from the game's development team. Players can meet "new and familiar characters of this new magical world" and get a first glimpse at the game system and world they'll be exploring.</p>
<p>Here's the official PR and you can take a look at the developer commentary in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em></strong> takes players on a new mysterious and cosy adventure alongside new characters Rias Eidreise, an adventurer with a talent for alchemy, and Slade Clauslyter, a young man capable of opening entrances to dimensional paths leading to alternate dimensions. These two protagonists will join forces in an attempt to discover the reason for the disappearance of the inhabitants of Hallfein, while also trying to follow in the footsteps of their loved ones and restore their hometown. During their journey, they will meet various characters who will help them, including familiar faces from the Atelier series such as Sophie Nuenmuller, Razeluxe Meitzen, Totori Helmold and Wilbell Voll-Ersleid.</p>
<p>Set in the universe of <em>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator</em>, this new <em>Atelier</em> title will transport players to the continent of Lantarna, where they can explore, gather ingredients for synthesis and discover every secret corner, day or night, rain or shine. Players will also have the opportunity to explore multi-level dungeons, known as “Dimensional Paths”, where the structure will change randomly with each visit, allowing players to gather different ingredients and challenge new enemies depending on the difficulty level chosen.</p>
<p>Fights in <strong><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em></strong> will blend strategy with turn-based combat for strategic timeline command battles where players can form a team of six characters (three in the front line and three in the back). By using action points and equipped items to their advantage, users will be able to inflict damage and influence the timeline of characters’ turns, triggering consecutive turns for allies and activating powerful unite attacks.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Using ingredients gathered during exploration or combat, Rias will be able to synthesise various items during a process called “Gift Colour Synthesis”. During this synthesis process, players will have to connect the “Gift Colours” of the ingredients together to create new items. They will also be able to assign traits or change recipes depending on the ingredients used. When certain characters come to lend Rias a hand, this will further strengthen the item created.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional Atelier gameplay system alternating between exploration, combat and synthesis, users will be able to sell items via Rias’ shop while helping to develop the town. By selling synthesised items, players will earn money they can invest in the development of Hallfein, thus unlocking new recipes and progressing through the main story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you end up purchasing either a digital or physical edition of this game "up to the first two weeks after release" you can also receive the "Activewear Adventuring set" for Ria and Slade, as well as the "Adventuring Charm Set" as an early bonus.</p>
<p>There's no mention of a Nintendo Switch 2 version of this game just yet, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know. And if you haven't played Atelier Yumia yet, you can check out our Nintendo Life review:</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Banaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6208a08d7ff13/donkey-kong-banaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 only arrived last week, but Nintendo is already building up the hype for its next game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, or want something else from the new hardware, this new 3D Donkey Kong will be launching next month on <strong>17th July</strong>. Nintendo has issued a reminder about this via social media, which gives fans another quick glimpse at DK destroying <em>everything</em> in sight and "surfing on a rock".</p>

<p>We went hands on with Donkey Kong Bananza in April and described it as a "brilliantly bonkers" game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Donkey Kong has been living on the sidelines for a while now, Bananza truly is his time to shine, and what we got to play around with was a solid and delightfully stress-relieving bolt of silliness that we desperately need right now. We're hoping there are some more jungly levels out in the wilderness, but this could well be DK's breakout game. And he more than deserves it."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While we wait for DK to arrive, there are plenty of other first and third-party Switch 2 games to enjoy including titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

<p>So, the countdown for DK's 3D outing is officially underway.

<p>According to Piscatella, this is an "all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US", with "over 1.1 million units sold" (week ending June 7, 2025). The previous record was held by Sony's PlayStation 4, and the sales calculated here for the Switch 2 exclude My Nintendo Store purchases.</p>
<p>Additionally, 79% of US buyers purchased the Switch 2 exclusive launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on release – either physically or as part of the system bundle.</p>
<p>On the software front, Mario Kart World is leading Switch 2 physical game sales in this same location, followed by CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in second place, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</a> in third. Unsurprisingly, the new Mario Kart has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">dominated software sales</a> on the Switch 2 in other regions in the first week.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2 had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units globally"</a> in its first four days, making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" ever in this amount of time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/to-a-t-game-keita-takahashi-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've spent the last couple of weeks playing <em>To A T</em>, the latest from Keita Takehashi and his team at Uvala. And I could not have picked a better time to play something that is built from the ground up to bring you nothing but joy.</p><p>You're in control of a 13-year-old who spends their life locked in a T-pose. Which presents some unique challenges, because you can't fit through a lot of doors properly, need help from your dog to brush your teeth and simple acts like eating a sandwich turn into a whole <em>process</em>. If those sound like awfully mundane things to have been made aware of while playing a video game, there's a reason for that: it's exactly the stuff you do in <em>To A T</em>, a game which puts you in such complete control over your character that you have to do everything, from change your shoes to going to the bathroom.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TO A T | Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nD9H6__29A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Imagine if <em>Heavy Rain</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUQZurjxQAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with all its door opening and door closing and egg flipping</a>, was a feel-good cartoon instead of a dreary murder slog. <em>To A T's</em> attention to details really helps ground you in both the place and your character, but more importantly, it centres you on their struggles as well. This is, without making a huge deal of it, a beautiful little tale about disability, a light-hearted way of putting the player in the shoes of someone who is doing their absolute best to live their day despite the constant obstacles (and sometimes even bullying!) in their way.</p><p><em>To A T</em> takes place over a number of episodic days, over which you're slowly introduced to a town, its inhabitants, stores and storyline. I cannot stress how nice it is just to be around it all. The people, the jibberish language everyone speaks, how nice everyone is, the colours, the music–for the past week I have jumped into this idyllic little place every chance I've got and just hung out. Sometimes I'll nudge the story along, sometimes I'll just collect coins and buy a new pair of sneakers for no reason.</p><p>I want to give special praise to the game's bathroom. So much of <em>To A T</em> is about helping you accomplish very set tasks: you can only eat your cereal a certain way, you can only brush your teeth the way the game wants, you have to go to school, etc. But every morning, rain or shine, you need to pee as soon as you get out of bed, and once you get inside the bathroom the guardrails are off. You are<em> let loose</em>. The game's insistence on making you press specific buttons at specific times to complete specific actions gives way to an orchestra of grunts, plops and wet fart noises, as every button on the controller is eventually unlocked and bound to a toilet sound, allowing you to freestyle your own cistern-based symphony</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TO A T | Coming to PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S May 28" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-QlrrC4vFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Oh, and one last cool thing: the game has the most casual way of letting you create your own character, once again without making even the tiniest fuss about the specifics of it. You name them at the start then that's it, as you're then left to choose your own hairstyles and clothing options, change them whenever you want, and the game will never once reference your gender or care what you're wearing.</p><p>The game has some game-shaped issues, sure. Traversing the town is a disorienting nightmare thanks to a bizarre decision to employ a semi-fixed camera that constantly swoops to new positions, and while the minutiae of performing every little task is a fantastic introduction to your character and the world initially, by the time you're drawing near the end of the story it gets a little bit tiring. But the episodic structure of <em>To A T</em>, its length and enormous heart makes those annoyances fairly insignificant. They don't ever get in the way of what the game's really trying to do, which is tell you a cheery and weird little story, spread out over episodes like the best kid's TV show you've ever seen.</p><p>I have not had a great week, alternating between stress and being extremely sick (it's flu season here!), but the one bright spot has been jumping into <em>To A T</em> each night to say hi, explore the happiest town on Earth, eat some sandwiches made fresh every day for me by a giant giraffe and enjoy every second of some of the catchiest theme songs ever written.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright"><h3>Disney’s Big AI Lawsuit Includes Some Very Damning Images</h3></a><p>Disney isn't the only one calling Midjourney a 'bottomless pit of plagiarism'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo"><h3>Dispatch Is A Superhero Logistics Game</h3></a><p>All the paperwork bits instead of the pew-pew bits</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But every now and then, Capcom experiments with something new, to varying degrees of success. And that latest experiment is in Pragmata, a sci-fi third-person shooter that stole the show for me at Summer Game Fest 2025 – even after just a brief 15-minute hands-on demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another sci-fi third-person shooter may not sound too enticing on the surface, but Pragmata is an example of how a single idea can go a long way in distinguishing a game from the rest of the pack. Here’s the thing – in Pragmata you don’t just damage your enemies by shooting them, you have to hack them to open up their weaknesses. The way this works is by aiming down sights and engaging in a hacking minigame where you navigate a five-by-five grid using the face buttons to draw a path that connects specific nodes together. And you have to do this in real-time. Along that path, you can hit additional nodes to inflict status effects or open up weak spots, which can be risky when you’re locked in a room of multiple menacing robots chasing you down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pragmata - Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re nimble enough with your rocket-boosted dodge and smart with your positioning, you can pull this off unscathed, and it is so damn satisfying when it all comes together. When you’re mostly fighting in tight spaces, creating space to hack and shoot can be challenging. Pragmata isn’t exactly a fast-paced game in the same way as Vanquish or Returnal, and it moves more like a Dead Space or Gears of War, and I enjoy that chunky, heavy feel. You’re also not outfitted with a ton of weapons – while you have a six-shot pistol with unlimited magazines, you pick up disposable weapons like a slow, powerful heavy rifle and a Bola gun to temporarily immobilize enemies. These effective, limited-use weapons push you to be more resourceful and make combat more interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since you’re not blasting through waves of robots and drones, the combat encounters feel more deliberate – and I think that’s important for not overdoing it with the hacking minigame. My worry for now is that the novelty of the hacking minigame will wear off the deeper you get into Pragmata, but that’ll be determined by how the gameplay mechanics evolve and the way further combat encounters present new challenges. I’m actually bummed that the demo ends right when you approached a huge mech for what appeared to be a boss fight because it could’ve been an opportunity to showcase more of Pragmata’s potential.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[Capcom's] latest experiment is in Pragmata, a sci-fi third-person shooter that stole the show for me...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hacking is also integrated in environmental puzzles and exploration, presenting you with different styles of sequential button prompts to deactivate security locks or access terminals. Little things like this to break up the pace are important in a fairly linear game where you’re chomping at the bit for the next big fight. You need that variety to balance out even the best parts of a campaign, and I at least enjoy the fact that engaging with levels still revolves around the hacking premise in some form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it be in combat or in exploration, I find a lot of fun in games that give you a more active element to engage with in its core gameplay. Although completely different genres, the timing-based mechanics of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made its turn-based RPG combat feel fresh, and even the gesture-based inputs for abilities in Scarlet Nexus were a fun way to distinguish itself from other action-RPGs, which I still praise to this day. If Pragmata can build on its best ideas in smart ways, it might be able to wedge itself into this conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo didn’t have much in terms of story (and I’m glad it focused on its enticing gameplay hook instead), but it does leave me curious as to what the hell is going on in Pragmata. The basic premise is that you’re stuck on a high-tech space station on the moon, and you control a man named Hugh who dons a mech suit and uses a small arsenal of high-powered firearms, all while a mysterious little girl named Diana, who’s the hacking genius, sits on your shoulders to hack enemies. But even if the story is simply a vehicle to take you through its uniquely thrilling combat scenarios, I’m inclined to believe that’s all it has to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I had no idea what Pragmata was when it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022">first revealed in 2020</a>, and after years of silence and delays, we know that it's real and on its way in 2026. I’m not expecting it to be the next greatest game or become a pillar of Capcom’s catalog, necessarily, but I’m all for new and well-executed ideas – especially at a time when AAA releases sometimes blend with each other.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-might-fill-the-animated-void-cuphead-left-behind<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cuphead did something in 2017 that we'd arguably never seen before in a video game, or at least nowhere near the degree Cuphead went to: it built an entire game around completely hand-drawn art and animation a la a 1930's cartoon. We haven't seen it since probably since doing all of that painstaking visual work by hand is incredibly difficult, time-intensive, and laborious. But now, a new hand-drawn and hand-animated project is getting ready to grace our PCs and consoles. It's called Mouse: P.I. for Hire, and fully handcrafted art is about the only thing it's got in common with Cuphead. Mouse is its own, equally gorgeous game, and after getting a look at a hands-off demo, I'm just as interested in it as I was when I first saw Cuphead. Which is to say, I’m very interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can obviously see, Mouse is in black and white. It's reminiscent of the Steamboat Willy era of early animation, complete with guns that are always wobbling even when they aren't in use, as if they're made of rubber. (More on the guns in a bit.) As you can also plainly see, Mouse is a first-person shooter. In it, you play as Jack Pepper, who in-demand video game voice actor Troy Baker plays with a stereotypical-on-purpose New York accent. He's an early-20th-century gumshoe, after all, see? He's got to sound like one. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What I really liked about the demo I saw of Mouse was that it wasn't just a mindless run-and-gun first-person shooter (not that there's anything wrong with that). Instead, the mission I saw part of was set at an opera house, where Pepper had to find and question the stage designer. We started at the back door, where we spoke to a waiter and asked about Roland, the aforementioned stage designer. He hasn’t seen him, so in we go to investigate for ourselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What I really liked about the demo I saw of Mouse was that it wasn't just a mindless run-and-gun first-person shooter.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside, the kitchen gives you a better look at the visual aesthetic at play here. Notice how the characters are 2D within the 3D space, not unlike the monsters in the original Doom. A peek through the porthole window of the kitchen door shows off one of Mouse’s detective-y features: reconnaissance, as Jack takes a photo and sees some members of the Big Mouse Party – aka not guys we want anything to do with.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving to the back of the kitchen, we meet up with a slick waiter who’s happy to help sneak us upstairs to where we need to go quietly – for $30. We decline the bribe and instead find a vent we can sneak through. A bonus stash of cash hiding in the vent is appreciated, but the bottom falling out of the vent, crash-landing us back outside where we started, is very much not appreciated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attempt number two takes us back through the kitchen and into the same vent, carefully crawling around the newly made hole in the floor and taking us to the dressing room, where a Thompson machine gun and some ammo await. You’re not supposed to be in here, of course, and the Big Mouse Party members don’t take kindly to your presence. It’s here that we get our first look at the first-person shooter combat, including one of the gorgeous reload animations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We hear a muffled voice that might be Roland, but first a safe gives us a chance to see the lockpicking minigame in action, along with what the safe was hiding: a cup of coffee? Then things get really loud, as the wall in front of us blows up and we have to snuff out the bad guy that emerges from the smoke before using TNT ourselves to make a hole in the floor so we can make our way down into the bowels of the opera house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we’ve found Roland. He’s been beaten up by the extras, who Jack deduces aren’t extras at all, and learns the Big Mouse Party’s real plan: to assassinate mayoral candidate Stilton, who’s sitting in the balcony for that evening’s show, during intermission, using the cannon on stage that is both full of live ammo and pointed directly at him. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward to more combat, including the shotgun, which looks like it packs a nice wallop – and also has a pretty awesome reload animation of its own. Plus a look at explosive barrels that leave the bad guys burning in the most cartoonish way possible. There’s even an ice barrel – liquid nitrogen, perhaps? – that freezes nearby foes when detonated, allowing you to kick them so they shatter into a thousand pieces, Terminator 2-style. Moments later we also got a look at the third weapon featured in the demo: the turpentine gun, which melts these cartoon characters who are literally made of paint, not unlike the Dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The turpentine gun melts these cartoon characters who are literally made of paint, not unlike the Dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a bit of platforming and fighting a new helicopter-tailed enemy type, we found our way back upstairs…only to have a trap door below our feet open up, dumping us back into the basement. It’s here we meet the Old Rat Stuntman, who teaches Jack the double-jump maneuver. After testing it out and discovering a secret – a baseball trading card of “Brie” Ruth (get it, because they’re mice and love cheese?) – we find our way back on stage to sabotage the cannon and save Stilton, which triggers a boss battle with a raging opera performer. The turpentine gun finishes him off, and we get a look at its reload animation, which if you ask me is even cooler than the others we’ve already seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The fire from the stage has spread to the rest of the opera house, and we’ve gotta get out of here. But we’re going to have to shoot our way out using every weapon at our disposal. No problem for Jack Pepper. Let’s watch some combat now, uninterrupted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally escaping the building, we meet up with the stage designer, who coughs up what he knows about the performer who’s vanished. Something about a secret lab underneath his mansion? No, that doesn’t sound suspicious at all… And with that, we exit the level and the demo ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, though I haven’t yet played it myself, from what I’ve seen of Mouse – and you just saw most of what I saw – I’m really eager to give it a try. It seems like it’s got the right lighthearted, somewhat comedic tone while also being self-aware but offering a solid first-person shooter at the core of it. After all, as gorgeous and admirable as its hand-drawn art and animation are, if the gameplay can’t back it up and also maintain my interest in it over the course of its campaign, then it won’t really matter how pretty it is. But at this point, I’m extremely optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I play a lot of competitive shooters – and I mean <em>a lot</em> of competitive shooters. Whether it’s being an unfortunate son in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review"><u>Grey Zone Warfare</u></a>, flipping cards in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-review"><u>FragPunk</u></a>, or smashing and grabbing  in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-review"><u>The Finals</u></a>, this has been my default “gaming night with the friends” genre since I was in school many, many (many) years ago. And even after many thousands of hours spread across Destiny, Call of Duty, Halo Infinite, and Valorant, there is something about the action on the Rainbow Six series that stands out and just feels right. Now that Rainbow Six Siege is celebrating its tenth year with a massive new update in the form of Rainbow Six Siege X, it seems like a perfect time to reevaluate how this popular tactical shooter stands among its peers after a decade of tweaks, updates, and additions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fundamentals of Siege are as strong as ever, which is great to see. Bomb is the headliner mode: Two teams take turns on offense and defense trying to either fortify position and protect a bomb, or battle their way in to defuse it. That setup has been around for decades (and is also the core mode of games like Counter-Strike) but Siege’s distinctive entrenchment and destruction mechanics make its version stand out, and both sides of that coin are extremely fun. I love throwing down a bunch of temporary walls, setting up razor wire or other boobie traps, and getting ready to ambush attackers. And it’s just as satisfying on offense, knowing the other team has set up similar defenses, and blowing a wall open with some thermite to bypass all of it and get the drop on the enemy. The fast time-to-kill rewards position over twitch skill, and I appreciate the way the relatively slow aim-down-sites animation forces you to decide before a fight how you want to engage. This is a thinking man’s shooter, through and through. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cast of playable characters is an impressive 75 Operators. Each has a different loadout and slightly unique playstyle, with half reserved for Attackers and the other playable only when you are on Defense. They do a great job catering to different playstyles, whether you want to smash through walls with your big hammer as Sledge, or dash around at high speed as Oryx. It is surprising that the Siege X update didn’t add anyone new to the roster, though we did get Rauora just a few months ago. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dual Front mode hasn’t yet grown on me in the time I’ve spent with it so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Bomb, Siege X adds a new 6v6 mode called Dual Front, but that one hasn’t yet grown on me in the time I’ve spent with it so far. Here, both teams have an area to attack and another to defend simultaneously. There are no restrictions on what type of character you can use, though only 37 of the 75 operators are eligible selections. The single available map is enormous, which, combined with the fast time-to-kill of Siege, means you tend to spend just a very small fraction of the match duration involved in actual action. Unlike in Bomb you can respawn after you die, which seems like it would make this a good mode for onboarding new players, but so far I feel like it really just takes away the pulse-pounding stakes that make Siege what it is. </p><div id="rank-rainbow-six-siege-xs-operators" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Rainbow Six Siege X's Operators</h3><h3>Rank Rainbow Six Siege X's Operators</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege X is built around a limited free-to-play model. I say limited because, while you can absolutely play Siege X for free, it locks some key modes, like Ranked and Siege Cup, behind a paywall. You’ll need to spend around $20 USD if you want access to those. That seems like an odd choice for something that already has a robust shop and battle pass system for generating money, particularly when other popular games, like Marvel Rivals, don’t do any such segmentation between paid and unpaid players. The community has long been a bit weary of how slow progression and a protracted Operator unlock pace push people towards the paid battle pass, but with the revamps in Siege X I still need to spend more time unlocking things to get a feel for how much better or worse that has gotten. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the hallmarks of Siege has always been the way you can punch through walls.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hallmarks of Siege has always been the way you can punch through walls, breach barriers, or come crashing down through the ceiling into your assault, but that feels like it could’ve used an update for this relaunch. For all the walls you can Kool-Aid Man through, there are still a surprising amount of invincible barriers, like thick walls, certain window coverings, and any sort of furniture that make its destruction system less flexible than a more modern game might be. This is especially true on rooftop maps, which limit your options for a vertical breach to the small number of predetermined access points. Those limitations really stand out when other games that’ve come along since Siege first paved the way let you smash through almost anything. I’m not saying Siege needs to let you literally bring down the house, but the fact that I can’t throw some thermite under the bomb and drop it through the floor like I can with the bank in The Finals really sticks out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent audio system, especially headphones, has always been an advantage in Siege thanks to its outstanding sound design, and Siege X has noticeably improved it. Explosions and gunfire sound as great as ever, but it’s the ability to locate the general direction of sounds really impresses me. It’s always been handy for finding enemies trying to get the drop on you, but the revamped soundscape now feeds a lot more detail into it. The most significant difference I’ve heard is in footsteps above and below you – once you learn to recognize the difference between the boomy noise above versus the more hollowed-out sounds below you can start to close your eyes and pinpoint exactly where threats will come from, which is such a cool gameplay-based reward for paying attention to the details. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Justin's favorite multiplayer shooters</h3><p>Fragging is better with friends, and these are the best games for it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other extremely situational upgrades I quite like. Rappelling is one of the most fun offensive options in Siege X: Hanging upside down like a tactical Spider-Man and getting the drop on enemies watching stairways and doors is supremely satisfying, though until now the actual usefulness in combat has always been somewhat limited. That’s because the rope has tended to leave you a sitting duck – or a pinata – if the enemy sees you. But new options to sprint along the wall or jump around corners means getting spotted isn’t instant death, and I’ve found myself using it a lot more as a result. On top of that, new destructible objects like gas pipes and fire extinguishers can be shot to create jets of flame or smoke. It’s extremely rare for that to matter in a fight, but it does have a very cool cinematic flair with just a touch of area control that I really appreciate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, I’m still early enough in my return to Siege that I’m not quite ready to render a final verdict on its new iteration. I can certainly say that Siege X is a lot of fun to play, and mastering every Operator will be enough to keep me busy for the long haul. I’m a big fan of most of the new additions like the improved sound design, more mobile rappelling, and destructible elements, though at this point I don’t know if Dual Front will be a destination mode – I need to give it more time to gel before I write it off. Overall, I think this a solid step forward that I’m eager to keep playing and evaluating, so stay tuned for the full review next week.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2021 relaunch of Splitgate solidified that Valve-style portals and old-school arena shooters are two great tastes that taste great together. Splitgate 2 carries that same great melding of run-and-gun action and tactical trickery that helped the original plant its flag in the genre, so it’s starting from a good place. However, even though the addition of character classes and a wider range of weapons help bring Splitgate 2 through a new threshold of promise, some of the other shots it takes through the looking glass come back to bite it and have made me a bit less optimistic about the time I’ve spent with this free-to-play followup so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, quite a bit has changed relative to the original. Gone is the muted, more industrial look of the battle venues, replaced by lots of vibrant colors and brighter lighting, making it look less distinctive and more like the many games trying to catch the eye of Fortnite players. In the trade up from the grubby metal walls to the cleaner, sleeker surfaces, Splitgate 2 is also absent of the more interesting features that made the original’s maps interesting and memorable. Features like deserts and trees that would be smack-dab in the middle of a map (like in one of my favorites, Oasis) are now relegated to background decorations, and every surface you’ll actually run and gun across feels samey across the 15 map options. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The returning map creator mode, now called The Lab, is powerful enough that it’s already filled with dozens and dozens of fan-made recreations of famous PvP maps from bigger games, alongside some more interesting and original user creations that serve as great side shows to the main action. But they are often too gimmicky to be considered good replacements for the developer-made maps as far as having consistent and competitive rounds of the standard modes (to the extent that's possible considering there’s no ranked mode currently available). I had a pretty hard time getting strangers to queue for some of the wackier-looking options, often sitting in lobbies alone for long periods of time in hopes some other curious Splitgaters would stumble in. I was often disappointed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Splitgate 2’s biggest win, though, is in gameplay tweaks that have a huge impact on pacing from match to match. The signature portals are still the X-factor, allowing you to create paths between two points on the map on the fly. They are the perfect tools for setting up ambushes, tricky getaways, and even manipulating physics to slingshot you across the map. I mostly use them here like I did in 2021, pulling off one-man flanks on jerks attempting to take my team's objectives. This time, though, it only takes one button to create both ends of your personal wormhole when shot in succession, making them much more convenient to use. It comes at a slight cost, in that opening one of your portals on top of an enemy’s is the only way to close theirs, and that can force you to close off your own routes. But after logging 10 hours this week, I much prefer this minor drawback over the anti-portal grenades of yesteryear.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It only takes one button to create both ends of your portal, making them much more convenient to use.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Movement always felt smooth, quick, and controlled in Splitgate thanks to its fast (but not too fast) sprinting and the limited jetpacks. In Splitgate 2, both of these things combine with a new slide mechanic to make getting around the maps feel like I remember my best rounds of Titanfall. The jetpack seems more powerful, with more lift before cooldown than the original’s version. Being able to stay aloft for longer means firefights more often begin or end in the air, adding a level of dynamism that makes every skirmish a challenge at every angle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The arsenal isn’t much different than the original, though, which is a shame because it’s not very imaginative. Most weapons have slick futuristic curves and color schemes but function exactly like the assault rifles, SMGs, and carbines you’ve wielded in other games, and I wasn’t motivated to do much exploration of the options or customization of loadout presets because of it. They really just make me want to sprint to grab power weapons, which spawn with some fanfare on neutral points during matches, as soon as possible. These returning super guns have gotten a couple of notable additions to their lineup, including my favorite: a pair of machine pistols that can be combined to form a longer machine gun when aiming down the sights. These are all awesome, game-changing weapons that are worth the effort to secure every time they’re available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, the biggest change to the way Splitgate 2 plays is the addition of three character classes, avatars of competing corporate entities who settle their differences in this futuristic sport of gun-toting portal slipping. Sabrask, Meridian, and Aeros all have their own unique active abilities, like Sabrask’s Smart Wall, which plops a one-way bullet shield that protects anyone standing behind it while being free to shoot through it at the enemy (much like non-portable version of Reinhardt’s shield in Overwatch). They each also have passive effects that they can grant their whole team simply by being present, incentivizing teams to have at least one of each in play. That means actives are more obviously impactful than the passives, largely because I’ve yet to play a game where every team involved wasn’t receiving boosted health regen from Meridian and faster ability and equipment recharges from Aeros and Sabrask, respectively. Is it really a “boost” if it’s basically the standard?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think there’s an argument to be made that the choice to forgo class-based, hero shooter-y design was a keystone of the monument to the past’s simpler shooters that the original Splitgate was building. It meant every player started from the same base capabilities and had to earn every advantage during a match. I am sympathetic to this old-school Halo-style mentality, but I've come to prefer the diversity of these three new classes, which add just enough tactical expression to give old people like me a chance against fast-twitch no-scoping youth so long as I can out-think them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a bummer that these new modes rely on isolatingly large spaces.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Matches, regardless of which of the suite of returning modes you’re playing, are almost always more fun on smaller maps, which may not be as interesting as they were in Splitgate but at least are built to take the most advantage of portaling in a way that ensures you’re never too far from the action. Larger maps, like the ones found in the new three team, 24-player Onslaught game types that supersize Team Deathmatch and Hotzone, can feel almost lonely because you have to run a fair distance to find some other players exchanging fire before plotting your portal game. It’s a bummer then that all of these new modes rely on increasingly isolatingly large play spaces.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Splitgate 2 Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the board, it strikes me as odd that maps seem to deemphasize the advantage that using portals would have – so many objectives sit in places completely hidden from a portal wall, and it felt much more difficult to use portals for aggressive pushes. Fortunately for me, someone who mostly uses portals to set traps and for escapes, and I felt like Splitgate 2’s layouts firmly establish that my more passive approach is the right way to play. Firstly, thank you so much 1047 Games, but secondly, this means that offensive strikes on objectives, especially the ones you have to hunker down on like in Firecracker or Domination, happen with the kinds of jetpack assaults and high-energy flanks that you could do anywhere else. Even modes that require lots of movement or rotating objectives, like Splitball and Hotzone, don’t afford many more opportunities to use the feature in a way that couldn’t be done without it. The most damning realization of this came when I was playing one of the No Portals limited-time playlist maps and realizing my games didn’t feel all that different without them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the big new marquee feature of Splitgate 2 is the battle royale mode, which at the time of this writing, I haven’t spent too much time with (hence why this review is still in progress). But from what I have played, it operates mostly as expected: many teams of four drop into a semi-random zone on the map and fight each other to be the last squad standing. The wrinkle it adds to the genre (besides portals) is that the greater map is made up of four smaller maps connected to one another by jump paths and tunnels. Splitgate 2’s version of the storm closing in around you is shutting down one of these regions, forcing all surviving squads toward each other in a shrinking set of rooms. These maps are styled as different environments – there's a snowy zone and a lava zone, for instance – so it’s easy to communicate which one you’re talking about when planning with your team. I haven’t noticed if these zones have too many differences from one another outside of how they look, though. Does the lava burn you? Does the ice make you slide uncontrollably? I’ll report back when I wrap up this review next week.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
