<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160592/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/indika">Indika</a> I’d call one of the most singularly audacious narrative exploration games in recent memory, a daring title that defies easy classification with its surrealist flourishes, cinematic art direction, and cynical inversion of familiar video game mechanics. Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch version isn’t it.</p>
<p>Part spiritual tragicomedy, part psychological fever-dream, developers Odd Meter deliver what is essentially a playable crisis of faith, one shackled to a deeply compromised port so crash-prone and visually mangled at times that it’s very hard to recommend in its current state, even as the story underneath it all is nothing short of compelling.</p>
<p>Between missing assets, localisation glitches, heavily compromised cutscene quality, and repeated crashes, this port undermines the very things that make Indika special. Indeed, you could be forgiven for wanting to brute-force your way through its five-hour runtime despite its performance issues just to see this heady, thought-provoking tale through to its conclusion.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160581/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game puts you in control of Indika, a meek young nun eking out a bleak existence in a frigid Tsarist-era Russian convent. She’s loathed by the other sisters and treated like a workhorse. As you mundanely haul potatoes and fetch water, a sardonic disembodied voice begins to chime in, one that the game’s own marketing nudges you to interpret as the devil himself.</p>
<p>Whether this force — a tormentor and commentator who pries at her doubts, teasing her with sexual temptation and needling the hollowness of her performative piety — is a literal demon or simply her own intrusive thoughts is left to you to decide. In any case, Indika’s spiritual reckoning eschews shallow blasphemy for its own sake and has real philosophical heft.</p>
<p>The game’s writing is sharper than you might initially expect, with characters that would not be out of place in a Dostoyevsky novel pondering the uneasy nature of free will, the hierarchies of sin, and the mysteries of the human soul. Indika likewise revels in weaponising tedious gameplay as a punchline in its critique of the structures that shape belief itself.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moment-to-moment play involves light environmental puzzles that are rarely challenging. You’ll push a safe on wheels to tilt a crumbling building so a piano slides into position beneath a window to create a path, operate machinery in a fish factory and other industrial locales, and manipulate walkways by holding the prayer button to make bridges appear or vanish.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of flashback sequences rendered in pixel art that function as playable memories of Indika’s life before the convent. These segments include minigame challenges that range from isometric bike racing and small platforming challenges in a 'repeat until you get the timing right' format. But the controls don’t feel intuitive and take a moment to adjust to.</p>
<p>These sections are the most overtly video-gamey parts of Indika, and the tonal whiplash between the colourful, retro-styled recollections and solemn 3D hyper-realism of the main campaign and its staid 'walking simulator' segments — slow back and forth traversal between a well and a crate, turning a wheezing crank with an awkward analogue rotation — are by design.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160590/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Layered on top of this is a deliberately useless skill tree that levels up shame, grief, guilt, repentance, and so on with points gained from pious things such as lighting candles to illuminate religious icons, finding relics, and dutifully completing chores. At one point, the game straight-up tells you not to bother collecting points because they’re <em>pointless</em>.</p>
<p>No one who plays Indika will rave about its gameplay, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying being in its world. As you trek between convent, village, and industrial sites, you hear snow crunch underfoot, howling wind, distant gunshots, and a woman sobbing somewhere out of sight. Interiors of abandoned peasant homes are richly detailed, illuminated in flickering candlelight.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is strikingly anachronistic, weaving lo-fi electronic ambience with flashes of club-tinged breakbeats and synth textures that collide with droning Orthodox chant. There are voiceovers in both British English and Russian. Playing with a Russian voiceover and English subtitles felt like the more immersive option to me, though both languages are well-performed.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160591/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, if you have access to another platform, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/indika">play it there</a>. Whether running on original Switch hardware or a Switch 2, this version is simply a mess. Across my playthrough, I experienced four hard crashes that would sometimes dump me back at the start of a level, and the game often reloaded in a broken state where your companion character and their dialogue would fail to spawn, leaving only their subtitles on screen.</p>
<p>There were also sections where subtitles failed to show up entirely. Scenes that previously featured music would reload in total silence while NPCs continued to dance. Between transitions from gameplay to cutscenes, the screen would consistently flash odd glitch frames for a split second; this was not intentional stylisation but a persistent artifacting error.</p>
<p>Visually, the Switch version is seriously compromised, and comparing key scenes to footage from other versions is disheartening. During standard gameplay, environments are serviceable if a little soft, but the cutscenes — crucial for a game this cinematic — often look like a smudged and muddy PS2 game. There are entire visual motifs that are entirely lost on Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160587/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game pixelates shadows during a certain intimate moment in a callback to Indika’s past, but this could barely be discerned due to the poor resolution and contrast. In at least one sequence, the lighting was so dark on Switch that a major visual beat initially went unnoticed. Elsewhere, over-bright lighting makes an unsettling character close-up suffer badly.</p>
<p>Visuals take an even more dramatic hit in handheld mode with a <em>significant</em> drop in fidelity that’s hard to overlook. The handheld image is so soft and low-res that environmental details smear into indistinct muddy gradients, leaving scenes that often resemble an early-2000s game struggling under heavy post-processing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s a shame that a game as idiosyncratic and thematically dense as Indika arrives on Switch in such a dire state. Its story and ideas linger long after the credits, offering plenty to reflect on. Still, this version is marred at every turn by technical shortcomings and visual compromises that diminish the impact of an experience that deserves far better.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-early-access-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-preview-the-pursuit-of-becoming-the-best-dungeon-master.1355869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Digital Sun has returned to deliver <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, the anticipated sequel to their 2018 action RPG roguelike, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>, which launches into Early Access for PC via Steam, PC Game Pass, and the Microsoft Store. The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">intended to release <em>Moonlighter 2</em> on 23rd October 2025</a>; however, due to a plethora of great gaming releases that month, the developer moved its release to November.</p>

<p>According to the developer, the game is expected to release its full version for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">all platforms, including consoles</a>, at a date to be announced at a later time. But for the time being, we get to enjoy our time as a relic shopkeeper named Will, who has to make his way in a distant village and earn coin to his name while uncovering secrets about an ancient artifact that appeared in Tresna.</p>

<h2>All Hands Back On Deck At The Moonlighter</h2>

<p>Players who have yet to be introduced to the <em>Moonlighter</em> series, the first game took place in Rynoka, where they followed a young orphaned boy, Will, who set off on an adventure by exploring various dungeons located near his home. Exploring these dungeons allowed Will to acquire relics of different rarities, which he brought back to his family shop called the Moonlighter; however, one such discovery was a corpse with a peculiar note suggesting that there are four keys to be acquired from four guardians.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=ze3hfCnm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=s8S90mO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't worry if you haven't played Moonlighter as the opening scene for Moonlighter 2 recounts the events from the first game!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>After collecting those keys, unlocking the final dungeon, discovering interdimensional shenanigans, and encountering a government organization, Will returns home with the news of no longer being able to explore these dungeons again. This is where the sequel, <em>The Endless Vault,</em> picks up the story as Will finds himself in a new location, the vibrant village of Tresna, with new and familiar allies to be acquainted with and dungeons to explore.</p>

<p>As for the story, well, Will and a few other villagers have found themselves stranded in Tresna due to ongoing events in Rynoka, which are preventing them from returning home, and Will can learn more about them by accepting quests and progressing with the game itself! But as we're starting over with no coin to our name, it's back to business as we must discover and clear dungeons to seek our priceless relics to sell in our little shop (yes, The Moonlighter shop is back)!</p>

<p>Aside from exploring and clearing dungeons, finding precious treasures, and selling them in their shop, Will will be given opportunities to upgrade his weapons, armor, and perks, and acquire stunning pieces of furniture and decor items for the shop. Then there's the mysterious appearance of an ancient artifact, known only as The Endless Vault, providing a unique set of challenges and rewards for Will to take on.</p>

<p>Progress through the game in its opening hours to learn that it provides Will with a series of challenges, and after meeting its requirements, it will offer a reward and continue with these challenges for higher rewards. This reward will be valuable, especially as it can help boost the town's prosperity through upgrades that not only increase the town's morale but also enhance the wealth to be shared among the villagers.</p>

<h2>Battling Upon The Heat Of The Dungeons</h2>

<p>Once again, we'll remind players that the game is launching in Early Access, so technical issues, bugs, and glitches are to be expected during this period, as the developer will continue working on the game right up until its eventual full release. Nevertheless, in terms of gameplay, there aren't many differences between <em>Moonlighter</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>; however, both games stand out in offering unique and refreshing takes on the action RPG roguelike genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=1lC-ohLW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=6VrPop9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players (and Will) are sure to encounter some unique enemies and mini bosses during the dungeon run so be on the alert!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of <em>Moonlighter 2</em> is the quest to seek out precious treasures and relics that are at the center of the gameplay loop, as players will be actively spending most of their time defeating rooms of enemies to obtain them. During our hands-on experience, we immediately knew that no two dungeon clears will ever be the same, as each time players step inside a dungeon, the layout will procedurally change.</p>

<p>Each layout will feature a combination of Uncommon and Rare chests, weapon perks, unique dungeon events, blacksmith upgrades, and plenty of Elite enemies, mini bosses, and the dungeon boss to encounter. This allowed us to spend as much time in the first dungeon to get accustomed to the controls and combat mechanics to master clearing rooms without taking as much damage as possible, learn every enemy attack, and, of course, acquire as many relics and other treasures returning to the shop and sell them to customers (more on that later).</p>

<p>When embarking on a new dungeon run, every room will be randomized, and once cleared, they can follow its predetermined route by selecting which room to explore and learn what lies ahead, indicated by a map legend provided. Every room will have unique traps that can assist players, like fly traps, to knock enemies into them by using their backpack or attacking plants&nbsp;that will fire projectiles at enemies for extra offense.</p>

<p>These new enemies are no pushovers either (as implied by our death count), as players will encounter a myriad of adorable and imposing enemies that will attempt to prevent players from reaching the treasure at the room's exit. Luckily, there are perks to acquire for their weapons and their combat skills by exploring the Perk Rooms, which grant them unique buffs and status effects to inflict, which, personally, we do love the Wound (bleed) effect on our sword and gun, which helped us clear enemies more efficiently in our runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=GWxOko6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=FSu-JLvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We sure do love a good Bleed build if you wish to inflict additional damage to enemies with the Wound status effect.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>But do watch out, as the survivability will also be tested, as once the health has been depleted, players can opt to restart their dungeon run or return "home" to sell their acquired loot at the Moonlighter shop. Unlike the first game, players won't have to worry about losing their found relics and treasures should they fall in combat, as all items will lose some rarity stars, but also, armored relics will lose their shield too, a slight change from Moonlighter that players should be pleased about.</p>

<h2>Shop Til You Drop!</h2>

<p>Now, the game's perfect blend of shopkeeping and roguelike mechanics is what drew many players to the first game and will likely do the same for the sequel. The developers aimed at improving the formula by retaining most of what worked in <em>Moonlighter</em> and adjusted it for the sequel with the addition of new features to make the shopkeeping gameplay aspect more rewarding, like customization options, strategic decision-making through systems like resource management, and the aforementioned varied yet dynamic dungeon runs.</p>

<p>Yes, players can finally customize The Moonlighter shop after obtaining the K33PER bot, which offers various services to Will when interacting with the bot inside the shop. Players can rearrange the layout of display floor cases, place unique decor pieces that can improve the items' rarity or boost their pricing, change the wall and flooring, and more, as these options can be acquired by either finding recipes within the dungeons or spending Blob Vouchers by talking to Ms. Scratch.</p>

<p>Lastly, players will be able to gain temporary perks available at the cash register when making sales at The Moonlighter, and these can vary between gaining tips on top of sales, adding more rarity stars to their precious relics, or boosting Gold when making sales. Like with <em>Moonlighter</em>, players will get a feel for their customers when it comes to pricing their discovered treasures by adjusting the prices to see what appeases them before allowing them to leave as a satisfied customer with their desired item and a bargain, of course.</p>

<h2>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=sdd6A-Km 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=ZdVfL_6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Even during a dungeon run, there's always time for a quick splash in a healing pool.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> has a strong start to its Early Access launch based on what developer Digital Sun has produced for players. Over the course of this preview, we've found a rhythm of delving into dungeons to clear out enemies, discover recipes, and valuable crafting materials, but also pushing our limits on survivability on every run.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, no dungeon run is the same, as the procedural generation makes our time spent in the dungeon all that exciting but equally terrifying with the enemies we may or may not encounter. The perks available in these dungeons do help in defeating all more efficiently, but now and then, we experienced some technical errors, from input latency bugs to general performance issues, but it wasn't prolonged enough to drop us out of the game entirely.</p>

<p>Outside of exploring dungeons, we poured plenty of time into rearranging our shop layout, placing unique decor pieces to increase our sales and item rarity, which was a great change of pace, gameplay-wise, and the developers did a marvelous job of being able to strike a balance between dungeon crawling and shopkeeping.</p>

<p>With <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> is still in development while in Early Access, we'll be pushing our limits as a merchant and combative hero as we have found a new roguelike experience since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">Blue Prince</a> to put multiple hours into by meticulously working out our pricing guide and resource management, mastering enemy and boss attack patterns, and reaping the rewards of our successes.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault </em></strong><em>was previewed on PC over the course of 12 hours with a code provided by the developer - all screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.</em></p>

But the company claims it’s open to giving you store credit for some unexpected items.</p>

 <p>It’s a common-enough joke on the internet that GameStop’s trade-in values for even the latest games are pretty abysmal. But the advertisement for the “Trade Anything Day” features everything from a mug, to a taxidermied squirrel, to a lonely leather boot. “Bring Whatever, Get Store Credit” the ad reads, with “No Questions Asked” written at the bottom, modified to say “<i>Some</i> Questions Asked.*”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gabe-newell-500-million-yacht-new-buy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gabe-newell-just-bought-a-new-500-million-yacht-with-a-basketball-court-and-%E2%80%9915-gaming-stations%E2%80%99.1355854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve and a multi-billionaire gaming legend, has secured a brand-new yacht, custom-built to his desires and fitted with a whopping fifteen ‘gaming stations.’ What’s the betting that at least one of them features a Steam Machine?</p>



<p>The ‘high-performance vessel’ will reportedly support ‘everything from world-class hospitality to scientific research’, as the yacht is equipped with a <strong>science lab and dive center</strong>, amongst other things. The 360-foot, hybrid beast chalked up a production cost of between $375 and $530 million, proving that Gaben is eating <strong>well</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-valve-on-the-open-seas">Valve on the Open Seas</h2>



<p>Gabe Newell, the eclectic founder of Valve, is said to be worth more than $10 billion. He spends most of his time <strong>living </strong>aboard yachts, and his recent addition to his collection, the ‘Leviathan’, is simply another arrow in the quiver of ocean-faring palaces.</p>



<p>It’s the 50th largest yacht in the world, custom-built to match everything that Newell desired, and in a statement, the Valve head honcho gushed over the creation of the thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Working with the team at Oceanco is incredibly enjoyable and a lot of fun; everybody is professional, creative and dynamic. We knew we were asking for unusual things, and Oceanco embraced it with open arms. Not only have we designed a very unusual yacht that leans into Oceanco’s strengths of innovation and design, but the team has also been willing to collaborate with us on evolving the process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It could also have been one hell of a tax swindle, given that Gabe Newell <strong>owns Oceanco</strong>, the shipyard that built the Leviathan, but that’s just a silly thing to say.</p>



<p>The Leviathan features a submarine garage, more than a dozen premium gaming PCs, racing sim rigs, a basketball court, a hospital, and more bedrooms, kitchens, and relaxation areas than you can shake a stick at. It has been dubbed the most comfortable yacht ever designed, and it certainly seems like it <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the yacht’s brochure</a>.</p>



<p>And in true gamer form, it’s surrounded by a ring of RGB lights.</p>



<p>This one-of-a-kind vessel will serve several purposes and won’t necessarily be Gaben’s new home, but it’s nice to know he has his pick of the lot when it comes to hyper-expensive boats.</p>







<p>Recently, Valve revealed a slew of new gaming devices, including a new Steam Deck, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/">a Steam Machine</a>, and the Frame, a new virtual reality headset.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since its announcement, Mega Evolution's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-where-to-buy">Phantasmal Flames expansion</a> has ignited immediate interest across both competitive circles and the secondary market in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a>, and it’s stronger than ever with the launch of the full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">English set on November 14</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Mega Evolutions roaring back into prominence thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, and several cards offering unusually high ceiling damage or strong search power, the set has already produced an early hierarchy of valuable heavy-hitters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7M0e8?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, certain cards have already skyrocketed further in price, and, following up from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution round-up</a>, we’ve ranked the ten most expensive cards so far in Phantasmal Flames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From aggressive Mega attackers to powerful evolution support, Phantasmal Flames brings a fiery mix of competitive threats and high-demand pulls. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, Mega Lopunny ex offers top-tier tempo, Sharpedo ex delivers huge burst damage, and Dawn provides unmatched consistency for evolution decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the set’s true centrepieces are the three Mega Charizard X ex prints: with all of them sporting the powerful Inferno X attack, and commanding serious prices.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Lopunny ex – 115/094 (Ultra Rare)</h2><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230505"><div id="230505" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lopunny ex - 115/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting off the list is the standard Ultra Rare print of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRvgD?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lopunny ex</a>, and along with its colourfuly imposing art, it's no surprise if this card ends up a hit in the  in the current format. Gale Thrust may begin at 60, but if Mega Lopunny moved from the Bench to the Active Spot that turn, it jumps to 230 damage, which is an excellent rate for a single Colourless attachment. It slots neatly into pivot-based lists utilising switching loops or mobility engines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Spiky Hopper hits for 160 and ignores all effects on the opponent’s Active Pokemon, granting a clean answer to walls and defensive techs. Low costs, high numbers, and flexible deck compatibility keep this card’s value comfortably afloat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Piplup – 098/094 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230504"><div id="230504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Piplup - 098/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVElnJ?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Piplup</a> is a non-ex Basic, it enters the list because Call for Support is one of the strongest turn-one stabilisers the set provides. Being able to search any Supporter directly from the deck without drawback improves the early consistency of almost any list that can afford to include it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This kind of tutoring power is frequently undervalued in pre-release environments but becomes highly prized once decks tighten up. Most importantly, though, its winter-themed art by Hideki Ishikawa  — showing a slightly sad and lonely Piplup under a cliff, is simply adorable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between its splashable typing and immediate effect on turn sequencing, Piplup’s competitive utility easily justifies its early demand.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Meowth – 106/094 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230503"><div id="230503" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meowth 106/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meowth’s Fury Swipes attack is simple but mathematically solid for a Colourless Basic. At 20 damage per heads across three flips, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3vE8?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meowth</a> can occasionally push early pressure without requiring specific Energy types. In today’s meta, where some decks prefer low-investment starters that can chip for tempo, this puts Meowth on the radar as a flexible opener.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst not format-defining, cards that slot seamlessly into evolving or toolbox-style lists often find stable market interest, and the Illustration Rare for this Meowth with its mischievous-looking aesthetic is no exception.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Rotom ex – 126/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230502"><div id="230502" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rotom ex - 126/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rotom ex stands out because of its Multi Adapter ability, which allows each of your Rotom-named Pokemon to hold two Pokemon Tools. That alone opens up unique strategies involving damage modifiers, switching aids, or defensive attachments,essentially doubling the efficiency of Tool-based engines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its attack, Thunderbolt, hits for a respectable 130 in exchange for discarding all Energy. While not remarkable on its own, it becomes meaningful in lists built to recycle Energy or continuously buff damage through stacked Tools. At around $43 at the time of writing, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwgNw?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rotom's</a> competitive ceiling explains why its value is climbing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Mega Sharpedo ex – 127/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230501"><div id="230501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Sharpedo ex - 127/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Sharpedo ex brings an unusually threatening combination of draw power and burst damage. Greedy Fang drawing two cards keeps your engine moving, but it’s Hungry Jaws that has truly caught players’ attention. Starting at 120 and climbing to 270 damage if Sharpedo has any damage counters, the attack synergises perfectly with self-damage enablers and predictable chip from switching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darkness decks love aggression, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjgWb?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Sharpedo ex</a> delivers it at an appealing rate, along with the artwork of this Special Illustration Rare being strikingly agrresive, too. It is already being viewed as a centrepiece for future archetypes, hence its high price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mega Lopunny ex – 128/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230500"><div id="230500" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lopunny ex - 128/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp1AM?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lopunny ex</a> maintains the exact same competitive toolkit as the Ultra Rare but has surged further in value due to its importance in mobility-focused strategies, and its impactful illustration After all, the ability to consistently hit for 230 with a single Energy and a switch effect makes Lopunny one of the most Energy-efficient attackers in the set, but 5ban Graphics' artwork kicks this card up a notch,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s along with Spiky Hopper giving Mega Lopunny a reliable second option when facing tankier builds. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mega Charizard X ex – 109/094 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230499"><div id="230499" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 109/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Inferno X, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrxDZ?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> enters the meta as one of the scariest late-game sweepers in the expansion. Discarding any number of Fire Energy from your Pokémon to deal 90 damage per Energy creates a game-ending threat once ramp engines or mid-game acceleration are online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fire decks are gaining traction again thanks to several new support options, and Charizard’s scaling damage allows it to remove even tanky ex Pokemon in a single strike. With the colourful pink and green background art by takuyoa, this can easily be one of the most-eyecatching cards in the set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultra Rare or not, the card’s destructive potential certainly commands a premium.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Dawn – 129/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230498"><div id="230498" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dawn - 129/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a competitive standpoint, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8AYy?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn</a> is one of the best evolution-focused Supporters printed in recent sets, and her Special Illustration Rare is the best-looking way to add her to your deck. Fetching a Basic, a Stage 1, and a Stage 2 Pokémon all at once massively accelerates setup. Decks relying on multi-stage combos or heavy evolutions, particularly Megas, benefit enormously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, Dawn cuts down the number of turns required to assemble full lines, dramatically improving consistency. Supporters with this level of deck-building impact rarely stay cheap for long.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mega Charizard X ex – 130/094 (Mega Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230497"><div id="230497" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 130/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Identical in function to the other Charizard prints, the Mega Hyper Rare version retains the same brutally efficient Inferno X attack, but in a breathtaking golden presentation. The combination of universal Fire Energy support, high base HP, and late-game nuking potential makes <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgD5?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> a central threat in Fire archetypes — but now, this card also looks like it belongs on a first place medal as well as a binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that competitive players already expect the card to headline at least one top-tier deck, its market price reflects both power and scarcity.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mega Charizard X ex – 125/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230496"><div id="230496" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 125/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting comfortably at the top of Phantasmal Flames is the Special Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADnZq?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a>, and with good reason. In competitive terms, it shares the same terrifying damage ceiling as the other Charizard prints thanks to Inferno X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the visual presentation by takuyoa that takes this top-tier card further. The artwork depicts Mega Charizard X in a dramatic, full-scene composition: blue flames striking all-over, wings outstretched, and a mesmerising display of Charmander, Charmeleon, and base Charizard underneath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a rare example of a Charizard card that captures both the ferocity and scale of the Mega form without overcrowding the frame. Combined with its very limited pull rate, this treatment has made it the definitive chase card of the set, a blend of raw competitive power and high-end collector appeal that few other cards can match.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 17, 2025 4:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">As for Colossal Order, the studio will deliver a few more updates before Iceflake fully takes over. Those will include a major update that will add bikes, Old Town buildings, and other improvements. A beta version of the game's editor with mod-asset support will also arrive before the end of the year. Iceflake will then take over the franchise at the start of 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">In the forum post, Colossal Order Mariina Hallikainen said the studio never could have imagined Cities: Skylines would become a franchise played by millions.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're confident the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership," Hallikainen said. "As we move forward, we're excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision."</p><p dir="ltr">Iceflake will be sharing its own plans for Cities: Skylines 2 development in the coming weeks, and is working with Colossal Order to ensure a smooth transition, according to the forum post. Iceflake Studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said taking over the franchise is "an immense honor and a great responsibility," while noting the developer has a long history of making city-building games, like 2021's post-apocalyptic city-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/684450/Surviving_the_Aftermath/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Surviving the Aftermath</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game," Liljedahl said.</p><p dir="ltr">The forum post doesn't state a specific reason for why Colossal Order and Paradox are going their separate ways, but the launch of Cities: Skylines 2 wasn't exactly smooth. Prior to launch in October 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paradox-interactive-warns-of-cities-skyline-2-performance-issues-ahead-of-launch/1100-6518493/" data-ref-id="1100-6518493">Paradox warned players about the game's performance issues</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">After release, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-developers-provide-update-on-performance-issues-and-post-release-plans/1100-6518701/" data-ref-id="1100-6518701">acknowledged various performance problems</a> and stated its goal was to continue optimizing the title so that it could run at a stable 30 frames per second. In response to the game's rough launch, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-acknowledges-games-rough-state-and-rushed-dlc-making-big-changes/1100-6522761/" data-ref-id="1100-6522761">Beach Properties DLC was made free</a>, with additional content added to the game's Ultimate Edition. Cities: Skylines 2 currently sports a "Mixed" user review rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, while the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cities: Skylines</a> has "Very Positive" reviews.</p>

"After Krafton’s finance department, in May 2025, forecast a base-case earnout of $191 million, Krafton needed a way to 'cancel the earn-out.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-says-ai-generated-placeholder-artwork-slipped-into-anno-117-pax-romana" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft says AI-generated placeholder artwork 'slipped' into Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton is accused of initially attempting to persuade Unknown Worlds' founders to delay </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> based on "now-abandoned claims" the title was not ready for release.

It also states that Kim asked ChatGPT for advice on how to avoid paying the earnout. The generative AI tool reportedly told Kim it would be "difficult to cancel" the payout.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Not only was Krafton’s bottom line at stake; the earnout was a threat to Kim's job. Krafton thus took action to neutralize the threat of paying the earnout," continues the pre-brief.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that realisation sunk in, Krafton and Kim are accused of terminating the plaintiffs by falsely accusing them of attempting to proceed with the "premature" release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The pre-brief, however, states that during the discovery phase of the legal battle, Krafton CFO and corporate designee Yoon "could not name a single Krafton employee who actually thought the game was unready for release."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-owned-crystal-dynamics-confirms-another-round-of-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics confirms another round of layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The plaintiffs also note that, following an internal milestone review on May 27, 2025, Krafton creative director Hyeon-gyu Park agreed that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should launch into early access in August 2025 as previously planned.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, we got the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/new-planet-hopping-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-shows" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58d35eab-b2e4-4e79-a241-2819c736ec51" data-entity-substitution="canonical">first proper trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, but it seems Nintendo had more movie teasers ready to go for this week. Today, shared on the <a href="https://nintendo.today/s/aQWvIocH">Nintendo Today App</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434768853606880?s=20">on social media</a>, we got our first glimpse at the live-action adaptation of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, which just started filming in New Zealand. You can take a look at Link and Zelda below.</p>



<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="42052ba5-e7ce-4d85-b3bf-cf6d01a42b2b" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>The images show Link, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/nintendo-reveals-link-and-zelda-actors-for-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a92df43d-dc74-44ad-b28d-715b1074e8b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical">played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, and Zelda, played by Bo Bragason</a>, in a sprawling green countryside, presumably somewhere in Hyrule. On social media, the images are accompanied by a message from Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. We know this because he starts the message by saying, "This is Miyamoto." The full statement is as follows.</p><p>This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link. Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.</p><p>We know very little about the movie outside its two main cast members, but this image provides some morsels of context to speculate about. Both Link and Zelda's designs seem to be partially inspired by their most recent iterations on Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which is unsurprising, given the success of each of those games. Zelda, for example, is wearing blue, which is unlike her typical pink/purple and white attire found in prior games. Link is wearing his traditional green, which is unlike the newer games and is specifically evocative of his Twilight Princess look. Still, his cap-less appearance certainly evokes his newer design. Besides, Link <em>can </em>wear green in the newer games; his iconic Champion's Tunic dominates much of the promotional material, but his attire is more variable than Zelda's.</p><p>More notably, Link doesn't appear to have a weapon in these images, which raises many questions about his relationship to Zelda in this scene. He's typically tasked with defending or rescuing her, but when she has a weapon and he has nothing, that dynamic doesn't seem feasible here. Could she be a mentor figure in this scene? Or could this be a version of Link that has to learn to be brave across the course of the film? At this time, it's all unclear, but we're eager to learn more as we approach the game's May 2027 release date.</p><p>For more Nintendo news, you can check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/everything-we-learned-in-nintendos-direct-for-the-super-mario-galaxy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6151d643-41cb-4b79-a1df-e0070f202633" data-entity-substitution="canonical">a recap of everything from last week's Mario Galaxy Movie Direct right here</a>, or read our review of the latest Zelda spin-off, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/reverent-but-redundant" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="104533c3-31d3-4973-bc53-ce44f2cc4210" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/17/nintendo-shares-first-images-from-the-set-of-the-live-action-zelda-movie]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I, like probably many folks, only know about Charles Guiteau’s assassination of short-term president James Garfield from Stephen Sondheim’s musical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAnHW2qwc2Y&amp;list=RDLAnHW2qwc2Y&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Assassins</u></em></a>. So I was a little baffled when I saw the trailer for Netflix’s <em>Death by Lightning</em>, a four-episode series about the largely forgotten moment in history. But this question of memory is one of the things the show grapples with, and it ends up turning my first thought of “why would you make a show about this?” into something modern and affecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think <em>Death by Lightning</em> would work with a lesser cast. <em>Succession</em>’s Matthew Macfadyen as Guiteau is such a good choice–if anyone should play a minor historical figure with delusions of grandeur, it’s the guy who played Tom Wambsgans. Nick Offerman is very fun as vice president Chester A. Arthur, which is not a thing I’ve ever said about Chester A. Arthur. Michael Shannon brings a lot of depth to Garfield, though it always remains a little unfortunate that the show chooses to focus on him so much, when despite being the pillar around which all these interesting characters spin, he’s often the least interesting character in the room.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jopqrSojQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Death by Lightning | Official Trailer | Netflix"></iframe></figure><p>After giving a stirring speech in support of another candidate at the 1880 Republican National Convention, Garfield is elected the party’s presidential candidate. He’s surrounded by corrupt, self-serving blowhards, and over the course of his campaign he becomes convinced that maybe he can undo the political machine. In this way he’s very similar to Guiteau, a grifter who at least professes to have noble intentions, and who never quite seems to believe he’s grifting even as he lies and steals and confabulates. After a brief encounter on the campaign trail, Guiteau comes to believe he’s destined for a powerful position in Garfeild’s administration, and he spends the rest of the series trying to get what he feels he deserves.</p><p><em>Death by Lightning</em> walks a skillful line where there’s never any of the unbearable secondhand cringe of shows like <em>The Office</em> in watching Guiteau put himself out there. Guiteau often comes off as completely earnest and legitimate, which helps him con and win over those around him. He’s enthusiastic about and interested in people, and he’s both a very good con man and a terrible one, often failing to think through crucial bits of his cover stories because he seems to believe his own lies too much. He’s good at getting himself into the right place at the right time, but despite making real relationship in-roads with Arthur and others, he can never quite cross the line into becoming an actual insider. It’s hard not to root for him when Macfadyen plays him so compellingly, but it’s also impossible to root for him when he is so obviously wrong about what he thinks is happening. He is, in some ways, a parallel of Garfield’s quest to end political corruption–he believes that anyone should have a shot at greatness, and that people should do what they say they’re going to do–but he also completely embodies that corruption in his willingness to say and do anything to get close to power.</p><p>After completely undoing himself in an audience with Garfield–Guiteau’s artifice falls away, and he begs the president to “help me succeed like you did… Tell me how I can be great too” in a moment that is wonderfully intimate and also completely blowing it–and after finally being told in no uncertain terms he has no hope of a position in Garfield’s administration, Guiteau turns from being a booster for the president to seeing him as a corrupt liar Guiteau alone is charged with stamping out. Given that this turn is probably the only reason you’ve ever heard Guiteau’s name, it’s a bit unfortunate that most of this arc is crammed into the show’s final episode, which also has to cover the shooting, Garfield’s <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/james-garfield-assassination-us-president?ref=aftermath.site"><u>slow death from infection</u></a>, and Guiteau’s trial. Too much of <em>Death by Lightning</em>’s final hour is taken up by a focus on Garfield that felt unnecessary and not terribly interesting compared to the big questions Guiteau’s character raises, even as it’s moving to see those close to him struggle with his death. The show clearly wants to highlight the similarities between Garfield and Guiteau’s stories and the things they’ve done to earn their non-places in history, but the focus on Garfield as the lens through which to do it leaves a lot of good stuff on the table.</p><p>I was meant to see a 2001 <em>Assassins</em> revival that was <a href="https://variety.com/2003/legit/news/b-way-gunning-for-assassins-1117893021/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ultimately delayed to 2004</u></a> after 9/11 made its subject matter feel inappropriate; living in New York as Bush used my city as a pretense for war felt like the perfect time for the show to me, even though I understood the argument against it. <em>Death by Lightning</em> could be held to a similar “really, <em>now?</em>” criticism,&nbsp; though rather than raising issues about our <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Attempted_assassinations_of_Donald_Trump,_2024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>current president</u></a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired/"><u>Charlie Kirk</u></a>, its subject matter felt closest to some of the rhetoric of January 6. What are the consequences of the intimacy between a political leader and their adherents, whether that intimacy is a true belief or just campaign trail smoke? What does the government owe its people compared to what they perceive they’re owed, and what should people do when they feel failed? What happens to historical moments when history itself gets its claws in them–the meaning of January 6 is being constantly rewritten, its participants by turn traitors and heroes, but which story will win out in the arc of history? Will any of these people be remembered and, if so, for what? <em>Death by Lightning</em>’s Guiteau feels like a precursor to those who stormed the Capitol in 2021, deluded and disenfranchised, seeing in the anti-Garfield rhetoric around him a chance to air his own personal grievances and try–and fail–to make them about something bigger than himself.</p><p>In the end, <em>Death by Lightning</em> feels like it shines a light on the temporary nature of history, how the things that matter so much to us as we live through them will be seen differently by those who come after, if they even think of us at all. It reminds the viewer that no moment in history is <em>the most important</em> moment in history, even if it feels that way to its participants. While it works against itself a bit in the way it handles Garfield, it’s a welcome reminder that history is still happening and that our roles in it are still being written.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After working together for fifteen years, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have decided to part ways, with Colossal Order moving on to pursue its own projects and leaving the Cities Skylines franchise behind. Moving forward, Finland-based Iceflake Studios under Paradox Interactive will take the lead on the series.</p>



<p>The news was announced <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">with a lengthy post on the Paradox Interactive forums</a>, and claims that the decision to split "<em>was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams - ensuring the strongest possible future for the Cities: Skylines franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Development of the Cities: Skylines franchise will move to a different studio under Paradox Interactive's leadership and Colossal Order looks forward to building on its experience across new projects and exploring new creative opportunities. Both companies are excited for what the future holds while remaining deeply appreciative of our shared history and grateful to the Cities' community</em>."</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cities-skylines-ii-simcity-curse/">Cities Skylines 2 launched in 2023</a>, it did so in a less-than-ideal state, with a glaring lack of content and a slew of performance issues hampering any excitement for fans around the game. Colossal Order immediately began working on fixing the game's issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/cities-skylines-ii-focus-on-performance-bugs-over-dlc-consoles-roadmap/">and put out a roadmap for the fixes to come</a>, though even after two years on store shelves, it still sits at a 'Mixed' rating on Steam for both recent and overall player reviews.</p>



<p>It is definitely the end of an era for Colossal Order to be moving on entirely from the franchise. Though after what can be generously described as an abysmal launch for Cities Skylines 2, it seems that both Paradox and Colossal Order were ready to let another team take a crack at the series.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together</em>," said Mattias Lilja, deputy chief executive officer at Paradox Interactive.</p>



<p>"<em>We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>The transition isn't happening immediately; Colossal Order is still working on the game for the balance of 2025, with a few more updates to implement. In 2026, Iceflake Studios will take over properly, with Colossal Order working alongside them to ensure a smooth transition. Iceflake will also be responsible for completing the console version of the game. There's still no update on when that'll be ready, nor does Paradox say it will be delayed further due to this change in developers.</p>



<p>"<em>Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility</em>," said Lasse Liljedahl, studio manager at Iceflake Studios. "<em>There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-17</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-7-brings-brand-new-difficulty-mode-a-life-improvements-and-more.1355788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7, also known as "Expedition", and it's bringing a brand new difficulty mode with it, as well as further fixes and improvements for the A-Life system and much more.</p>

<p>The new Master difficulty mode is, as you'd probably expect, not for the faint of heart; GSC Game World describes it as a mode for "the most skilled players", and it brings "harsher conditions and limited saves", according to the developer.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's a brand new Expedition mode modifier that will introduce those conditions to any difficulty level, so if you feel like challenging yourself but don't want to commit to a Master run, the Expedition mode should allow you to do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.7-expedition.jpg?itok=rM7oOjg2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.7-expedition.jpg?itok=h5Owmbbt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>'s latest update is red meat for the difficulty hounds.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not up for trying out Master or Expedition, don't worry; there are a host of other improvements and changes that have been introduced in this update, including further fixes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">A-Life system</a>, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-15-a-life-new-threats" rel="nofollow">changed considerably</a> since the game's launch last year.</p>

<p>New features for A-Life include the ability for factions to expand their territories, which means that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s landscape is constantly shifting in terms of who's in charge of where. Factions will also defend their lands from hostile encroachment.</p>

<p>Additionally, it should now be a little easier to fight in a swamp; GSC Game World says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>enemies will "have real problems detecting you in tall grass or reeds", and that their shots will be less accurate when they're shooting at you in these conditions as well.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see everything that's new as part of this update, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>




<p>This isn't the first time GSC Game World has found itself in the news over the last few days; the developer recently issued a DMCA claim to survival game&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, although it looks like the issues raised therein have been ironed out now, since&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return" rel="nofollow">returned to Steam last week</a>.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also landing on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10014084" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> this week.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-update-brings-wave-based-battle-mode-and-more-tomorrow.1355785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced a major&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>update that's arriving tomorrow, and it's bringing a wave-based battle mode and a host of gameplay improvements with it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/17/new-lost-soul-aside-update-out-tomorrow-includes-wave-based-surge-of-voidrax-mode/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the new Surge of Voidrax mode pits you against 100 waves of enemies back-to-back. All of the main game's skills and weapons will be unlocked from the beginning in this mode.</p>

<p>Waves will consist of "classic bosses and diverse monsters", according to Ultizero Games, and you'll be able to refill your supplies and boost your power between each wave, thus helping you to prepare for what's to come.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=_c91wmg6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=D3CEkgXg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is getting a big free update tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearing waves will grant you access to unique cosmetic rewards, and you'll get them upon clearing "specific waves for the first time", so you won't have to beat the entire mode to check out the new looks.</p>

<p>It's not just the Surge of Voidrax mode coming in this update, either. There are also a range of gameplay improvements and tweaks coming to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>tomorrow, the first of which allows you to skip the game's prologue and jump straight into combat if you wish.</p>

<p>A new Voidrax Pathfinder system has been added to help you with "complex puzzles or challenges", too, so if you're stuck on some part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, this sounds like it'll be for you. Let's hope <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>situation</a>, though.</p>

<p>You can also expect a range of new skins, "completely revamped" cutscenes with new animations and improved effects, and refined combat actions, as well as customizable controls. In short, tomorrow's update should hopefully give you a reason to jump back into&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>or to check it out for the first time.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its major Surge of Voidrax update launches for both platforms tomorrow.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the game's official forum, Paradox says the decision for itself and Colossal Order to split was a mutual one, and that said decision was made "thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams" in order to ensure "the strongest possible future" for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines</em>.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a beta version of asset support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-editor-weekly-patches" rel="nofollow">the game's Editor</a> "before year-end", but after that, development will switch to Iceflake, who will take over starting from the beginning of next year.</p>

<p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>was released in late October 2023, and it's fair to say the game wasn't exactly received well at launch (by its community, at the very least), with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-will-support-mods-on-consoles-devs-promise-performance-improvements" rel="nofollow">complaining</a> about poor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-of-several-patches-to-improve-performance-following-flawed" rel="nofollow">performance</a>.</p>

<p>Colossal Order and Paradox subsequently implemented a number of updates aimed at addressing common performance woes, but whether they've been successful is a matter of opinion; the game is still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam at time of writing.</p>




<p>That's without mentioning&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s long-in-development console versions, which have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-versions-not-before-summer" rel="nofollow">times</a>&nbsp;and which still don't have anything approaching a release date yet.</p>

<p>Perhaps Iceflake Studios will be able to fix the common issues that still appear to plague&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, but we won't be finding out until next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re right in the thick of the holiday season. City streets are hanging up their festive, winter lights and folks have begun shopping for gifts for all their family, friends, and loved ones. Traditionally, Black Friday weekend and the following Cyber Monday tend to be a great time to save some cash on some new pieces of tech. However, Amazon has already pushed live a handful of Black Friday-level deals ahead of schedule so you don’t have to wait to save.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/"> Right now, you can grab the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth headphones on sale for 31% off. They usually sell for $429, but the discount brings them down to as low as just $298</a>. You can end up saving $131 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Listening Experience</h2>
<p>The Ultra version of the Bose QuietComfort headphones has a handful of advantages over the standard model. These utilize Bluetooth 5.3 as opposed to 5.1, granting a longer range, maintaining connection within up to 30 feet of your device. You can expect superior sound quality thanks to the Snapdragon processors. Bose calls out the regular QuietComfort headphones as having “durable, all-day comfort,” with the Ultra has “luxurious comfort,” which is an inherently silly distinction. This though is referring to the additional padding on the ear cups and across the headband.</p>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra headphones also introduce Immersion Mode. This is Bose’s spatialized audio designed to make it feel like the audio is coming from outside of the headphones, leading to more lifelike sound.</p>
<p>This mode comes in addition to the Quiet Mode and Aware Mode.</p>



<p>Quiet Mode is Bose’s audio with active noise cancellation turned on. This does what it sounds like it does, cancelling out unwanted, distracting noises from your environment so you can focus on what you want to hear and nothing else. This is great for when on a plane with the turbine going crazy or when just in a busy, chatty office setting.</p>
<p>Aware Mode keeps you aware of the sounds from your surroundings, allowing those noises to filter through with your music, podcast, or audiobook. This is recommended for situations like when navigating the walkways of busy city streets where it’s good to hear oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>Both models are capable of up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. You get up to 18 hours when using Immersive Audio mode. They recharge pretty quickly. Only 15 minutes of being plugged in will bring you up to two and a half hours of listening time (two hours of Immersive Audio).</p>

<p>It turns out that while Capcom was working on its litany of scares for Resi 8, the developer was already working on Resident Evil Requiem, and it will be an inclusive entry.</p>



<p>The Ethan Winters journey is over in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-2026-showcase-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. We move on, and Grace Ashcroft heads up the mantle this time around. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Leon Kennedy</a> continue to swirl, Capcom has clearly had Grace’s chapter in mind for some time.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-over-6-years-in-the-making">Resident Evil Requiem Is Over 6 Years In The Making</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hands up (or out) if you’re excited. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve learned a lot about <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Start</a>‘s interview with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa. One of the big takeaways is how long Capcom has worked on Resident Evil Requiem, and how its development coincided with Village’s creation.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Looking back, I understand how&nbsp;Resident Evil 4&nbsp;and Village became more action-heavy. Yes, that we have to admit. Looking back at the feedback, we understand how fans prefer more horror. Requiem was in development way before Village. We just wanted to make sure in this game, we wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part.&nbsp;I am not sure if all development teams are doing this, but I personally try to read as much or all the comments on social media.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumazawa also elaborated further on Requiem’s journey: “So looking back on the online multiplayer game, <strong>it’s been in development for around six years or so.</strong>“</p>







<p>Despite the franchise being around for over 30 years, Capcom is still looking to attract new players. Kumazawa explained how Resident Evil Requiem’s development is looking to make it an accessible title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I guess the one thing I want to let people know is that because Resident Evil is a long-running series, I want people to know they can still play Requiem and enjoy it. There are no prerequisites for the game or prior knowledge required. If this is a new game for them or their entry into the series, I want them also to enjoy this, and that any player can play thanks to difficulties like Casual. Please don’t think there are entry barriers to this game. But by saying that, I am not ignoring series fans. There are elements I have put in this that are very familiar, in the demo you can see leads and links that series fans will enjoy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, whether you’re an old-school player or a newcomer, it will be inclusive for everyone. If you are a veteran, let us know your favorite game, boss, and your personal ‘hide-behind-the-couch moment’ from over the years through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

Below, we look back at how the game shifted the nature of Sonic games with new gimmicks.</em></p><p>Sonic Colors marked a significant turning point in Sonic the Hedgehog's gaming career. Four years prior, the franchise had hit a horrifying low with Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Two years after that, Sonic began a slow and shaky climb from rock bottom with 2008's Sonic Unleashed. And in 2010, Sonic Colors finally brought the blue hedgehog back into gamers' good graces, becoming the best-received 3D title since the Adventure games of the late '90s and early 2000s. Things were finally starting to look bright again for the franchise--but with the good came the bad as well.</p><p>Up to that point, 3D Sonic games had learned more heavily into their narratives, with the Sonic Adventure duology and Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 standing out as significant examples. For Colors, the plot was scaled back considerably, harkening back to the simpler stories of Sonic's classic games. In fact, like most of the classics, Colors foregoes an opening cinematic completely. Once the player moves beyond the title screen, they're immediately dropped into the first level. Only then does the story begin to take shape: Sonic and Tails have made a trip to space to investigate Eggman's Interstellar Amusement Park, a creation of the mad doctor designed as penance for his evil misdeeds in the past.</p><p>Naturally, the duo isn't buying Eggman's change of heart for a second. Their suspicions are confirmed as they almost immediately discover that the park is a front for a sinister alien-enslavement operation, in which Eggman plans to use their energy to power a giant mind-control device and--you guessed it--conquer the world. Now, it's up to Sonic to race across the six captive planets that make up Eggman's twisted amusement park and free their inhabitants from his grasp. It's a plot ripped straight out of a goofy Saturday-morning cartoon, and a refreshing change after years of the franchise's hit-and-miss attempts at deeper and more complex stories.</p><div

content!</p></div><p>With the more lighthearted story came a greater focus on comedy. To facilitate this, Sega brought on US-based writers Ken Pontac and Warren Graff of Happy Tree Friends fame to write the game's dialogue. The characters' personalities remained intact, albeit with a much snarkier edge than they typically displayed. This is perhaps best exemplified in Eggman's PA announcements. In every level, messages from Eggman play at regular intervals over the park's PA system. These range from warnings not to lick the rides at Sweet Mountain to the importance of holding your breath while in Asteroid Coaster's harsh vacuum of space.</p><p>What made these lines work comedically was their brevity. Actual conversations between characters, however, were a different story. Many jokes and gags were laboriously drawn out to the point that they stopped being funny. Sonic is no stranger to cracking off amusing one-liners, but much of the dialogue in Colors is akin to a frat boy at a party telling a joke that doesn't land, then trying to explain to his unamused audience why they should be laughing. If you've ever heard the insipid phrase "Baldy McNosehair" in gaming circles and were unsure where it originated, well … here you go. Pontac and Graff (who, as a side note, had virtually no prior knowledge of the Sonic franchise when writing for Colors) would continue to write for subsequent titles up through 2017's Sonic Forces, contributing to a strong tonal shift for the series that would define that decade of Sonic games.</p><p>For the first time in a 3D Sonic game, the focus was put solely on traditional high-speed Sonic gameplay--a move greatly appreciated by fans weary of the series' insistence on alternate gameplay styles. The boost mechanic returned after its successful debut in Sonic Unleashed, allowing Sonic to attain blisteringly high speeds with a simple push of a button. Of course, with the original Sonic Colors being exclusive to Nintendo Wii, a console with far lower processing power than its contemporaries, it wasn't nearly as flashy or exhilarating as its predecessor was on PS3 or Xbox 360, but it was serviceable enough. Colors also brought back Unleashed's occasional switch from 3D to 2D gameplay and allowed platforming to take center stage. Unfortunately, much of said platforming was clunky and methodical, lacking the flow and speed that made older side-scrolling Sonic games unique and fun.</p><p>What <em>was</em> unique and fun was the introduction of the aforementioned wisps: small alien creatures made of pure energy that augmented Sonic's speed-based abilities. After absorbing their powers, Sonic could transform into a cyan laser that zips along pathways, an orange rocket that shoots upward destroying everything in its path, a yellow drill that tears through the ground, or even a blue cube that … well, turns things into cubes to hop onto (not all of them were winners). Most of these powers felt like natural extensions of Sonic's typical gameplay as opposed to the drastically different alternate gameplay styles of past games.</p><p>At the time, fans and critics alike lauded Sonic Colors, and in some respects, deservedly so. It was a refreshing, back-to-basics approach that Sonic desperately needed after years of bizarre experimentation with team-based gameplay, guns, out-of-place human romances, werehogs, and the like. On the other hand, it was also a significant dilution of the Sonic formula that would unfortunately become a defining characteristic of the franchise throughout the 2010s. It was both a return to form and a troubling portent of things to come. Thankfully, recent games like Sonic Frontiers have sent the pendulum swinging back in the other direction, bringing onboard longtime Sonic scribe Ian Flynn and once again fleshing out the gameplay and story elements. We're currently in a promising new era for Sonic, but there's no telling if we would have gotten here without the huge shakeup--for better or worse--that Sonic Colors brought to the franchise 15 years ago.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been out for a few days, and has enjoyed its first weekend released into the hands of eager players. However, current concurrent player counts have many fans asking: Is Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 underperforming?</p>
<p>This question stems from one source in particular, the SteamDB listing for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3606480/charts/">The game is ranked 6th in global top sellers</a>, which should reassure some fans. However, the game has only just reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/#1w">a peak concurrent player count above 100,000</a>.</p>
<p>This sounds impressive - it is a huge amount of people to be playing a game at once on one platform - but comparing Black Ops 7 to previous releases paints an altogether different picture. Back in 2024 when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> came out, the game saw a peak of around 315,000 on Steam. Earlier still, in 2022 when Modern Warfare III released, the game saw a Steam peak of roughly 491,000.</p>

<p>There's been a clear drop in players, then. This returns us to the question: Is Black Ops 7 underperforming? While specific figures on other platforms aren't nearly as public than Steam, we can see a different story elsewhere. We can't sort games on storefronts by concurrents, but we can by recent sales (for the most part). For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the second top selling game on the PlayStation Store as of writing. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/all-games/console?xr=shellnav">The Xbox store</a> ranks Black Ops 7 at the top of "Most relevant", which indicates some degree of high interest from Xbox owners.</p><p>It's also worth noting other PC storefronts <em>do</em> exist, even if Steam is the most popular of them. Call of Duty has been available on the Battle.net launcher for a few years now, and there's the Microsoft games store too - though, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/top-paid/games/xbox">this store ranks Black Ops 7 15th in its Top Paid category</a>.</p>
<p>The game is also available on console and PC Game Pass, which may very well impact where it lands in terms of direct sales. Modern Warfare 3, which was previously highlighted as a peak for recent Call of Duty releases on Steam, did not launch day one on Game Pass. Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7 did, which could very well have impacted these figures.
</p>
<p>The truth is obviously unclear as of right now, and we can only judge by Steam figures. However, Steam <em>is</em> the biggest PC platform, and it's not like Steam users are aliens with totally different wants than the console player base. With Black Ops 7 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">the lowest metacritic score for a Call of Duty game ever</a>, and other big hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players#:~:text=Lotsa%20looters.&amp;text=Arc%20Raiders%20has%20blown%20past,peak%20by%20roughly%2030%2C000%20players.">Arc Raiders</a> popping up close to its release date, maybe Call of Duty has been jumped a bit this year.</p>

            <p>Last week saw Valve reveal three pieces of hardware. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">The Steam Machine</a>, a console-like mini PC you plug into your TV. A newly updated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, which combines the original's trackpad-style thumbpads with the double thumbsticks of a regular gamepad. And also the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, a new virtual reality headset that streams games from your PC and opens up your whole game library to be played in the privacy of your own goggles.</p>
<p>While I have a default thrill setting that engages whenever Valve announces new hardware, it's been interesting to see the variety of responses to the hardware reveals. I was surprised, in particular, by the muted response to the Steam Machine in our comments.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In large part, the criticism is aimed at its graphics chip and how effective it will be at competing with the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The Steam Machine's GPU is a customised chip using AMD's RDNA 3 architecture. First released nearly three years ago (and surpassed by February's RDNA 4 graphic cards), the chip's main weakness, when compared to the current crop of consoles, is its limited VRAM. The Steam Machine can only muster up 8GBs compared to the 10GB in the Xbox Series X and the 10 to 12GB in the PS5. (Sony's console dynamically allocates RAM from a pool of 16GB, hence the range.)</p>
<p>VRAM is the memory dedicated to storing graphical information when playing games. As a rule of thumb, when playing modern games that lean on this dedicated memory to store texture and shader data, the more of it you have the greater the smoother your play experience. The less space available, the more likely you will run into stuttering as the graphical data is loaded in. The worry, then, for the Steam Machine, is that when playing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, is they you'll run into a choppier game than those playing the same game on consoles unless you lower the texture settings.</p>

<p>Larian Studio's Publishing Director Michael Douse took to Twitter to argue Valve aren't looking to make a device that exceeds the power of the consoles, they're making a baseline. "They're probably betting on the fact that anyone who wants more demanding PC hardware on their TV is part of the audience who know how to turn any PC into a Steam Machine," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1989082317084926018">Douse argues</a>.</p><p>If Valve went high spec, high price, the Steam Machine wouldn't be accessible to anyone looking to dip their toe into an uncomplicated world of PC gaming. Nor would it likely win over the crowd currently demanding a powerful computer, as they will be able to make their own living room PC – and potentially for less than Valve can sell it.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1989085967781912751">Douse says</a>, Valve are setting a baseline. "If Valve can once again normalise and thus create that entry point there is potential for big growth in that new market". Once Gabe and his kin establish a baseline, other companies, such as ASUS and Lenovo, can roll in with their more powerful machines.</p>

<p>Anyway, we tend to shy away from 'Person says thing online' style stories, so in the classic bait and switch, I can now finally talk about what I want to, having justified it by grabbing onto the credible, authoritative coat tails of the lovely Michael Douse.</p><p>I've found the response to Valve's hardware reveals fascinating because it's shown the different ways PC games fit into peoples' lives. There is much more choice than even five years ago and you can now pick and choose pieces of hardware that enable our hobby to live in completely different places.</p>
<p>Take me, for instance, when I read James' pieces about Valve's upcoming hardware, I was mentally slotting it into different orders of want based not on specifications, but how the devices would enable new ways to play games.</p>
<p>Until I got this job, back when I was still in the world of freelance, I was perfectly happy to keep my gaming confined to the desktop PC in the living room. I live in a one bedroom flat and my partner works from the office, so when I needed to review a game it was okay to take up the living room with the noise of whatever management sim or shooter I was playing. When they came home, I'd carry on with noise cancelling headphones. Less ideal, but still okay.</p>
<p>Since I've started at RPS, I'm both out and about more and needing to play more games in the evening. Suddenly a Steam Deck is much more appealing. Before, dropping £350 on even the cheapest LCD model would be a waste of money. Why would I ever use the handheld when the desktop was right there. Now, it means I can keep playing when I'm in the office, or travelling to and from events.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then, in January, I'm moving to a flat that has a separate space to set up my desktop, so I'll no longer be dominating the living room. Which has also made the Steam Machine a much more appealing buy. I'm not personally fussed about smudgy textures as my desktop is there if I need high fidelity, but I do like the ability to play games on the big television screen. Still, I'll likely get the much cheaper option of a Steam Deck dock before buying a whole separate machine. Though, if I enjoy the docked life and find the new Steam Controller makes playing classically-PC games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> on the television more approachable then I may work up to the little Gabecube in time.</p><p>As for the Frame, while I've played and liked VR games, I've very large glasses and find the headsets generally uncomfortable. It's not for me, currently. But, I know for others the order of their interest in Valve's hardware will be radically different to mine.</p>
<p>When I asked around the Treehouse, young Callum said that the Steam Deck has been an introduction to PC gaming for a lot of his friends. They'd been put off by the research involved in buying a PC and the handheld made it easy. They've since been casting their games to TV and are exactly the sort of people who can see a Steam Machine being the next step. Especially if it allows couch co-op with a Bluetooth connection that supports four separate controllers.</p>
<p>I'm really keen to hear more about how Valve's upcoming hardware will (or won't) fit into your lives, as I'm enjoying the change of conversation away from what components your PC needs and this move towards what form factor fits you best.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> developers Colossal Order are moving on from the city building series and parting ways with publishers Paradox Interactive, after 15 years of collaboration. They're handing Skylines over to one of Paradox's in-house teams, Surviving The Aftermath developers Iceflake Studios, who will take over "all existing and future development for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>", spanning free updates and paid expansions.</p>
<p>Colossal Order will chip in a few final Cities: Skylines 2 updates before they depart for greener pastures. These include the addition of some bikes and Old Town buildings (coming 19th November), Creator packs and radios (December 3rd​), and a few "general improvements" or bug fixes. They're also putting together a beta for asset mods in the game's editor, to launch before the end of the year. Iceflake are grabbing the reins from the start of 2026. Presumably, they'll also be making Cities: Skylines 3, if such a project ever comes to pass.</p>
<p>All that's from <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">an announcement post</a> on the Paradox forums. There's also <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/studio-shift-frequently-asked-questions.1873693/">a FAQ</a> which offers a tiny bit more background. Colossal Order are departing to "work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities", while Iceflake - whom Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-have-bought-the-studio-behind-surviving-the-aftermath">bought in 2020</a> - bring "strong experience in simulation and city-building games" and have demonstrated "the creativity, technical expertise, and passion needed to take on the development of Cities: Skylines".​</p>
<p>We never final-reviewed Surviving The Aftermath, but Nate (RPS in Peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surviving-the-aftermath-of-the-early-access-city-builder-craze">wasn't blown away</a> by the early access build, commenting that "although the model they've put in place is plenty of fun, I couldn't in good conscience say there was anything strikingly unique about it - at least not yet."</p><p><span data-position="1"></span>
​
</p><p>In fairness, Cities: Skyline 2 fared even worse at launch in 2023. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">called it</a> "a standard-bearer that ought to have higher standards", concluding that the game "offers little that feels substantially new or improved enough to warrant a sequel". The game launched in a shonky state, with Paradox baldly confessing that they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">knew the performance was dodgy before launch</a>, but underestimated how much players would care.</p>
<p>RPS hardware boffin James found the performance to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">"considerably less terrible"</a> as of April 2024, but many patches later, Skylines 2 still has a mixed user review reception on Steam as of writing.</p>
<p>All in all, you might be disposed to read Paradox's promise that Cities: Skylines 2 will retain the same "core identity" after Iceflake takes over as a negative. "While every studio brings its own development style, our shared goal is to continue evolving the game in a way that stays true to its foundation," the FAQ goes on.</p>
