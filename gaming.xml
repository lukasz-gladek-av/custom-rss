            <p>Cheese and loyal pets (two important items on Maslow's hierarchy of needs) have been added to the co-op survival crafting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a>. The dairy product manifests as various suspiciously coloured cheese wheels which you can cook and eat, while loyalty comes in the form of freakish pets that can now follow your every move. The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is. "There is, as far as we know, no limit to how many pets can follow you at once," say the devs. Hmmm. I wonder if any scientifically minded folks will test such a hypothesis. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>I say "headcrabs" in the headline because the game has a lot of Half-Life vibes. But really the pets are <a href="https://abioticfactor.wiki.gg/wiki/Pest">these creepy hedgehog critters</a> normally considered pests. You can tame them and enjoy them as companions for as long as they survive the hostile lab environment. The pets have "very small, adventurous brains," we are told. </p><p> A bunch of other small things have been added or altered, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472349895596">the recent update from developers Deep Field Games</a>, including some useful walkie talkies.

<p>These walkie talkies will let players chat over greater distances, whereas before in-game chittering was limited to proximity chat. Not a huge change for anyone simply opting for Discord. But in co-op chaos like this it's often more fun to opt-in to the built-in communication of the game world. "For now, Walkie-Talkies will allow players to hear you all over the Facility -- and even beyond," say the creators. "Later on we have some more plans with these cool little communicators, and we may impose a few more sensible restrictions." Sounds ominous.</p>
<p>Abiotic Factor is basically "Half-Life but funnier and with friends" - a co-op survive-em-up with poo jokes and the ability to make "weird soup" from inedible items. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-lifey-survival-game-abiotic-factor-is-out-now-in-early-access">in early access for the moment</a>, with staggered updates planned to bring jetpacks and new sectors of the lab to explore, all before the 1.0 version comes out sometime in winter. You can check the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4358998952353776588/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">full changelog for this update</a> but here are some highlights plucked out for you, because my hobby is reading patch notes freed from context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Fatigue gain from pie slices</li>
<li>Food decay can no longer be repaired at the Repair Bench</li>
<li>Fixed an issue were Trams would destroy furniture above or below them, violating several laws of physics</li>
<li>Fixed Antepasta turning soup toxic</li>
<li>CAUTION: Security Robots are no longer intimidated by the presence of a Crafting Bench when attempting to exit their pod</li>
<li>Potatoes can now be planted</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't played Abiotic Factor yet but I have been looking at various YouTube japes longingly. I'm writing this news post as a way to get myself psyched up to actually try it. It certainly looks like my cup of bubbling radioactive ooze. </p>

            <p>There aren't many ways left to put a twist on Stardew Valley, but suffixing it with "in space!" oughta do it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-known-galaxy/">Little-Known Galaxy</a> is out in a week, and currently has a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">Steam</a>, where you can sample many of the delights that you're used to from a Stardewlike when you're new in town: meeting the locals, growing potatoes, and tidying up the place. Also, raising alien pets, seeking out new life, and new civilisations... It all takes place on a spaceship, you see, and this has some ramifications to playing the game beyond reskinning everything to be shiny metal instead of picturesque mud. It's an intriguing proposition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There is a reskin, though, and it's surprising how refreshing it is to the formula. The town is arranged on different decks of the ship, making it much easier to navigate than I had feared, and there are a couple of sweet plant aliens and characterful little robots running around. The schoolteacher is a well groomed robot named Max. A lot of people go to the plaza deck at dinner time to hang out at the restaurant, and the ship has seen a lot of captains come and go, so several crewmembers are quite curmudgeonly toward you, the new trainee captain. Generally, though, this seems to be the utopian ideal of Starfleet, with everyone getting along and doing their assigned jobs. It's sort of like if Picard got really into gardening <em>before</em> he retired.</p>
<p>But the space thing does shake up how you play. One small but impactful change is that you can't just till a convenient square of dirt outside your front door. To grow crops you need to craft a planter, and they run on power - so you also need to craft solar panels and whack them on the outside of your ship. If you don't have enough solar panels, your new planters will be useless lumps of showy metal, making Little-Known Galaxy the first Cybertrunk Owner Simulator (*snare*). This changes the whole loop of your crafting cycle! You need to gather soil samples and scrap metal as a priority, rather than the basis of your economy early on being quick-growing plants to turn a fast profit. </p>
<p>And yes, you visit planet surfaces (you start in orbit around a grey planet with a mysterious monolith on it) and can travel to <em>other</em> planets, too. There's a lot more going on with Little-Known Galaxy than I had anticipated. Have a poke around <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">the demo</a> yourself, and watch out for full release on May 20th.</p>

Now, one mod team has gone ahead and built just that.</p><p>Prolific mod content creator Toasted tasked his mod team with creating a Star Wars Clone Wars mod pack for Helldivers 2, and has published the results in video form with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/SWBFUpdates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SWBFUpdates</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/StayBombastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@StayBombastic</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OzzyOVLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OzzyOVLD</a>.</p><p>The mod pack, built by modders Kboy and @irastris, swaps out Hellidvers for playable Clone Troopers from the 501st Legion, including Captain Rex, Commander Cody, and Sergeant Hunter, with Automaton enemies redesigned as Separatist Droids. There are B1-series battle droids, B2-series super battle droids, Droidekas, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Most of us know playing the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> with friends and family can be a great way to spend your free time. But what about turning to board games when you find yourself alone and looking for something to pass the time? It's not as strange as it may sound, because many board games these days are designed to be played solo, or at least have a fun solitaire mode. From <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy games</a> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">roll-and-write board games</a> and everything in between, there are many options available for solo play. Below, we'll take a look at some of the best board games that can be played alone, giving you a chance to relax and unwind while still engaging your mind.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Solo Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/x3bRY" target="_blank">Final Girl</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/qV657" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/wKvrN" target="_blank">Hadrian's Wall</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5qROV" target="_blank">Imperium: Horizons</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/RVgAV" target="_blank">Frosthaven</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/6wMEq" target="_blank">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/AMZKw" target="_blank">Mage Knight</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w2lqq" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mmDjN" target="_blank">Under Falling Skies</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/E34A2" target="_blank">Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPwYR" target="_blank">Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3qAxM" target="_blank">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lngrR" target="_blank">Cascadia</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kPNb5" target="_blank">Cartographers Heroes</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/YlPex" target="_blank">Terraforming Mars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KjPv3" target="_blank">Spirit Island</a></li></ul><h2>Final Girl</h2><div id="196835"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Final Girl" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/final-girl-1709150748483.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Final Girl</h3></p></div><p>If there’s a particular theme that excels for solo gaming, it’s horror. When it’s just you and the dice in a darkened room, board gaming gets the closest it can realistically manage to feeling unsettling. And whatever your particular fear is, one of Final Girl’s many, <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPgDJ" target="_blank">many expansion sets</a> will have you covered. It’s a modular game in which you play as the titular survivor at the end of a horror story, splitting time allocations between taking actions, playing cards and getting more cards, a split that gives the game its tension and strategic edge. But the core box isn’t enough to play on its own: you also need a <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPgDJ" target="_blank">Film Box</a>, which comes with two scenarios based on classic horror movies, so you can pick and choose between your favorite flicks and your worst fears. Whatever you choose, you’re guaranteed a thrill ride in this horribly unfair but narratively brilliant game.</p><h2>Dune: Imperium</h2><div id="155275"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Dune Imperium" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/19/dune-imperium-box-1634675346852.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p>Despite it being one of the best strategy games of recent years, you might be surprised to find Dune: Imperium on this list since really it needs three or four players to shine. However, the need to also cater for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a> led the designer to include an automated opponent, House Hagal. Despite this being a fairly interactive game, House Hagal is simple to administer yet still manages to block out board space, steal resources and send in troops to contest territory, just like a real player. Solitaire you face two of them, with varying difficulty levels, which feels a lot more satisfying than just playing for a high score, as well as letting you experience this excellent game without roping in your friends. Read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Hadrian’s Wall</h2><div id="196836"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Hadrian's Wall" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/hadrians-wall-1709150823933.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Hadrian's Wall</h3></p></div><p>Hadrian’s Wall is a flip-and-write, where cards are flipped off the top of a deck and then the players - here representing Roman generals - use the depicted resources as they see fit on their own individual player sheets. It’s always been a solo-friendly genre, but this game really excels when played solitaire, not least because there’s now a <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/content/File%20Storage%20for%20site/HadriansWall-SoloCampaign.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloadable campaign</a> for it. Your task is to construct walls and fortresses in Roman Britain to repel Pictish invasions at the end of each round. That sense of dynamism is one of the things that sets the game apart from its peers. The others are a satisfying array of crunchy combos to cross off on your sheet, for plenty of strategic depth, and a long-term commitment to resource management with actual tokens rather than box-checks. Between them, these three things push Hadrian’s Wall away from the abstract conventions of its genre and into the living, breathing realm of history.</p><h2>Imperium: Horizons</h2><div id="196837"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Imperium: Horizons" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/imperium-1709150914212.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Imperium: Horizons</h3></p></div><p>Civilization games have a long and storied history, but they’re not, on the whole, very solo-friendly. The Imperium series from Osprey games, of which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/imperium-horizons-board-game-review">Imperium: Horizons</a> is the latest and greatest entry, is a notable exception. It’s also a fascinating exercise in bringing the deck-building mechanic to the genre. Each player selects a civilization, which comes with a unique starting deck and set of cards they can add as the game progresses, and it’s this granting of a specific deck that makes it suitable for solo play. It’s on you to leverage the game’s complex mechanisms, which newly includes trading and economics, to build your civilization from scratch, without overextending yourself and collapsing into the ever-present threat of revolt. It’s a significant challenge with any one of the fourteen included civilizations, but when you realise each one requires a unique strategic approach, you’ll understand you’ve got a solitaire game of colossal replay value and depth.</p><h2>Gloomhaven / Frosthaven</h2><div><div id="155276"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Frosthaven" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/15/frosthaven-1686077923971-1708012440033.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Frosthaven</h3></p></div><div id="155277"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/10/gloomhaven-jaws-lion-1644509043015.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p><div><p>Playable as a standalone game, or as an expansion to Gloomhaven.</p></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the largest and most involved game on this list, Frosthaven is ideal for those pining for a grand fantasy adventure on the tabletop. In this legacy-style undertaking, you’ll guide an adventurer across a sprawling fantasy world teeming with dungeons and monsters. Card-driven tactical combat is at the name of the game, and each turn you’ll have to carefully consider what to play from your hand. The fact that you can lose cards permanently gives each decision significant weight, and the persistent world makes your experience vastly different from others’. Frosthaven is a vast yet personal game that is just begging to be explored over several sessions. If the scale and price are too much for you to play alone, consider the cut-down but still excellent Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion.

A sprawling fantasy epic from famed designer Vlaada Chvátil, Mage Knight was designed for 1-4 players, but it shines particularly well as a solitary experience. It’s a great choice when you’re in the mood for fighting monsters, upgrading your character, and exploring a fantasy setting. Make sure to set aside a large chunk of time, though, because games can last upwards of three hours, and each turn presents you with a puzzle-like series of actions that require a great deal of optimization.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h2><div id="157800"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/30/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-1648659069333.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p></div><p>Step into the shoes of literature’s greatest detective in this board game equivalent of a mystery novel. Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective includes a number of scenarios and fun props that really sell the experience. There’s a map of London, an address directory and a newspaper, each offering clues to hunt down and suspects to interview. Be warned, however, that this game does not hold your hand; each adventure presents a small amount of setup and exposition, and then sends you out into the city without much direction, leaving you to decide what locations to visit and who to accuse. This game gives you the chance to live up to Holmes’ reputation, which is a tall order given how though the mysteries can be.</p><p>You can check out more of our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">best mystery board games</a> if you like this one.</p><h2>Under Falling Skies</h2><div id="158414"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Under Falling Skies" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/05/under-falling-skies-1649182830734.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Under Falling Skies</h3></p></div><p>While solo options are fairly standard on most games nowadays, they can’t quite match those rare titles that venture to be solo only, such as Under Falling Skies. It’s a riff on Space Invaders as alien ships descent ever closer to the base you’re trying to protect. Under the pressure of their advance, you’ll have to balance a limited pool of dice between shooting them down, building your base and researching a final end to the alien menace. But there’s a beautiful catch: the higher the dice you use, the better the effect and the faster the alien above descends. With a variety of scenarios that can be recombined into a campaign, like those of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">best campaign board games</a>, this is a simple concept that will keep you gaming for a very long time. </p><h2>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</h2><div id="157792"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/30/robinson-1648658698630.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island</h3></p></div><p>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island casts players as shipwreck survivors on an island that is actively trying to kill them. There are several different characters to play as, each with various strengths and weaknesses. You will find yourself scavenging for food, building and upgrading shelters, and exploring perilous locations on the island. The game includes rules for a solo variant, but the general consensus is that it’s easier for a single player to simply take on the role of more than one character. There is a lot going on in Robinson Crusoe and the ample iconography can be a bit overwhelming, but those that stick it out will find a rewarding adventure that begs for return trips.</p><h2>Dinosaur Island: Rawr N’ Write</h2><div id="158416"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/05/dinosaur-island-rawr-1649183090562.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write</h3></p></div><p>Roll and write games, like co-op board games, often make very good solo fare because even multiplayer you’re all competing to make the best use of the same set of dice. Most, however, are too fast and simple for a compelling solitaire experience. Dinosaur Island: Rawr N’ Write is longer and more complex than its peers, but it pays off in a deeper, more satisfying game. Your dice rolls generate a wide variety of resources that you’ll need to balance carefully to build and run your Jurassic World style theme park. You even draw out the buildings on a grid and run tours through it but beware: if your security isn’t up to scratch, you may end up with fewer tourists than you started with.

The base game comes with a small handful of scenarios that send you directly into the jaws of cosmic mystery. You can use the suggested starter decks, or build a custom one centered around your chosen investigator’s special abilities. Gameplay sees you hopping from location to location to search for clues in order to advance the story while attempting to impede the deadly Mythos deck. Your investigator will inevitably take damage and acquire weaknesses over time that can affect future games in the campaign, making Arkham Horror: The Card Game one of the most thematic games on this list and one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">best horror board games</a> in general</p><h2>Cascadia</h2><div id="157128"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Cascadia" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/cascadia-1648059770674.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Cascadia</h3></p></div><p>While Cascadia is one of the very best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>, at first glance it doesn’t seem to offer much to a lone player. Sure the wildlife theme is appealing. And the simple yet addictive gameplay, where you choose pairs of random terrain tiles and animal tokens to add to your nature reserve to satisfy a range of scoring patterns, is fun enough. But what elevates it as a solitaire game is the list of achievements in the back of the rulebook. These task you to approach the game with different setups and rule tweaks, trying to reach particular score thresholds. Easy at first, the difficulty soon ramps up, giving you lots of varied challenges that are supremely satisfying to tick off, one by one.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review"><em>review of Cascadia</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Cartographers: Heroes</h2><div id="196838"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Cartographers: Heroes" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/cartographers-heroes-1709151138970.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Cartographers: Heroes</h3></p></div><p>A roll-and-write where the dice are replaced by cards, Cartographers: Heroes casts you as a royal surveyor seeking to map unexplored land in the name of your queen. Each turn, you’ll flip over a card that depicts both a terrain type and a Tetris-esque shape. You have to draw that shape and its terrain onto your grid map in a way that meets the random scoring conditions. The 16 possible goals include building a large contiguous village, completely filling out rows and columns of your grid, and drawing forest spaces on the edge of the map. Beware, though, because you may get ambushed by monsters at any time, and be forced to draw an inconvenient shape onto the map, forcing you to improvise in the future.</p><h2>Terraforming Mars</h2><div id="155280"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Terraforming Mars" src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/10/09/terraforming-mars1570648127955.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Terraforming Mars</h3></p></div><p>In this heavy Euro-style game, you’ll help make the Martian surface hospitable to human life by increasing the oxygen levels in the atmosphere, raising the temperature from below freezing, and by building man-made oceans to sustain life. This is done through a combination of resource management and tableau building. You’ll take on the role of a mega corporation looking to profit off of humanity’s foray onto the red planet. add In the solo game, you’ll race against the clock to maximize each of the three end game parameters. Every turn, you play new cards from your hand, meaning your list of available actions will grow until you’ve assembled a sprawling tableau of action cards that can combo off of each other. It’s a very crunchy game experience, which is perfect for those who appreciate a good optimization puzzle. There are also a number of expansion scenarios available, making Terraforming Mars one of the best solo experiences available, as well as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a>, too.</p><h2>Spirit Island</h2><div id="155274"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Spirit Island" src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/12/12/spirit-island1576180843140.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>By their nature, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board games</a> make for great solo experiences. Because of the players-versus-the-board structure, co-ops easily allow one person to control two or more players. One of the best co-op games in recent years is Spirit Island, a game about protecting your land from waves of vicious colonizers. You control island spirits, each with their own deck of power cards that help destroy settlements and repair land that’s been ravaged by agriculture. The strong theme and combo-heavy card play combine into one of the most robust cooperative experiences we’ve played. It just so happens to make an ideal solo game as well.</p><h2>Solitatire Board Game FAQS</h2><h2>Is it weird to play board games alone?</h2><p>Not at all! It's probably something that people have been doing for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. There's a 1697 French engraving that shows a woman at the King's court playing peg solitaire, and if it had reached the highest circles of nobility at that time, chances are it's a lot older. The solitaire card game that you've likely played on your computer at some point can be dated back to the late 1700s in northern Europe. Speaking of which, it's generally not thought odd for people to play video games like solitaire or far more complex fare alone, even in these internet-enabled times, so why should playing a board game by yourself be any different? In both cases, the enjoyment comes from trying to beat the challenge set by the game, and then trying again to see if you can better your own performance. Solo board games, much like their video counterparts, can also be enjoyed in part for the visual and tactile pleasures that they provide. It's no more peculiar than doing a jigsaw puzzle. </p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">best party board games</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">best deck-building card games</a>.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

            <p>Despite the many difficulties the games industry faces around the world, Swedish developers are feeling somewhat optimistic as the local development scene continues to experience rapid growth.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Dataspelsbranschen spokesperson Per Strömbäck says the general state of the Swedish games industry is "good", with the number of people working in the industry having grown from 2,500 to 8,500 people in the last decade.</p>
<p>He notes that while there are fewer vacancies at the moment due to the current global economic turmoil, there "aren't as many layoffs as in some other places, and the industry here is still growing."</p>
<p>Strömbäck says the current greatest strength in the Swedish games industry is the diversity in its titles, while the challenge will be to "ride out the economic downturn and retain investments."</p>
<p>"It is harder now for new studios to find funding and to rely on external investment," he explains. "But we have already seen a couple of really great releases such as Helldivers 2, and plenty of other titles still going strong. So we keep making great games, which is what we do best."</p>
<p>Strömbäck also expressed surprise at how quickly the Swedish games industry has "matured" within the last decade, and that it has struck the right balance between AAA, indie, and mobile studios in its ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The innovation and creative hunger is unmatched in such a small and concentrated location"</p>
<cite>Oskar Wolontis, Hazelight Studios</cite></blockquote>
<p>Two of its most successful developers include Hazelight Studios and Midjiwan, the creators of It Takes Two and The Battle of Polytopia respectively.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios COO Oskar Wolontis agrees with Strömback's assessment of the Swedish games industry, adding that its rich history in gaming has solidified Sweden's place on the games industry radar – especially when it comes to talent.</p>
<p>"All this combined ensures Sweden has one of the best game development talent pools in the world," says Wolontis. "The experience, the innovation and creative hunger is unmatched in such a small and concentrated geographic location."</p>
<p>Midjiwan general manager Christian Lövstedt credits the culture that the industry has fostered over the years, as well as its ability to retain talent.</p>
<p>"The collaborative approach within [Swedish] studios has also proven effective in crafting innovative game titles," explains Lövstedt. "Moreover, Sweden's longstanding tradition of engineering has fostered an exceptionally high level of technical expertise within its game development community."</p>
<blockquote><p>"There is clear confidence from outside investors - we've collectively shown Sweden can release hit after hit on a global scale"</p>
<cite>Christian Lövstedt, Midjiwan</cite></blockquote>
<p>Lövstedt also notes the media attention from "major successes" such as Minecraft, which have contributed to the growth of the industry and have helped change perceptions and boost attention for smaller studios such as Midjiwan.</p>
<p>This growth has helped studios like Hazelight, which has utilised the local talent pool to expand its development team.</p>
<p>"The amount of raw talent in both the experienced developers but also the new graduates each year is mighty impressive," says Wolontis. "There is also clear confidence in the Swedish game development industry from outside investors – we’ve collectively shown we can release hit after hit on a global scale. This confidence in the local talent pool lowers the risk of investment and in turn fuels our ability to keep those hits coming."</p>
<p>He adds that developers from around the world have moved to Sweden, noting that the talent pool has become "much more diversified" and that for Hazelight, 10% of its studio is made up of game creators from other nationalities.</p>
<p>For Midjiwan, recruiting locally has been challenging because "the demand for talented game developers far exceeds supply," according to Lövstedt. The studio has a core team of Swedish developers based in Stockholm, with its community manager in California.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
<img alt="" height="371" loading="lazy" src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp 2x" width="720"> </a>
<figcaption>Midjiwan’s The Battle of Polytopia is in its ninth year, and shows no signs of slowing down</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Wolontis agrees with this. Despite having made use of local talent to help grow Hazelight, it was a challenge for the studio to get to that point.</p>
<p>"The interest in investing in the Swedish game development industry in recent years has been higher than the local talent pool can reasonably support," he explains. 

</p><p>"Granted, the surge of remote work during the pandemic and afterwards have somewhat been able to mitigate this. Yet talent is still in high demand regardless."</p>
<p>And as a smaller studio, Midjiwan is facing similar issues, as Lövstedt adds: "As a smaller studio, we face extra difficulties in attracting the best local talent since people tend to gravitate towards the bigger studios, believing it's safer (which is incorrect in our case)."</p>
<p>Another challenge faced by Swedish studios is a lack of support from the government. Strömbäck explains there's no dedicated policy for the games industry there, such as tax breaks or subsidies.</p>
<p>"The general tax incentive programs on research and development and such are available also to the games companies, but are difficult to use," he says. "There are some very successful incubators, but they are funded and operated on the local or regional level.</p>
<p>"So in terms of public support, Sweden actually has very little compared to some other prominent countries such as Finland, Canada, and the UK. However, higher education is public funded and we have some world class game education here."</p>
<p>Lövstedt also highlights the government facilitating education for games development, but notes there are "too few graduate students to fill the industry's needs" and because there are little to no incentives provided – especially when it comes to employment –  it can be hard for small studios to find footing.</p>
<p>"If you are a new studio, it can be very tough to get the business to work," he explains. "There are no government financial instruments or subsidies for employing people to help you out in the beginning. Many smaller companies address this by taking on external consultancy work, which results in less time to work on your own game title, which can itself become a vicious circle."</p>
<p>So what needs to change? Wolontis says the Swedish government needs to recognise the contributions that the "economic behemoth of an industry" can provide.</p>
<p>"When that happens, it will hopefully open the doors for more productive talks with the powers that be. Any new support systems focusing on ease of business and talent pool growth would be most welcome."</p>
<p>One way for the government to take note is by looking at the success of homegrown games. Midjiwan's turn-based strategy title The Battle of Polytopia is currently in its ninth year, having launched in February 2016, and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<p>"Our goal is for the game to remain popular for many years to come," said Lövstedt.</p>
<p>"We can't say too much about our pipeline, but we continuously make improvements, introduce new features, and create content so that players will continue to play it and new players will discover it."</p>
<p>Another success for the Swedish games industry is Hazelight's co-op platformer It Takes Two, which released in 2021. The title <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-takes-two-picks-up-game-of-the-year-at-2022-dice-awards">picked up Game of the Year at the 2022 DICE Awards</a> among dozens of other awards, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-takes-two-moves-16m-units-news-in-brief">surpassed 16 million sales this March</a>.</p>
<p>"We've shown the world that Sweden can still produce games with a whole new level of innovation never seen before – I want to say a completely new genre, even," Wolontis adds.</p>
<p>"It shows how creatively diverse the talent can be here with the right creative guidance. It Takes Two also happened to become our country's first global Game of the Year winner – that must count for something, right?"</p>

            <p>
Fans of EA Sports FC have responded angrily after EA altered a perceived issue with FUT rewards providing "unintended results".
</p>
<p>
As part of the game's Weekend League, players have a chance to win special versions of certain players, which this past weekend included Kylian Mbappe who's considered the best player in the game.
</p>
<p>
EA doesn't release the odds of receiving specific players, but Mbappe and other top players appeared to be cropping up more often than usual at the start of the weekend.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>

The company then shared a message on Saturday stating it had "identified an issue where the Champions Player Pick rewards were providing unintended results", which was then "corrected in-game".
</p>
<p>
Following the change, players believe EA nerfed the likelihood of the best footballers appearing to force more in-game purchases.
</p>
<p>
A community note on EA's X (formerly Twitter) post reads: "There may have been a probability issue, but there is no evidence of 'unintended rewards' being given out. Mbappe and Dembele are part of Ligue 1 TOTS, so they fit the reward description. EA lowered their chance because it will force players to open packs with real currency."
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have identified an issue where the Champions Player Pick rewards were providing unintended results. This has been corrected in-game.</p>— EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication (@EASFCDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASFCDirect/status/1789111173847396598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Many angry replies to the post are requesting EA change it back, as early players receiving the top rewards before the change are now dominating online.
</p>
<p>
"Leave it as it was, everyone was happy. Mad, legit mad that you 'intend' to shaft people for playing your competitive game mode," reads one response.
</p>
<p>
"Leave it as it was. Don't fix it so half the community that weren't busy on Friday night get Red Dembele/Mbappe and we get shafted," reads another. "Most out of touch company on this planet."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for further information.
</p>
<p>
EA has long had issues with controversial implementing of loot boxes, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-denies-its-pushing-fifa-players-to-spend-on-loot-boxes-after-insider-leaks-marketing-documents">company denying in 2021 it was "pushing" FIFA players to spend money in-game</a>.

</p>
<p>
Last week, EA's latest financial report revealed plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-teams-looking-at-thoughtful-implementations-of-ads-inside-its-game-experiences">potentially use in-game advertising to drive profits</a>.

            <p>The release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> in early access last week has given the original game a nice little player boost.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the first Hades game managed to beat its own concurrent player record on Steam, with 54,240 taking on the mythological rogue-like dungeon crawler over the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>That's 16,491 more concurrent players than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-launch-on-steam-reaches-over-100k-concurrent-players-24-hours-after-launch">Hades' previous record of 37,749</a>, which it set four years ago.</p>

<p>Despite this boost, Hades is still a way off surpassing the sequel's player numbers, with Hades 2 currently holding a concurrent player record of 103,567. But, regardless, it is great to see Supergiant's original game getting more attention. </p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer are rather fond of Hades, and named it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">our Game of the Year in 2020</a>. More specifically, our Christian Donlan was especially enamoured with the whole thing, calling it a "glittering headlong pelt through the underworld".</p>
<p>"Hades is a proper lark. I love it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-review-of-myth-and-mayhem">Eurogamer's Hades review</a>. "This game comes from Hell, and it takes you back there, and it's <em>brilliant</em>. Get in."</p>
<p>It definitely isn't a game to be mythed!</p>

<p>And, its sequel Hades 2 ain't half bad either. For more, be sure to read Donlan's thoughts in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="378" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Whereas Capcom had a fantastic 2024 fiscal year <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/capcom-celebrates-record-high-profits-and-sales-for-seventh-year-in-a-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with record-high profits</a>, Square Enix has not enjoyed the same level of success. In fact, it’s reported its profits are down by nearly 70% (69.7% to be exact) compared to the previous fiscal year. As such, Square Enix is committing itself to a new business strategy, which includes a greater focus on multiplatform releases.</p> <p data-characters="661" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">In <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a presentation shared on May 13</a>, Square Enix outlined a plan it’s calling ‘Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens,’ with the goal of achieving long-term growth over the course of three years. Among its key pillars, it highlights shifting to a multiplatform strategy, something the company intends to “aggressively pursue” and will cover PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC platforms. While Square Enix has launched plenty of multiplatform games in the past, it is known for limiting certain titles to specific platforms. In just the past 12 months, it launched <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xvi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a></em> as PlayStation 5 exclusives.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">It sounds like Square Enix has decided this approach isn’t in its best interests any more, and it would now rather get its games on as many platforms as it can. Some of its former platform exclusives have made the jump to other platforms after launch (for example, the first <em>Octopath Traveler</em> was a Nintendo Switch exclusive but was later ported to PC and Xbox), but Square Enix’s new strategy could also mean more simultaneous releases. So, no more time-limited exclusives either.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">Square Enix may also be considering bringing older titles to other platforms since it wants to “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles.” It doesn’t provide any specific examples, but it’d be nice if this means the likes of <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> and its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-vii-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a></em>, can make the jump to Xbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Making games more widely available seems like a fairly obvious solution to making more money. However, Square Enix also mentions wanting to focus on quality over quantity, which suggests it’ll reduce its output. So, Square Enix games will come out less frequently, but they’ll ideally be of high quality and more readily available to a wide audience.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Square Enix certainly needs to do something different if its HD games division isn’t turning a profit. Net sales were overall up compared to the 2023 fiscal year thanks to <em>FF16</em> and <em>FF7 Rebirth</em>, as well as <em>Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</em> and continued sales of the <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> collection, but operating losses grew due to “higher development cost amortization and advertising expenses.”</p>
 <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="false">In its <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal report</a>, Square Enix also reconfirmed it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sounds-like-square-enix-has-scrapped-140-million-worth-of-console-and-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost nearly $141 million in cancelled projects</a>. It had said it expected this back in April, but Square Enix has now explained precisely why these projects were scrapped. Essentially, it found them to be “incompatible” with its new strategy for growth and how it intends to develop HD games going forward. Again, it didn’t name any of the cancelled projects, but it’s likely these were unannounced titles rather than anything Square Enix has listed on its release schedule.</p>

 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">This sentiment was echoed throughout the community, with 2tan2tame saying that “the inclusion of all the other game modes and the XP drop has made me just stop playing,” while Jimlad116 said that after having a baby with his wife, they had previously been able to get through the season pass together but are “not even close to finishing the base Battle Pass this season” and is “honestly considering just quitting the game altogether.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">I personally have felt like the Battle Pass has made the game too grindy for a long time, and haven’t purchased one in a long time. Back in the days of Chapter 1 I could easily finish a Battle Pass in a season, but with more frequent seasonal updates, and the additional XP requirements, there’s just no way I’m going to get close. I already have a full-time job, and I can’t commit to playing four hours of <em>Fortnite</em> on top of that just to unlock some cosmetics. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">I understand that the idea of Battle Passes is to keep players hooked and coming back to your game, but there has to be a limit to this, otherwise, people will just give up and stop playing the game. It seems like <em>Fortnite</em> is about to reach that cliff edge, and they may need to pull back before it’s too late. </p>

            <p>Brass-blasting rhythm game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> honked its way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-deserves-to-toot-its-own-horn">into our hearts </a>when it released in 2022. Since then, it's garnered a dedicated fanbase that have kept its spit-valve full to bursting with creations like this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">Final Fantasy 7 mod</a>. Trombone Champ mods are special among rhythm games for consisting of two elements: the button-tapping composition of the song itself, and the background visuals. You honk-tap away while unicorns or giant close-ups of full English breakfasts cavort in the background. Although, if your breakfast is cavorting, you probably want to cook it a bit longer.</p>

<p>One community member, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Gloomhonk/videos">Gloomhonk</a>, has risen to legend status for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">creative and hilarious clips</a>, like <a href="https://youtu.be/Vn06ADuXDnQ">this take</a> on Don’t Stop Believin’ where you enrage the guitarist by bogarting all the solos.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A second remake of the original Resident Evil is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cqllq0/danielrpk_a_resident_evil_1_remake_is_in/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, DanielRPK, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, revealed on their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/resident-evil-104124284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> that a new remake of the first entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM powered by the RE Engine is now in development.</p>
<p>While DanielRPK did not reveal any additional information on the new Resident Evil remake, @PRE_Atarabiya revealed on X/Twitter that the game will be released in 2026 to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. Additionally, the user revealed some additional information on the yet-to-be-revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">ninth entry in the series</a>, saying that Leon Kennedy will be the main character in the game's introduction and will be 48 years old, as the game will be set in the Summer of 2025.</p>

<p>While a second remake of the original Resident Evil definitely makes a lot of sense, we have to take its existence with a grain of salt until an official confirmation comes in.

<p>Square Enix has announced in its financial earnings call that it will be releasing its games as multiplatform moving forward rather than releasing exclusively on one console.</p>



<p>The move to multiplatform is a part of Enix’ new strategy, <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which states</a>, “the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.”</p>



<p>Under the same changes to strategy, also outlined is the publisher’s shift from “quantity to quality”.</p>



<p>“The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts. It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.”</p>



<p>The change in strategy has already seen several of its games canceled, which did not align with Square Enix’s new approach.</p>



<p>As the industry continues to consolidate and games become increasingly expensive, it isn’t hard to see why Square Enix would like to broaden the number of platforms it releases its games on. With consoles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> expected to launch in Spring 2025, too, it isn’t difficult to see where Square is going with its new strategy—and it’s a strategy that is likely to be followed across the industry.</p>

            <p>Square Enix has released its financials for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, with the results largely below what it had previously forecasted.</p>
<p>As a result, the firm is set to implement a brand new strategy going forward, hoping to achieve "stable profit generation" in its digital entertainment segment by 2027.</p>
<section>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-1">The numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-2">The financial highlights</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-3">Looking ahead: The new strategy</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h2 id="section-1">The numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales</strong>: ¥356 billion ($2.28 billion, up 3.8% year-on-year from ¥343 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Digital entertainment sales</strong>: ¥248 billion ($1.59 billion, up 2.6% YoY from ¥245 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income</strong>: ¥32.5 billion ($208 million, down 26.6% YoY from ¥44.3 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Profit attributable to owners of parent</strong>: ¥15 billion ($96.2 million, down 69.7% YoY from ¥49.2 billion)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2">The financial highlights</h2>
<p>Square Enix's digital entertainment sales were ever so slightly up, mainly thanks to its HD Games sub-segment, the firm said. The solid performances of Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster, Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth saw HD Games sales increase to ¥99.2 billion ($636 million) versus ¥78.5 billion ($503 million) the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, the firm's MMO and Games for Smart Devices/PC Browsers sub-segments both declined year-on-year (11% and 10%, respectively), with the latter in particular seeing new releases underperforming and unable to compensate for weak performances from Square's back catalogue.</p>
<p>The operating losses across its digital entertainment segment were due to higher development cost amortisation and advertising expenses, it continued, as well as "higher content valuation losses versus the previous fiscal year."</p>
<p>Square Enix's results for the year were largely below what it had previously forecasted (for instance, it expected an operating income reaching ¥55 billion and it did ¥32 billion). Back in April, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-on-cancelled-games">the company had warned investors that its results for the year would be taking a hit</a> due to cancelled projects.</p>
<p>"Operating income, ordinary income, and profit attributable to owners of the parent for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were below the company’s forecasts primarily due to weaker HD games sales than expected in the Digital Entertainment segment and to the recognition of valuation and abandonment losses associated with its content production account following a close examination of the company’s development pipeline," the company said in its financial report.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Looking ahead: The new strategy</h2>
<p>As a result of this disappointing financial year, Square Enix will be implementing a new strategy going forward, it announced.</p>
<p>The company's previous strategy included a target to rebuild its portfolio across both the HD Games and Smart Devices segments, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-wants-to-slim-down-lineup">streamline said portfolios</a>, and expand its MMO business.</p>
<p>However, it said its journey to "better profitability in HD game development" has been "incomplete", adding: "[We] launched many titles but some failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles."</p>
<p>It also noted a slowdown in SD games, gaps in its management infrastructure, and "cannibalisation of our new titles due to the launch schedule's overlap."</p>
<p>Its new strategy to tackle these challenges is called "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens" and is a three-year plan targeting long-term growth. The company wants to enhance its productivity and release titles more regularly by "by optimising [its] development footprint," it said. That will involve revamping its organisation, retiring its "business unit-based organisational design."</p>

<img alt="" height="399" loading="lazy" src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-05-13-at-10.33.41.png?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-05-13-at-10.33.41.png?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-05-13-at-10.33.41.png?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp 2x" width="720"> </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The company said it will also "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs." For its SD segment too, Square said it'll be looking beyond iOS and Android, and at PC launches.</p>
<p>It also intends to step up digital sales in order to diversify its earnings opportunities, and further develop its IP across multiple media and markets.</p>
<p>The company is set to "rebuild its overseas business divisions from the ground up," it added. That will involve optimising costs across its European and American offices via "structural reforms."</p>
<p>Finally, the company said it'll be looking into making "strategic investments" to expand into "additional domains."</p>
<p>For the financial year 2025, Square Enix expects to increase its operating income to ¥40 billion ($256 millon), which would represent a 22.9% boost. However, the company forecast that its sales will continue to decline, down 13% to ¥310 billion ($1.98 billion).</p>
<p>It's also intending to achieve "stable profit generation from the overall DE segment and to generate a consolidated operating margin of 15% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027."</p>

            <p>
Square Enix is "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs".
</p>
<p>
The company's new medium-term business plan was shared today alongside its latest financial report, and follows news of both a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of its development system</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">abandonment of £112m of in-development projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
The multiplatform strategy is part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities" and aims to allow more customers to "enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalogue titles".

<p>
Square Enix's biggest releases in recent years have been console-exclusive to PlayStation, including the likes of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Final Fantasy 16, and Forspoken, with PC releases either alongside or in the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
While no specific games are identified here, it suggests that some of the company's biggest could make their way to Xbox in future - or perhaps Switch 2. At the least, Square Enix's biggest game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-14-new-series-xs-version-tested-vs-ps5">Final Fantasy 14 - made its way to Xbox recently</a>.
</p>
<p>
The strategy will "maximise digital sales of new titles" as well as "pursue initiatives designed to win over PC users" which the company sees as a growth opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The shift to multiplatform also includes mobile games, which will not only release on iOS and Android but potentially PC too. Mobile gacha game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-heading-to-steam">Final Fantasy Ever Crisis is already set for a Steam release</a>.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix will also "leverage IP across media formats", suggesting the likes of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest could be seen more outside of games.
</p>
<p>
The company's new development pipeline will shift from quantity to quality, balancing developer creativity with data from customers and the wider market. AAA releases will be released regularly, while "mid-class titles" will prioritise profitability. As such, it will be "bold" in creating new franchises, to prioritise "novel forms of excitement" balanced with earnings potential.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to focus on creating "unforgettable experiences", marketing talk for good games.
</p>
<p>
So why all this change? It's due to declining profits. The last financial year saw an increase in net sales of games of one percent, but a decrease in profit from games of 38 percent. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and the Pixel Remasters boosted sales, but a year-on-year decline in MMO and mobile games plus high development costs accounted for the loss in profit. The £112m write-off also impacted profits.</p>
<p>
No specific sales are given, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has reportedly underperformed</a> despite being the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">fourth biggest game in the US</a> so far this year.
</p>
<p>
Other sectors did fare better: merchandise profits, for instance, had a 51 percent increase in profit. 
</p>
<p>
So what's next for Square Enix? Most imminent is the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Final Fantasy 14 expansion Dawntrail</a>, which will likely provide a boost in profits. As previously reported, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">most profitable game in the series</a>, while previous expansion Endwalker was so popular the game had to be taken off sale.
</p>
<p>
After that, there is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-pc-version-in-final-stages-of-optimisation-director-says">PC release of Final Fantasy 16</a>, and a presumed PC release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth following its Remake equivalent.

            <p>There is a Star Wars mod for Helldivers 2 out there and it looks brilliant.</p>
<p>The mod in question was shared over the weekend by ToastedShoes, whose name you may recognise from that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-already-has-a-pokemon-mod">PC Pokémon mod for Palworld</a>. And, while they say it brings Clone Wars to Arrowhead's shooter, there is something about it that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-battlefront-3-dead-as-dice-focuses-fully-on-battlefield-report">makes me think of Battlefront 3, and what that could have been</a>. Hmm...</p>
<p>Anyway, I will bring myself back to the present, and this mod. As you may already have assumed, it is utterly chaotic, with players in Star Wars skins fighting enemies from the franchise such as Droideka and B1 droids. Roger Roger!</p>

<p>This marriage of bombastic Helldivers 2 gameplay with a Star Wars makeover honestly works so well. But, while I am itching to give this Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod a go for myself, it is currently not available publicly.</p>
<p>"Right now the mods don't work consistently across all planets and difficulties so we want to iron out the kinks before dropping them," ToastedShoes wrote in a post on social media platform X. However, the YouTuber did state the Star Wars mod will be made available "very shortly", so keep your eyes peeled.</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We will also be dropping the mod pack from this video in its entirety this week over on Nexus Helldivers 2 but ruined with mods<a href="https://t.co/40fmxqQGcW">https://t.co/40fmxqQGcW</a></p><p>Along with that we are planning on releasing the tools we built from the ground up, so you can all make your very own mods</p></div>— Toasted (@ToastedShoes) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789686363786485784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>"Thanks again for all your support and love! I can't wait to see the entire community enjoying the mods with friends," they closed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out ToastedShoes taking the Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod out for a spin in the video below.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has been immensely popular since it burst onto PlayStation and PC earlier this year, but that doesn't mean there hasn't been controversy. Earlier this month, publisher Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers 2 players on Steam would be required to link to a PlayStation Network account</a> - something it said this was always meant to be a requirement for players on PC.</p>
<p>The news was immediately met with intense backlash, which resulted in an influx of negative<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements"> reviews from Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">asked for a refund</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 was pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> where PSN is not available. All of this led Sony to ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturning plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</h2></div><section><p>Square Enix has announced a significant company reboot amid tumbling profits.</p><p>Reporting its financial performance for the financial year ending March 31, 2024, sales in the Digital Entertainment segment, which includes video games, rose by 2.6% but profit fell by 15.8%. This despite the sale of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. Specifically on HD games, the subcategory Square Enix uses to encompass all the above games, the company saw a significant operating loss of ¥8.1 billion (approximately $51.9 million).</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and while Square Enix <em>has</em> announced a sales figure for Final Fantasy 16, it has yet to do so for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the company’s trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes. In its financial report, all Square Enix would say is it has suffered from an “incomplete journey to better profitability in HD game development”, and that it had “launched many titles but some failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles.” It seems likely Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, at least, is included in that.</p><p>In response to the tumbling profits, Square Enix announced what it calls “Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens”, a three-year plan for rebooting for long-term growth. This involves a rethink across all parts of the business, but the highlight is a “shift to a multiplatform strategy." Square Enix said it will “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.” Note the wording here of “Nintendo platforms”, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">Nintendo set to announce its Switch successor console before April 2025</a>.</p><p>As part of this multiplatform push, Square Enix said it will "build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles." The suggestion in all this is mainline Final Fantasy games will ditch PlayStation exclusivity going forward, although Square Enix has yet to announce specifics beyond Final Fantasy 16's upcoming launch on PC.</p><p>There’s also a shift from quantity to quality, Square Enix said, and a bid to deliver “ensured fun.” Square Enix has been accused of pumping out too many Final Fantasy games in too short a timeframe, so perhaps this means the release of major Final Fantasy games will be spaced out a bit more.</p><p>Overall, it’s a tough time for Square Enix, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-in-content-abandonment-losses-as-it-revises-game-pipeline">which had already absorbed ¥22.1 billion (approx $140.9 million) in what it called “content abandonment losses” ahead of today’s financial report</a>. Square Enix did not name the canceled or rescoped in-development titles.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-dawntrail"><u>Dawntrail</u></a>, the expansion for ongoing MMO Final Fantasy 14, launches in late June. Square Enix also has <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate"><u>Dragon Quest 12</u></a> in the works.</p><p>In February, Square Enix director and president Takashi Kiryu reportedly told analysts about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-reportedly-overhauling-how-it-makes-games"><u>plans to create a new company structure</u></a> following falling sales in its digital entertainment business, despite the release of Final Fantasy 16 in June. Square Enix said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-sold-3-million-copies-during-launch-week"><u>the PS5 exclusive sold three million copies</u></a> during launch week. A PC port is in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-it-may-be-time-for-the-younger-generation-to-handle-final-fantasy-17"><u>it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Call of Duty 2026 and Call of Duty 2027 details might have been leaked by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Although this year's and next year's Call of Duty entries have yet to be officially announced, we might already have some early details on the 2026 and 2027 installments. According to known Call of Duty leaker Tom Henderson, next year's <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoD will be a semi futuristic Black Ops 2 seque</a>l, and as now<a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1789753516757524538" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted</a> on X by known leaker VISCERAL, Call of Duty 2026 will be a new CoD: Ghosts entry. According to the leaker, this new entry is being developed by Infinity Ward and is currently codenamed "Project Devilwood". In addition, CoD 2027, with codename "Project Anvil", is said to be a new Advanced Warfare title from Sledgehammer Games.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CALL OF DUTY 2026<br>"Project Devilwood" in development at Infinity Ward and will be a Ghosts title.</p>
<p>CALL OF DUTY 2027<br>"Project Anvil" in development at Sledgehammer and will be an Advanced Warfare title.</p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/Vondyispog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Vondyispog</a> <a href="https://t.co/7FCRN0xe02">pic.twitter.com/7FCRN0xe02</a></p>
<p>— VISCERAL (@zvis_ceral) <a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1789753516757524538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't been able to verify these details, and as such, the information above should be taken with a pinch of salt for now. Since 2015, the Call of Duty series has had a three-year development cycle with Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer trading off development duties. "This fall's game will be Treyarch's first on the three-year development cycle," Activision Publishing former CEO Eric Hirshberg said about Black Ops III during an earnings call back in 2015. "It will be loaded with innovation, and we're excited to share more details with our community soon."</p>
<p>Last month, the leaker posted some additional details about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splinter Cell Remake</a> from Ubisoft. According to the leaker, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-stealth-ray-traced-reflections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the remake will feature ray-traced audio</a>, and enemies being able to detect the player based on ray-traced reflections.</p>
<p>More details about this year's Call of Duty entry will likely be revealed in the coming months. Late last year we <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered that the game might have a Gulf War settin</a>g.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this 'leak'? Will Call of Duty 2026 indeed be a new Ghosts entry? And what about CoD 2027? Hit the comments below.</p>

            <p>Sony has reportedly formed a new studio made up of former Deviation Games employees.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7190611686209249280/">LinkedIn</a>, former technical director Michael Anthony suggested that the studio is "working on an undisclosed IP".</p>
<p>"All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers," he wrote. "I hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with the red tape of previous projects."</p>
<p>It would seem Deviation Games co-founder Jason Blundell is involved with the studio. As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-reportedly-forms-studio-with-former-deviation-games-devs/">VGC</a>, former employee JC Farmer shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938">social media</a> last December that they landed a job as a junior game designer at PlayStation, adding that they work for Blundell.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Sony for further clarification.</p>
<p>Deviation Games was founded in 2020 by Blundell and Dave Anthony, known for their work on the Call of Duty franchise.</p>
<p>The studio was working on a new IP for PlayStation, as announced at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-elden-ring-highlight-summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest in 2021</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jason-blundell-exits-from-deviation-games">Blundell left the studio in September 2022</a>, with Anthony continuing to lead the studio as CEO and game director.</p>
<p>Deviation Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/deviation-studios-reportedly-lays-off-up-to-90-staff">went through a round of layoffs last May</a> in which up to 90 workers lost their jobs. The studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-backed-deviation-games-closes">announced its closure in March this year</a>.</p>

            <p>Some fresh astral god trivia from my accidental molar expedition a few weeks back: each of the Maw's teeth is different. Some form a fractal baleen network of crosshatched layers disappearing backward into the vanishing point; others are shaped like lockpicks, raccoon heads and semi-detached houses. This week's new game releases are no less motley and misshapen, though thankfully not quite as heavily varnished with plaque: there's something in the shop for everyone, I think. </p><!--more-->
<p>Today, the 13th May, we open with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a>, the long-awaited space strategy-me-do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">which Nic has already reviewed and is broadly fond of</a>. It's gracefully accompanied by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131010/The_Land_Beneath_Us/">The Land Beneath Us</a>, a turn-based rogue-lite dungeon crawler in which you tunnel into an underworld inspired by Welsh mythology. 14th May brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671720/Athenian_Rhapsody/">Athenian Rhapsody</a>, which brazenly describes itself as "a souls-like platonic dating simulator with cooking-mama and WarioWare style battle mechanics". On the 15th, there's android-bisecting boomer shooting from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131010/The_Land_Beneath_Us/">Mullet Madjack</a>, period RTSing from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128860/Men_of_War_II/">Men Of War 2</a>, and  Paper Mario-ish choose-your-own adventuring from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866320/Baladins/">Baladins</a>.</p>
<p>And then, on the 16th, a perfect singularity of little and large, eccentric and mainstream titles in the shape of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674590/Histera/">Histera</a>, a free-to-play PvP shooter in which the arena glitches between time periods, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293910/Read_Only_Memories_NEURODIVER/">Read Only Memories: Neurodiver</a>, sequel to the 2015 hit 2064: Read Only Memories, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Ghost Of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a>, the PC port of the open world samurai blockbuster, and Simogo's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/">Lorelei And The Laser Eyes</a>, which sounds a bit like an Agatha Christie story spliced with the Crystal Maze. For an intellectual end to the week on 17th May, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356150/Arcane_Assembly/">Arcane Assembly</a>, a metroidvania in which you program your own spells using a visual scripting language.</p>
<p>Not a bad showing, I reckon! I'll be off on an Exciting Press Trip from Thursday morning - amongst other things, I'm attending the latest Digital Dragons conference in Poland. As ever, you can follow our increasingly baffled and self-defeating attempts at journalism in the liveblog below, and we welcome suggestions in the comments about games or events we've missed.</p>

    Square Enix have published some <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf">financial results</a>, which includes a new "medium-term business plan" in which they will "pursue a shift from quantity to quality". Basically, the last couple of years led to some losses for the company, and they're changing tack. Presumably that means making fewer games. It's all in keeping with what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-112m-in-content-abandonment-losses-as-it-seeks-to-be-more-selective">the company said recently about being "more selective"</a>.

    Via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/former-helldivers-2-lead-writer-burned-out-hard-while-updating-the-near-flawless-live-service-game-i-absolutely-destroyed-myself/">Games Radar</a>, former Helldivers 2 lead writer Russ Nickel has spoken about the burnout he experienced while creating the ongoing story for the live service shooter. "I wanted Helldivers 2 to be so perfect that I absolutely destroyed myself. I abandoned my friendships, I pulled all-nighters. The company wasn't asking me to do that, it was just I cared so much about making it good that it totally consumed me." I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that from everything we know of crunch, it's just as often an unspoken mandate as an explicit ask, but it does sound like a case of genuine passion here.

It included no-nos on:</p>
<p><em>a. Making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material, such as game features, characters, or music.</em></p>
<p><em>b. Engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of "Marvel Rivals" or providing subjective negative reviews of the game.</em></p>
<p>While this is all ridiculous, the "satrical comments" part seems especially irksome. Trying to control the tone of coverage is one thing, but telling people they can't be anything but reverent towards your deriative hero shooter is something else. Anyway, at least they've apologised. For being caught. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported financial results</a> for the fiscal year that ended on March 31. The results weren't great, as the Japanese publisher narrowly missed the revenue target and majorly missed the operating income target, with the latter also down 26.6% compared to last year.</p>
<p>However, Square Enix also announced today a brand new medium-term business plan that will last through March 31, 2027. The plan's title is Square Enix Reboots and Awakens – 3-years<br>
of Foundation-Laying for Long-term Growth. The key changes compared to the studio's previous plan are an aggressive multiplatform strategy and a focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For HD titles, the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.</em><br>
<em>In addition, it will also devise a platform strategy for SD titles that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches. Furthermore, the Group will strive to maximize the acquisition of new users when launching a title and that of recurring users after starting management of game operation.</em></li>
<li><em>The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts.</em><br>
<em>It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the multiplatform strategy, it is likely that the commercially underwhelming launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XVI</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ff7-rebirth-sales-ffxvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> have finally pushed Square Enix to forego PlayStation exclusive debuts of its premiere franchise. Both games, despite strong critical reception (especially of FFVII Rebirth), failed to sell as much as the publisher wanted, having only been released for PS5. In the future, it's likely Square Enix will strive to launch games day and date on all available platforms.</p>

<p>For the period between FY 2025 and 2027, Square Enix has set the following financial targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidated operating margin of 15% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027.</li>
<li>A maximum of ¥100 billion ($641 million) for total strategic investments (growth investments or shareholder returns) over a three-year period, including up to ¥20 billion ($128 million) for potential repurchases of Square Enix's own shares between May 14, 2024 and May 13, 2025.</li>
<li>The Group will strive to achieve ROE (return on equity) of at least 10%, shifting to a management approach mindful of capital efficiency.</li>
</ul>

In addition, while keeping balance between the creativity of its individual employees and the management centered on the organization, the Group will transition to a project management structure. To that end, the Group will redefine the mission for producers and other related employees and organize its internal supporting structure. Also, the Group will improve its development investment efficiency, by reviewing the overall management process of title development.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(2) Diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Shift to a multiplatform strategy</strong><ul><li>For HD titles, the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> platforms, <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,019 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,006 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, and PCs. Especially, in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles. In addition, it will also devise a platform strategy for SD titles that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches.

It will also promote intra-Group collaboration in Japan and abroad and strengthen the functions of its London development site. For example, the Group intends to work to strengthen the close collaboration between its divisions in Japan (creative studios and publishing) and to enable greater mobility of talent between them and the Group’s publishing functions overseas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Revamp policies on human resource allocation &amp; investment to balance both “creativity and productivity” in Japan</strong><ul><li>The Group will build its flat organization by increasing opportunities of promotion by selection in order to pursue a new talent at our company and streamlining the process of decision-making. Specifically, it will roll out a new human resources system in line with integrated management of development functions, building a new system for hiring, promotion, and appointment of management. Moreover, the Group will rebuild training system for new graduates and introduce internal education programs to enhance capabilities of junior and mid-level employees.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enhance business infrastructure by implementing PDCA cycle in a timely and appropriate manner</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue refining its management accounting system that enables greater visibility into business activities.

It will explore the possibility of undertaking inorganic investments designed to expand its business domains and create greater stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, to reward its shareholders, the Group will issue regular dividends based on a basic policy of achieving a dividend payout ratio of 30%. In addition, in a change from its previous approach to capital allocation, the Group has set aside ¥20 billion for the funding of potential repurchases of its own shares to be executed flexibly between May 14, 2024 and May 13, 2025 based on consideration of factors including strategic investment opportunities, the Group’s financial position, and its share price. The firm has also revised the breakdown of its per-share dividends (interim dividend and year-end dividend).</p><p>Through these initiatives, the Group will strive to further enhance its corporate value.</p></blockquote><p>Further information is available via <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square Enix’s medium-term business plan presentation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you go onto any anime streaming site, chances are you’ve seen anime with wacky titles like <em>Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon</em> or <em>Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?</em> While the titles make them sound like April Fool’s jokes, these are real anime and are part of a popular subgenre known as <strong>isekai</strong>. </p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">In isekai, protagonists are transported or reincarnated into another world vastly different than their own. Seeing the protagonist develop confidence, gain strength, and grow into the shoes of a hero makes isekai anime very appealing to fans of all ages.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">While I couldn’t tell you why so many isekai have odd titles that reveal the majority of the plot, I <em>can</em> tell you what the 10 best isekai anime of all time are.</p>

Due to Earth’s lack of magic, Satan and his demon generals lose their powers and are transformed into humans. Satan takes up the name, “Sadao Maou,” and gets a job at MgRonalds (a parody of McDonald’s). Instead of waging war, Sadao and the generals face the struggles of life at minimum wage, while spending their time off figuring out how to return to their world.</p>

 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">After Tsukasa wakes up in an MMORPG known simply as The World, he struggles to remember who he was and how he got into the game. After realizing that he can’t log out of the game, he begins his search for answers.

 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><em>Gate</em> is a balanced blend of both a regular isekai and reverse isekai. Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) officer Youji Itami travels through a mysterious gate into a fantasy world ripe with supernatural creatures and medieval warriors after said beings invaded Tokyo. Youji and his team work to create an alliance with the empire on the other side of the gate and add a diverse cast of fantasy characters to their group along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The humor is, at times, on the mature end of the spectrum, with silly depictions of war between warriors clad in iron armor against attack helicopters, mortar teams, and modern-day assault rifles. But despite its violence, <em>Gate</em> is an appealing isekai that explores a difficult path to coexistence between different worlds.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. <em>Overlord</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G69PZ5PDY/overlord">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="overlord ainz and albedo" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>

But while every world needs heroes to save it, they also need villains to be saved from. Ainz Ooal Gown, an overpowered elder lich, sets out to conquer the world alongside his loyal cast of followers.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">After experiencing all the world has to offer, his final quest is to put his power to the test and see just how OP he has become. <em>Overlord</em> is packed with non-stop entertainment, with lovable characters and some of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-anime-with-op-main-characters/">most ridiculous displays of power in all of anime</a>.</p>

While his party members include a goddess, an un-killable knight, and a famous magician, their contrasting personalities end up being the fuel for most of the series’ conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">Despite having the Adventurer job (class) and being much lower level than his companions, Kazuma ends up being the glue that holds everything together.

 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">Minoru has always wanted to rule from the shadows. After being reincarnated into another world, Minoru takes advantage of his new life as Cid Kagenou and becomes the mysterious Shadow, leader of Shadow Garden.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Cid amasses followers and tasks them with looking into the rise of a fake group known as the Cult of Diabolos, an imaginary enemy that sounds fitting for Shadow Garden. Unbeknownst to Cid, his imagination influences the development of the world around him. The conspiracies and intrigue actually become real.</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Cid’s grandiose lines, and the lengths he goes to be the most dramatic character he can be, makes <em>Eminence in Shadow</em> stand out amongst the typical isekai anime of recent years.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3.<em> Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRGG9798R/rezero--starting-life-in-another-world-">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Re:Zero subaru and emilia holding hands" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">While its cast of bright-haired twin maids and cute creatures make it seem like another cutesy isekai, <em>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</em> is quickly filled with death and conflict for protagonist, Subaru Natsuki.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">After being transported to a fantasy world, Subaru is cursed with a power that, at first, doesn’t sound too bad: “Return by Death.” Much like an autosave feature from video games, Subaru’s power becomes a cycle of failure and death, as he learns that this world is anything <em>but</em> a game. Subaru has to learn to make the most out of each resurrection, in order to save the people around him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false"><em>Re:Zero</em> is an isekai that punches above its weight and can hold its own when compared to the most popular anime. While it checks off all of the boxes for what makes a satisfying isekai, it boasts character development and emotional appeal that isn’t always expected from the isekai genre.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYZJ43JMR/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="That time i got reincarnated as a slime rimuru" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Satoru Mikami ends up being reincarnated as a slime after losing his life. While slimes are typically considered a bottom-tier monster in any fantasy world, Mikami is granted a few unique abilities based on his final thoughts before his death. With his built-in AI-like Great Sage assistant, and the Predator ability that makes him a slime version of Kirby, Mikami—now known as Rimuru Tempest—seeks to be a Demon Lord, the pinnacle of all monsters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">With his newly acquired powers, Rimuru focuses on building a nation of monsters that allows his fellow monsters and followers to have a peaceful place in the world. <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime’s</em> Rimuru ends up becoming one of the wisest and most inspirational isekai protagonists of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. <em>Inuyasha</em></h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70204995">Netflix</a></p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="inuyasha and kagome clouds" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Viz Media</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Since its anime debut in 2000,<em> Inuyasha</em> can be found in nearly every conversation or online debate over what is considered the greatest anime of all time.&nbsp;High school student Kagome Higurashi is sent back in time to the Sengoku period in Japan to help a half-demon, Inuyasha, recover the shards of a powerful jewel. While at first the two are hesitant to trust each other, Inuyasha and Kagome form a slow-building romance that influences their fates.</p>
 <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="false">Whether you’re looking to get into anime for the first time or you’ve been transported into the past and want to experience the classics, <em>Inuyasha</em> is the isekai anime for you. It’s difficult to pin one genre to <em>Inuyasha</em>, since it does everything so well that you’ll often forget that it was an isekai. The animation, though over 20 years old, still holds up wonderfully. The romance between Inuyasha and Kagome rivals that of many other love stories in romance anime, all while treating fans to a decade-long adventure that contains something that every type of anime fan can appreciate.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Our natural fear of the unknown immediately makes us keen on blending Science Fiction with Horror, but the combination isn’t all that easy to pull off.

 <h2 data-injectable="false">Cloverfield (Matt Reeves, 2008)</h2> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Movies about big monsters ravaging through a city rarely fail to entertain, no other did it better than Cloverfield, the only film courageous enough to ask people to experience all the fear and devastation in first person perspective.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">The found footage genre can go from scarily horrifying to incredibly good at putting you to sleep. After <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, <em>Cloverfield </em>is likely the most interesting attempt at this genre — and one of the best Kaiju films ever made.<br></p>

 <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">There’s no lack of cool jumpscares and monster designs here, but <em>The Myst</em> never stops being about family, a family that ends up having to face making a decision that you’ll never forget.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Jeff Goldblum before the accident" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Fly (David Cronenberg, 1986)</h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><em>The Fly</em> references in <a href="https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Fly">more popular media</a> are so prevalent that younger audiences might attribute the accidental mix between a person and an insect to a surprisingly popular trope, not a specific film. Still, David Cronenberg’s <em>The Fly</em> is much more than the imagining of one of humanity’s (apparent) greatest fears. </p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Though we tend to remember the scene of the accident and the very gory climax of the film, the entire deterioration of Jeff Goldblum’s character is more than worthy of everyone’s time.<br></p>

Yes, even though it features spooky monsters and scientific concepts are thrown around, those take the backseat to a surprisingly great love story between a regular guy and a mysterious Italian woman. <em>Spring</em> would’ve been an interesting experiment even if it had failed in the daunting task it set out to achieve, but it doesn’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false"> It’s heartbreaking that not many people know about this one, and there’s only one way to fix that.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Empty London" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Google Play</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2003)</h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">While it’s only natural to think of George A. Romero’s movies or <em>Resident Evil</em> when you think about Zombies, it’s hard to deny how much <em>28 Days Later</em> revitalized the genre.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Running infected were some of the most divisive movie monsters when we first saw them, but now we can all admit they’re much scarier than the classic zombie type. Also, <em>28 Days Later</em> doesn’t just rest upon this update, as it weaves a personal and at some points even heartwarming tale of survival in an outbreak-ravaged England that you’ll never forget.<br></p>

Instead, it masterfully shows the slow descent into madness of a ship’s crew that accidentally strayed off course and has to come to terms with the possibility of never reaching the destination.</p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">While <em>Aniara</em> doesn’t feature jumpscares, it’s hard to ignore all the existential dread it fills viewers with by constantly giving them new hope and squashing it in front of their eyes.</p> <figure data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="One of the Cube's &quot;contestants&quot;" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Cube (Vincenzo Natali, 2000)</h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">As far as low-budget sci-fi horror goes, I doubt you can do better than <em>Cube</em> — In fact, some of its darkest aspects are so well-conceived that you’ll have a hard time noticing it was even low-budget. </p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><em>Cube</em> invites viewers to experience a reality where a bunch of people are seemingly put at random into a megastructure composed of cubes that lead into other cubes, some of which feature deadly traps. The movie offers no answers, which helps the incredible violence of <em>Cube</em> feel extremely alien — or something late-stage capitalist humans would totally come up with.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Alien (1979) - Trailer HD 1080p" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4v4Kn0J6E-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979)</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">Ever since the release of <em>Aliens</em>, fans have been arguing over which is the best between the two original <em>Alien </em>films. <em>Aliens</em> fits more neatly in the sci-fi action category, and, as for the main reason why it’s not featured on this list, well, I just don’t think it measures up to the original.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Alien </em>from 1979 set an incredibly high bar for Sci-Fi horror by introducing us to a story equal parts Sci-Fi and Gothic Horror. Unlike <em>Aliens</em>, <em>Alien</em> revels in its buildup, and the moments we spend trying to understand what’s happening and watching the Xenomorph grow are as enthralling as the moments we spend being afraid once this perfect killing machine reaches maturity.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Predator" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Predator (John McTiernan,1987)</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">If you like the action of <em>Die Hard</em>, <em>Terminator</em>, or even <em>Commando</em>, <em>Predator </em>has that for you, but what sets it apart is a brilliant genre subversion. <em>Predator</em> follows a group of soldiers led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are naturally the biggest and baddest dudes in the world — but not in the Universe.</p> <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="970" data-injectable="true">After a mission in which Arnie’s squad kills an entire battalion like it was a video game tutorial, they start dropping one by one in a gruesome fashion. Out of nowhere, what you thought would be another celebration of testosterone, turns into a slasher where the hopeless victims are all badasses you’d think each could’ve carried their own horror movies. On top of all the beautifully well-realized Sci-Fi and Horror crossover, <em>Predator</em> cements <em>Arnie</em> as the greatest action hero of them all by showing how the man isn’t afraid of getting slapped around by something bigger and stronger that forces him to use his wits to come out on top.<br></p>

It’s the sense of dread you cannot shake by having to constantly wonder who’s the monster and who’s just an equally dangerous human on the verge of losing it.</p>
 <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">John Carpenter’s loose remake of Howard Hawks’s <em>The Thing</em> <em>From Another World</em> was a critical and commercial flop upon release, with Roger Ebert <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thing-1982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing it</a> as little more than ”&nbsp;a gross-out movie in which teenagers can dare one another to watch the screen”. Still, I believe there’s no better possible laurel for a sci-fi work than coming out ahead of its time, and <em>The Thing</em> was quick to get a cultural reappraisal that propelled it into the podium of sci-fi horror, which it hasn’t left since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's when to grab a Nintendo Switch on sale this year.</h2></div><section><p>The Nintendo Switch is one of the most popular consoles of all time, with over 140M units sold to date. With an extensive library of exclusive titles available, you can spend hundreds of hours exploring the library without ever getting bored. With so many games to play, a Nintendo Switch is a must-own console if you wish to play some of the most popular games each year. 2024 is set to bring a remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, a remaster of Luigi's Mansion 2, and many more <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a> we've yet to discover.</p><p>Like all hardware, the Nintendo Switch tends to go on sale at specific points throughout the year. If you are interested in picking up Nintendo's portable system, you can snag a Switch on sale if you buy at the right time. We've compiled together the best times to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-consoles">buy a Nintendo Switch</a> below, complete with every sale you might see a deal at. </p><h2>Best Times to Buy a Nintendo Switch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/07/switch-blogroll-1656326807534-1656337488233-1660451221826-1667834141044.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3><p>Like most video game consoles, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday are the best times of the year to buy a Nintendo Switch. Each year, Nintendo has released the same console bundle for Black Friday: a Red/Blue Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundled in for free. While this deal is priced at $299 every year, it is possible Nintendo will discount it further as the Switch approaches the end of its lifetime. </p><p>We've also seen Black Friday deals on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-lite">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, where a free game and discount are bundled together. It is anyone's guess as to what Nintendo will have to offer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2024, but we would count on the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle returning for another go around.</p><p>2024 will likely see some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Switch deals</a> ever considering the Switch 2 will be releasing sometime in 2025.</p><h3>Holiday Weekends</h3><p>Another great time to pick up a Nintendo Switch is one of the major holiday weekends in the United States. This includes Memorial Day Weekend, Independence Day, President's Day, and Labor Day. More often than not, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy will host exclusive three day sales, which sometimes can include deals on Nintendo Switch hardware. These discounts usually are locked behind memberships like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-walmart-plus">Walmart +</a> and My Best Buy Plus/Total, so do keep this in mind if you are aiming for the best deals.</p><h3>Amazon Prime Day</h3><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Prime Day</a> is always one of the most popular sales events of the year, and naturally, you can usually find a good Nintendo Switch deal here. In addition to hardware, dozens of games and Switch accessories are always on sale. This makes Prime Day one of the best times to buy a Nintendo Switch, as you can save money on both the console and accessories alongside it. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day 2</a>, which takes place in October, also acts as the beginning of the Black Friday deals season. This event usually takes place sometime in October based on past years. So, any major Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals are likely to be available during this sales event as well.</p><h3>Clearance Sales</h3><p>Recently, retailers like Woot have listed Nintendo Switch models for prices we've rarely seen before, sometimes up to $75 off. These deals happen spontaneously, mostly when the retailer is clearing inventory out. To catch these deals as they happen, we recommend following the <a href="https://twitter.com/IGNDeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Deals account</a> to get notified immediately.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that these same retailers offer open-box and refurbished units at an even lower price, so if you are okay with open-box purchases, consider this as an option. These consoles are certified, which means the retailer has tested and verified the condition of the console. Often, the "Excellent" refurbished consoles are simply open box, with not a scratch on the system itself.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 is Coming Soon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/14/nintendoswitchsymbols2-blogroll-logos-1686770489792.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo Switch is officially seven years old as of March 2024, with its eighth year in the market officially underway. Since console generations tend to last around seven to eight years at the very most, we do expect Nintendo to release a Switch successor sometime within the next nine months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">According to recent reports</a>, Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to feature magnetic Joy-Con, a 1080p screen, and more.</p><p>Since a release date is on the horizon, the price of Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-oled-model">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> are all likely to drop significantly as we head closer to Switch 2. If you are comfortable waiting to purchase a Switch, you can likely score the console at an all-time low towards winter 2024.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

The latter revolves around precise inputs and incentivizes the use of creative character builds. Players will also find a comprehensive story mode here, which holds tightly to its source material. The mode is the core of the experience and must be played to unlock key mechanics and features. </p>

Even if still dated for some, its combat can also be seen as the branch upon which <em>Genshin Impact</em> grew. In it, you can switch among up to three characters while performing groundbreaking attacks and being light on your feet. </p>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The debut of its Part 2 in February 2024 also made the game more approachable than ever. Part 2 brought to <em>HI3</em> a visual upgrade and a new storyline featuring both a fully explorable map and a new main cast </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">8.

 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">A sleeping hit for many, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/reverse-1999/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reverse: 1999</a></em> puts players in the role of the Timekeeper Vertin in her quest to stop the destruction caused by the Storm. During the story, she will then travel through multiple time periods. Each stop will present you with additions to the main cast and distinct settings. </p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The game also has in its combat system a huge plus by featuring a mix of card and turn-based mechanics. Its noir feel and intricate character models also help differentiate <em>R1999 </em>from its peers and make it a worthy pick for all. </p>

A courtesy of its above-average pull rates and generous rewards in the early/mid-game. <em>Nikke </em>also sets itself apart by being a shooter and allows you to take squads of up to five characters to the field. Although the game features many idle mechanics, you will need to be present for the best results in certain battles. </p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The title’s narrative also manages to score big hits when it counts and excels, given its production value. As an extra, <em>Nikke</em> is<em> </em>known for receiving crossovers with many popular franchises. The latest brought <em>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World’s</em> Ram, Rem, and Emilia to the game. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Arknights (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Hypergryph</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true"><em>Arknights</em> is a highly technical tower defense game where character placement and an understanding of the terrain and enemies can make or break you. Thankfully, the game allows players to apply a multitude of different strategies by picking among its hundreds of Operators. Its narrative is another plus, as it feels engaging and succeeds in doing justice by its cast and making you feel like a part of it. </p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Like <em>Nikke</em>, <em>Arknights</em> can be considered F2P friendly. That can be seen in how select 4-star Operators like Myrtle can perform on par with premium and featured units. You can also clear late-game stages while using only low-star characters. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Punishing: Gray Raven ( PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false"><em>Punishing: Gray Raven</em> puts players in the shoes of the Commandant of the Gray Raven squad, as they and the constructs under their command fight in the war against the Corrupted. The game is considered a standard, given its polished visuals and fast-paced combat style. The latter of which is focused on performing perfect dodges and well-timed combos. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Its overall style and the quality of its narrative also cause<em> PGR</em> to be constantly compared to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/nier-automata/">Nier: Automata</a></em>. So if you are a fan of PlatinumGames’ epic and are looking for an engaging narrative, you will feel right at home. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. AFK Journey ( PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lilith Games and Farlight Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">A spin-off of the hugely popular <em>AFK Arena</em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/afk-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AFK Journey</a> </em>allows players to assemble squads of up to five heroes to take part in many modes. The latter is also where the game shines, as you can find options for fans of open-world exploration, standard PVP, and even roguelikes. As most modes do not demand many inputs, <em>AFK Journey </em>can also be seen as the ideal pick for all looking for a game to run in the background.</p>
 <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="128" data-injectable="false"><em>AFK Journey </em>is the most F2P-friendly name in our list by a large margin given its generous rewards and daily mode availability. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Fate/Grand Order (Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lasengle</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Royalty in the genre, <em>Fate/Grand Order</em> continues to be a solid pick almost a decade after its release. As a branch of the Fate series, the game allows players to control more than 450 Servants as they take part in highly tactical turn-based battles. Players can also deepen their connection with each servant and unlock special interactions and quests by completing various activities. </p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Diving into <em>FGO </em>will demand a lot of catching up. Fortunately, the game’s community is known for being extremely receptive and it’s sure to offer a home to all, newcomers or seasoned masters alike.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">2. Genshin Impact (PS5 / PS4 / PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">The title responsible for shaking up the market,<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact </a></em>sits at the top as the current flagship of the gacha genre. </p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><em>Genshin</em> offers the full package to fans by providing an experience rivaling that of most current-gen AAA titles in both visuals and performance. Its open-world style and vast but not excessive cast of playable characters also set it apart as one of the most fun gacha games around for newcomers. On the other hand, its exploration-focused approach makes the game one of the most time-consuming picks on our list in the early and mid-game stages. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1. Honkai: Star Rail (PS5 / PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">A spin-off/sequel of <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em> but by all means its own game,<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Honkai: Star Rail </em></a>takes players on a journey across the universe. The game also mixes the exploration/character mechanics that made<em> Genshin Impact</em> such a success with an unbelievably polished turn-based combat system. Those looking for characters will also be pleased, as <em>Star Rail </em>features a roster of more than 40 unique ones. </p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><em>HSR’s</em> story is also praised for always delivering in the biggest moments and staying consistent. At the end of the day, <em>HSR </em>improves upon the best of its older siblings to deliver what I believe to be the best gacha experience currently available. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers 2</em> review bomb campaign players went on before <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-reviews-are-already-looking-better-after-sonys-backpedaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony reverted</a> the upcoming requirement for a PSN account login inadvertently created a great design for an in-game cape. Now, it looks like that cape may have been brought to life, and players can’t want to get it. </p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Over the past week or so, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have been through a pretty rough series of movements against and then for the game they love. When Sony indicated that a PSN account would be required to play from the end of May, players went on a review-bomb campaign until this requirement was rescinded. After that, a positive review-bombing campaign began, making a pretty interesting pattern on the game’s review stats page.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-arrowhead-reveals-helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-could-be-coming" data-injectable="false">Arrowhead reveals <em>Helldivers 2</em> review bomb cape could be coming</h2> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">Over the weekend, Arrowhead Game Studios’ CEO Johan Pilesedt shared a cheeky <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789410993119846721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of a cape</a> in <em>Helldivers 2</em> that looks suspiciously like the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-jokes-about-accidental-cape-design-from-negative-steam-reviews-and-players-want-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image that he joked</a> would make a great cape in the game. Players immediately jumped on the past and began begging to have it in their inventory.</p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">Users seemingly lost their minds when they saw this and posted amazing replies, like <a href="https://twitter.com/RealRifkin/status/1789407821068743152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basetrade’s comment</a>, “ID LIKE TO DOWNVOTE THIS POST BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY.” </p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">The cape would be the second to commemorate the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community. The first was the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-can-claim-a-special-commemorative-malevelon-creek-cape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malevelon Creek cape</a> that every player was given in recognition of the insane number of deaths on the planet and how much players hate fighting on it. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">This new cape could mean more, though. It recognizes the power of the community working together not just in the game but outside of it, too. The review bombing was a form of protest, as players aimed to force Sony to reverse its decision to require PC players to have a PSN account.</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">However, just because a cape may be on the way, it doesn’t mean the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community is done fighting. At the time of writing, 177 countries are unable to purchase the game after it was delisted from Steam. Those countries do not allow PSN accounts, meaning it was impossible for those users to play the game once the PSN requirement was instated. </p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">User G.O.A.T.Gaming replied to this same post, saying, “You promised everyone would be able to play Helldivers, and they can’t. We trusted you!” Pilestedt has explained in multiple social media posts that it would be in Sony’s hands to fix this, but Arrowhead Game Studios is hoping it will be resolved soon. </p>

However, there’s never been any concrete evidence or enemy unit to point a firearm at and kill. the last few days feel different, though, because the developer has been teasing the faction on Twitter in open conversations with fans. </p> <h2 id="h-pilestedt-is-throwing-around-illuminate-rumors-for-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">Pilestedt is throwing around Illuminate rumors for <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="blue laser illuminate in helldivers 2" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lifeless’ YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Arrowhead Game Studios’ CEO Johan Pilestedt has been hinting at the Illuminate from the original <em>Helldivers</em> game over the past couple of days. In response to a call for collaborations alongside a <a href="https://twitter.com/LoopyLewis1990/status/1789402287779004544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phenomenal video that showcases</a> a mod for <em>Helldivers 2</em> that brings <em>Star Wars</em> to the game, Pilestedt said, “Imagine if there was a predator-like alien species in the Helldivers universe that were exiled from the galaxy that were planning vengeance!”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine if there was a predator-like alien species in the Helldivers universe that were exiled from the galaxy that were planning vengeance! 🤔</p>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1789405330104836434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">This is exactly what the Illuminate is. Given their lack of presence in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, it’s assumed that they were eventually wiped out by Super Earth. At least their presence in the local galactic region. That would make them pretty damn cross, and I see them coming back swinging after they’ve licked their wounds a little. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had the craziest dream that this whole <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Helldivers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Helldivers</a> account linking controversy was revealed to be a marketing ploy by Arrowhead to announce the in-game arrival of the Illuminate, who are attempting to turn Helldivers against Super Earth via social-engineering psiops. It was WILD</p>— ThusKindly (@thus_kindly) <a href="https://twitter.com/thus_kindly/status/1788518071646187863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Pilestedt isn’t the only one with Illuminate on the brain, though. User ThusKindly on <a href="https://twitter.com/thus_kindly/status/1788518071646187863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter shared</a> what reads like a pretty harrowing dream in which it was revealed that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-reviews-are-already-looking-better-after-sonys-backpedaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN account link war</a> between <em>Helldivers 2</em> players and Sony was actually a marketing ploy with the new enemy faction as the surprise ending. </p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">But we’ve been down this road before. Previously, Arrowhead Game Studios was served with evidence of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-blue-laser-remarks-fuel-speculation-of-imminent-new-enemy-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blue lasers the Illuminate use</a> on the battlefield being caught in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. That was months ago, though, and the enemy faction hasn’t been seen since. While Pilestedt discussing the enemy doesn’t guarantee it’ll be added in the next update, it does make a story shakeup seem like it’s going to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, there’s a lovely space at the bottom of the galactic map where a new enemy faction would fit right in. It’s the perfect time for them to appear, too. Players are engaged in a grind to kill 2 billion Automatons for the current Major Order, meaning all of Super Earth’s attention is laser-focused on the top left-hand portion of the galaxy. Not the bottom. </p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The first two episodes of<em> Doctor Who</em> season 14, with Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, were released on May 12, and rather than the Doctor himself, everyone is talking about one character—Maestro. They’re one hell of a villain, but where have you seen that face before?</p> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">It seems that no matter where you look currently, you simply can’t avoid the face of Maestro. The musically talented villain is the undeniable star of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-who-could-be-the-one-who-waits/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjItNGQv4iGAxVTVPEDHXGuCjcQFnoECBYQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw36nDMu5hzpsMg2zdAe-0Ub">The Devil’s Chord</a>, the most recent episode of this season of <em>Doctor Who </em>so far, and they’re actually a pretty familiar face to some people.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">In the show, Maestro is hell-bent on their mission to rid the world of music and keep it for themselves, but in real life, the actor who plays them is as opposed to this idea as it gets.&nbsp;</p>

It’s safe to say that she’s got a serious amount of talent and is noted for her ability to perform off-the-cuff impersonations of celebrities. To date, she has released two studio albums (The Inevitable Album in 2014 and The Ginger Snapped in 2018), so if anyone was perfect for the role of Maestro, it would be her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">However, familiarity with Jinkx is more likely to come from her roles on television. While she doesn’t have an extensive acting career behind her, she was one of the featured drag queens on season five of <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race</em> back in 2013, winning the season. She came back to the show in 2022, when she took part in season seven of <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race All Stars</em>, going on to win that too and earning the title “The Queen of Queens”.&nbsp;</p>

She voice acted in an episode of <em>Steven Universe</em>, playing the main antagonist of the episode “ Lars of the Stars”, Emerald. She was also in an episode of <em>Blue Bloods</em>, playing Tallulah, as well as providing her voice as Normulon and Lemongrab in the gender-swapping <em>Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Dying Light (2015) is soaring on Steam amid a monumental sale that has slashed the game’s price tag down to single-digit dollars. This open-world zombie title, which is often considered one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, first wowed audiences almost a decade ago with its high-octane parkour mechanics and grisly combat engine.</p>



<p>As Techland has slashed the price to celebrate Zombie Awareness Month, tens of thousands of people have flooded into the game, boasting the player count by around 330%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undead-rising">Undead Rising</h2>



<p>On Steam, which has readily available player data, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/239140#6m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a peak player count of 39,812 players</a> was recorded in the last twenty-four hours. Last month, that peak player count sat at around 9,049. By contrast, 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released to a mixed reception, boasts a twenty-four-hour peak player count of around 7,000.</p>



<p>The all-time high for Dying Light on Steam is 45,770, so this special sale almost reached a new record. </p>



<p>For reference, the last time Dying Light scored anywhere close to these numbers on Steam was in February 2022 – when Dying Light 2 was released. Isn’t it funny how that works?</p>



<p>Dying Light is well worth playing, even almost a decade after it emerged. It features an immersive, entertaining story that’ll keep you occupied for a good thirty to fifty hours, and there’s a fantastic option for multiplayer if you want to slay the undead alongside a friend. It was one of the defining games of the last generation and one of the best zombie games ever made, so it’s well worth paying a couple of dollars to get ahold of it.</p>

            <p>Fan-favourite WWE fighter CM Punk is returning to WWE 2K24 for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>Punk marks his return as part of the ECW Punk Pack alongside Terry Funk, Sandman, and The Dudley Boyz, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley.</p>

<p>Players can also expect MyFaction Content which includes an ECW Paul Heyman Manager Card and unspecified MyFaction Superstar Cards when the pack drops on 15th May for all platforms.</p>
<p>You can see a brief snippet of the action in the teaser below:</p> 
<p>Don't forget that the Post Malone and Friends pack – containing Post, Sensational Sherri, Mosh, Thrasher, Honky Tonk Man, and Jimmy Hart Manager – will follow in June and the Pat McAfee Pack is slated to release in July.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-u-turns-on-modder-ban-following-community-backlash">WWE 2K24 recently unbanned a prolific WWE modder following complaints from its community</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsTheStatus - who was banned last week for "violation of terms" - revealed on Twitter/X that, after speaking with 2K and the WWE team, they had "come to an agreement, and a fair one at that". Originally, 2K and/or developer Visual Concepts was unhappy with WhatsTheStatus' mods, saying that as they "negatively impact the game experience for other players", the modder was banned in order to ensure there is a "positive WWE 2K24 experience for all players".</p>
