            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yoko Taro, creator of Nier: Automata and one of the most prolific developers currently working in video games today, has, contrary to what many fans believe, been working on several video game projects since the release of Nier: Automata in 2017. We've just not been able to see any of the work he's been doing, because the projects he's been on have been cancelled before they made it to public viewing.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/">4Gamer</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">Automaton</a>), Yoko Taro set the story straight on what has become a sort of joke amongst his fans that he's not been working on games in recent years. He clarified that he's worked on several projects, though for reasons he did not or could not specify, they were cancelled before they could see the light of day.</p>



<p>"<em>I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren't you making a new sequel to NeiR' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released</em>."</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate, though unsurprising, reality of the modern video game industry that even a developer like Yoko Taro can be working in the industry for years and have nothing to show for it because the game never made it to launch and most unrevealed projects are locked behind NDA's and mountains of red tape that make it appear to the outside observer that you've been doing nothing for the better part of a decade.</p>



<p>He further clarifies that he doesn't feel negatively about the fact that he's not had a shipped game in years, and instead implies that he'd rather not put anything out if it's not going to be exactly right. "<em>I don't view that as a negative thing</em>," he continued. "<em>I believe that if I'm going to release something weird, I'd be better off not releasing anything at all.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-series-creator-yoko-taro-two-games-unsettling/">that we've had multiple reports</a> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-is-working-on-a-game-that-might-or-might-not-be-nier/">recent years regarding projects</a> Yoko Taro is working on. Now, it could be that some of those projects are the cancelled ones to which he refers to here, but regardless, it seems like Yoko Taro felt strongly enough about the idea that he's been sitting on his hands for years that he felt the need to explain why we've not seen anything he's worked on recently.</p>



<p>It seems like we'll just have to continue being patient and hope that at least one of the things he's working on will make it into the hands of players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deadpool-vr-review-merc-with-headset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadpool-vr-review-the-merc-with-the-headset.1355929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got a taste of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d21d65a5-4b5d-4746-8132-7a248cc992b2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deadpool-vr-pushes-vr-automotion-while-creating-fun-and-frantic-experience" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool VR</em> earlier this year at Summer Game Fest</a>, and I was blown away. I'm no stranger to VR, but the kinds of rhythm games and small tech demos that I was used to when I first got my Vive ~10 years ago were a far cry from the improved movement, responsive controls, and entertaining plot as you shoot and slash your way through the Helicarrier as Deadpool. Having played it now for an additional 10 hours, does it still retain that charm?</p>

<p>In <em>Deadpool VR</em>, you take up the mantle of the Merc with a Mouth, this time voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. As Deadpool, you're initially hired to infiltrate a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier whose operation has been taken over by Flag Smasher. Making your way through the corridors, you're taught how to be the best mercenary you can while building a witty rapport with the different characters that are talking to you over voice comms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flagsmasher.jpg?itok=Vl4UdWrI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flagsmasher.jpg?itok=glSOvE2x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Be prepared to be a head on the ground a number of times</figcaption></figure><p>Near the conclusion of your battle with Flag Smasher, the true plot of the game is revealed as you're yanked through space and time and deposited into the lobby of Mojo TV. Here, you're hired (forced) to work for Mojo, building up ratings for his hyper-violent survival TV show by going out to recruit other contestants from across the Marvel multiverse. Characters include Lady Deathstroke, Omega Red, and Ultimo.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from anything Deadpool, the game is filled to the brim with crass jokes, witty one-liners, and fourth wall breaks. You'll get to hear Deadpool call himself Marvel Jesus, joke about a variety of inappropriate sex acts, and wish absurd violence on anyone who crosses his path. Honestly, there are not a lot of actors that I feel could get away with this level of crude verbal diarrhea, but Neil Patrick Harris absolutely nails the delivery of every line.</p>

<p>The only places that I really felt like the storyline could have been sped up or made a bit more snappy would be in the stand-still cutscenes. If a cutscene is playing on my TV with a traditional video game, I can just relax and watch. In VR, you're just awkwardly stuck there, standing still and waiting to get back to the action. A bit of walking and talking could have certainly tightened up aspects of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-one-piece.jpg?itok=od892gYl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-one-piece.jpg?itok=knnqdBXp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm always down for a One Piece joke, I just wish I could be doing something more than standing here...</figcaption></figure><p>The repeated combat dialogue is really the only place that Deadpool's chattering got a bit frustrating, but there's only so many times you can hear Deadpool make a decapitation quip before you begin to roll your eyes.</p>

<p>Overall, I was impressed with the story, it wasn't some grand epic, but it was a good way to pair Deadpool up with another interdimensional character like Mojo and give a good reason to drop Deadpool into a variety of unique settings like Ninja Temple or The Moon.</p>

<h2>Precise Shooting, But Flailing Sword Swings</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is a hack-and-slash where you'll start in Mojo's hub world, pick a different stage to make your way through different themed rooms and corridors as you defeat a variety of nameless henchmen before taking on their boss to recruit (kidnap) them for Mojo TV.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-prologue-gameplay.jpg?itok=zYBNJ-8a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-prologue-gameplay.jpg?itok=oMn4gfgr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Your base loadout includes two pistols that are strapped to your digital thighs, swords strapped to your back that you can grab over your shoulder, and a grapple gun in the small of your back. For the moments you needed it, a grenade is also strapped to your left forearm.</p>

<p>I absolutely loved the way you accessed your inventory. As you're making your way through frantic waves of enemies or platforming challenges, each weapon having a unique point to draw from minimizes interaction issues and creates less of a gap between the player and Deadpool. There are no finicky menus to worry about or selecting from multitudes of weapons, just a quick reach or drop of a weapon to be ready to continue attacking.</p>

<p>The guns, and by extension other ranged weapons like Playing Cards or Bows, are a lot of fun to play with. The swords are a bit more frantic to use. With somewhat floaty movement, trying to stay in melee range with an enemy can be a bit difficult. You'll quickly find that the most effective way to use these swords is just by flailing your arms around while running in a circle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Deadpool VR</em> does a lot to make you feel cool while playing, but swordplay is not one of those times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can temporarily get your hands on more powerful weapons by defeating the enemies that wield them in battle. These weapons are more powerful, like shotguns or SMGs, but they have limited ammunition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-melee-combat.jpg?itok=KLuHY54b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-melee-combat.jpg?itok=BR8WQlcs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Waggling my hands like my life depends on it</figcaption></figure><p>This can prompt you to quickly move through them, trying to maximize killing enemies and continuously swapping out your weapons, but they can also be reloaded by throwing them and having them ricochet off enemies.</p>

<p>This interaction creates a unique opportunity to link together combos while mowing through enemies. You might be sprinting forward, shooting at an enemy, and finish them off by bouncing a shotgun off their face, before taking it back into your hand, starting on the next enemy.</p>

<p>There are some fantastic object interactions that you'll get to experience by experimenting with weapons. One of my favorites in Lady Deathstroke's levels is that after defeating a ninja, they'll leave two floating kunai daggers. You can pick these up and use them yourself, or if you have your sword handy, you can slash at them to send them flying towards nearby enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-bouncing-weapons.jpg?itok=1gAu_EVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-bouncing-weapons.jpg?itok=UN2z9bNJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ricochet special weapons to reload them</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of help with magnetism that the game does to ensure a wild swing or thrown projectile hits it's target. You can tell the game is being nice to you, but you still feel like a badass while doing it, so I'll allow it.</p>

<p>The boss fights in <em>Deadpool VR</em> are, unfortunately, some of the weakest aspects. Each boss will sit back and take your gunfire or swordslashes while moving towards or away from you with a few very clearly telegraphed attacks.</p>

<p>There's an arcadey feel to fighting off the different waves of henchment enemies, trying to find the best line to completion or flashiest way to get the kills, but the boss fights are a bit more bullet sponger and basic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flag-smasher-qte.jpg?itok=HRAJP0Lb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flag-smasher-qte.jpg?itok=1PSA4RHD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Press F to throw a katana into Flag Smasher</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite part of any of the boss fights was ironically the QTE moments, where a silhouette of a target or a sword position might show in your field of view. Here, the player gets to react in slow motion to more complicated combos. This reactive dance is one of the only times an enemy will really react to the different weapons you use.</p>

<h2>Upgrades And Replayability</h2>

<p>The weapons listed above aren't the only ones that you'll get access to as you progress through <em>Deadpool VR</em>. You aren't just trying to recruit new fighters to Mojo TV, but are also its star, as you'll gain viewers and earn money for killing competently.</p>

<p>More viewers mean more money, and more money means you can purchase a variety of upgrades.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-sword-upgrades_0.jpg?itok=_cZ9xUs8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-sword-upgrades_0.jpg?itok=2xkEAXyH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Doesn't change much gameplay wise, but it looks cooler</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay upgrades include getting access to a variety of different weapons to augment your loadout. That might just mean that you get three grenades instead of one, or your guns are now a shiny new color. It can also mean you have different-bladed weapons or guns altogether.</p>

<p>On top of mechanical changes, there are also a variety of cosmetic options for Deadpool himself to pick from. Different themed outfits from Deadpools across the multiverse will unlock as you complete additional stages. After getting certain outfits, you can also return to different places in earlier stages that are themed to that character to open secret doors and get access to hidden content.</p>

<p>There is a lot of replayability that's built into this game, and a lot that I'm interested in checking out, but the length of the levels is also a bit of a detractor to this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-collectibles.jpg?itok=eUtnL7HE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-collectibles.jpg?itok=vlcqa_9H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Deadpool comics can be found hidden around the world</figcaption></figure><p>Even when I was playing the game at SGF and tried to scan my hand on a Lady Deadpool doorway in the Helicarier, only to be told you can access that in the full game, I was interested to see what's behind the door, but when getting to a secret door in a level might be a 20-30 minute endeavor it makes it a bit harder to push for.</p>

<p>I feel that if the game had broken up the different missions into smaller chunks with checkpoints to quickly hop to, or just had more levels that were shorter, this kind of replayability would feel more like a detour, instead of an additional adventure like it currently feels.</p>

<h2>The Look And Feel Of A Comic Book World</h2>

<p>One thing that I was truly blown away with, especially after only really interacting with PC VR and Mobile Phone VR, was how great a VR game looked on a standalone system.</p>

<p>Another thing helping this is the comic book style of the world, filled with rich and saturated colors and heavy outlines. Many of the characters and locations felt like they were pulled straight from the pages of a comic book or from a Saturday Morning Cartoon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-combat-score.jpg?itok=7feGGDcB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-combat-score.jpg?itok=gj2ODJlZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New high score!</figcaption></figure><h2>Marvel's <em>Deadpool VR</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Deadpool VR</em> at SGF I thoroughly enjoyed my time from the tight gameplay (maybe not so much the swordplay) to the witty and fast-paced dialogue. Having spent somewhere between 30-60 minutes on the game, I couldn't help but think as I was walking away, "Will this still be fun after 4-5 hours?"</p>

<p>I'm very happy to announce that it totally is.</p>

<p><em>Marvel's Deadpool VR</em> takes a pretty traditional level-based hack and slash and puts you in the middle of it. Leaning into some of the stranger aspects of the Marvel universe, like Mojo, this game delivers a Marvel experience filled with fast-paced combat and plenty of chuckles.</p>

<p>Melee combat is still something that needs to be worked on, but without a weight in your hand and resistance to swing against, I believe that's always going to be something near impossible to replicate.</p>

<p>If you have a Quest 3, this should be your next jaunt through Virtual Reality, whether it's on your own or something to share with friends and pass and play, trying for the most impressive kills.</p>

I’m not talking about microSD cards, which are convenient, but slow. I’m talking about M.2 2230-size SSDs that are significantly faster at reading and writing data. If so, Prime members can run over to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D61SDZD2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> to grab <strong>Crucial’s P310 2TB SSD </strong>while it’s $123.49. It’s just $2 more than its lowest price yet. 1TB SSDs in this form factor usually cost around $80 to $100, depending on the brand, so doubling the storage is a great value. Despite being available for months at around $150, it has recently sold at its original asking price of $239.99.</p><p>The process for upgrading your handheld’s SSD differs depending on the model, and in case you weren’t aware, it involves opening up your handheld. So there’s some challenge and inherent risks of damaging its internals with this process if you aren’t patient. If I was doing this process myself, I’d consult guides at iFixit. Even when equipped with the best guides, it’s possible you may not have the right tools to get the job done. If that’s the case, grabbing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0189YWOIO/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">iFixit’s basic 64-bit set for $39.99</a> should be a great companion for this and other tech tinker tasks.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Last week, we covered an early Black Friday deal on <strong>Meta’s Quest 3S entry-level virtual reality headset</strong>.

            <p>
Is this what life is now? Witnessing massive, incredibly successful companies turning to AI to get advice on legal proceedings? You don't need to pinch me, I've already done it, and this world is real. The company in question here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publisher Krafton, who you might remember are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">being sued by three ex-leads of the game</a>; developer of the game Unknown Worlds are (technically) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">also suing this trio of developers in kind</a>. This all came about because Krafton delayed Subnautica 2, a decision that meant Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">wouldn't get a $250 million bonus</a>. And it seems that the publisher even asked ever-reliable ChatGPT for advice on how they could avoid doing just that.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a copy of a pre-trial briefing seen by <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-chatgpt-2000644792">Kotaku</a> that was filed on behalf of those three ex-leads, Unknown founders Charles Cleveland, Adam "Max" McGuire, and Edward "Ted" Gill. The group's filing claims that "Krafton terminated the Founders and seized control of Unknown Worlds in order to avoid the earnout. Smoking gun documents show that Krafton was looking for ways to “cancel the earn-out” and that its secret 'Project X' was designed to either make a 'Deal' on the earnout or execute a 'Take over.' When the Founders would not agree to Krafton’s demands related to the earnout, Krafton decided a 'take over' would be the “easier” route."
</p>
<p>
A snippet of what appears to be a conversation between Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han and head of global operations Richard Yoon, with the latter making direct reference to enacting a take over. 
</p>
<p>
This filing also makes the claim that Krafton felt it had overpaid for Unknown Worlds, which led to them wanting to avoid the $250 million payout. So, to figure out a way to not do that, they seemingly turned to ChatGPT for help, with the filing explaining that "Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be ‘difficult to cancel the earn-out.'" The Unknown Worlds co-founders also say that Krafton wouldn't produce evidence of these ChatGPT conversations, and "when pressed, confirmed that they no longer exist."
</p><p>
I am not an expert in AI, even if I am a hater of it, but I feel that if I were in the same position as Krafton, as a massive publisher with some money to spare, and I really didn't want to give someone $250 million, I would not rely on a famously unreliable AI chatbot (I was being sarcastic earlier when I called it reliable, FYI). But that's just me!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm sure that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-and-inzoi-publishers-announce-voluntary-layoff-program-amid-the-era-of-ai-transformation">voluntary redundancy program </a>Krafton have begun as part of a bid to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company">prioritise the use of generative AI in game development</a> is going to go really well for the industry.

            <p>I started a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl</a> run this past weekend, and like most of my decisions, I now look back on it with pain and regret. Had I waited just a couple more days, I could have begun anew with the roaming FPS's new Expedition update, which is out now and spans everything from difficulty modes and inventory tweaks to enemy behaviour reworks and yet more upgrades to its A-Life simulation system.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Expedition, a.k.a. Update 1.7, is detailed in full over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993">Steam</a>. I consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a>’s Zone to be brutish enough that I likely won’t be braving its new Master difficulty, though the Expedition modifier – which can be applied on new games at lower difficulties – sounds interesting. It limits your saves and forces you to hang out with guitar-strumming fellow stalkers at camps in order to record your progress, a twist that brings back (mostly) fond memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>’s Hardcore mode. Though in a clear oversight, you can’t cover Stalker 2’s map in improvised bedrolls just to create a web of sleep-operated savepoints.</p> <figure>

<p>Meanwhile! GSC Game World, in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">ongoing quest</a> to build a society of persistently simulated gopniks, has refined how their A-Life system handles faction territories. The Zone’s various militias can now cede ground if they lose the wrong fights in the wrong places, and mutants – who have lairs of their own – will get involved in these border wars as well. Outdoor gunfights may also, to quote the patch notes, "feel fair at last", as baddies will no longer possess perfect sight through bushes, tall grass, and reeds. Sneakier Skifs can, thus, hide in the veg to evade or ambush passing goons – a marked development for Stalker 2’s otherwise limited stealth play.</p>
<p>Other highlights include an Immersion Mode that instantly switches off the HUD, a couple of new (if relatively non-murderous) anomalies to stumble into, and a light rejigging of the inventory screen that adds some extra detail to item stats and status effects. I also enjoy how knocking back energy drinks like an embittered Twitch streamer will now induce an aim-ruining tremor; perhaps it’s those health freaks at GSC Game World encouraging you to drink water instead. There’s a bunch of bug fixes and minor performance optimisations too.</p><p>I’d say there’s enough here to restart my restarted playthrough, thankfully <em>and</em> annoyingly, though in my heart of hearts I was never in the wait-for-updates camp to begin with. I found Stalker 2 an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">enthralling wandering sim</a> from the off, so thick with eerie, post-apocalyptic atmosphere that you could reach out and pull handfuls of radioactive muck from it. And that’s a hard thing to pull off, especially when your country is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">invaded by a dictatorial petrostate</a>, or someone is trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/misery-devs-claim-theyve-resolved-misunderstanding-with-stalker-studio-gsc-game-world-as-shooter-returns-to-steam">pinch your helicopter models</a>.</p>

              <p>Surprise! Xbox has announced a new digital event that will broadcast later this week and will provide a new look at <em>007 First Light</em> as well as some “brand-new reveals” and Game Pass announcements, too.</p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/">On November 17,</a> Microsoft announced the next Xbox Partner Preview, a digital broadcast that the company says “shines a light on upcoming games” from various third-party studios. Beyond a new trailer for IOI’s upcoming<em> 007</em> game, Xbox promises new footage of horror adventure game <em>Reanimal</em> and an extended look at gameplay from<em> Tides of Annihilation.</em> Xbox also promises more info about the games revealed in the showcase on the company’s blog, Xbox Wire.</p> <p>The event will begin on Thursday, November 20, at 10 am PST / 1 pm EST. And you can watch it on <a href="https://youtube.com/Xbox">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://tiktok.com/@Xbox">TikTok</a>. The YouTube stream will be broadcast in 4K/60, which is always nice.</p> <p>“Xbox Partner Preview is all about bringing you news from our partners across the globe,” said Xbox in a press release. “Be it release date announcements, fresh new gameplay from upcoming titles, and world premieres of unannounced new games. We’re also excited to reveal that Jennifer English, who portrays <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> protagonist Gwendolyn, is our voiceover artist for the show.”</p> <p>All of the games confirmed to show up in the Thursday event, as well as the new reveals teased in the announcement post, will all be Xbox Play Anywhere, so you can buy the game once and play it on Xbox, PC, and devices that support cloud streaming, with your save games and progress seamlessly hopping from machine to machine. This is a very nifty feature that I use a lot, and I’m happy to see more third-party devs and publishers embracing it. I hope &lt;INSERT GAME YOU ARE EXCITED ABOUT HERE&gt; is finally revealed or announced after the long wait. Good luck!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-rumors-leak-fake-news-false-capcom-2000644833</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-producer-calls-leon-rumors-%E2%80%98fake-news-%E2%80%99-but-fans-still-believe.1355905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will Leon S. Kennedy and his glorious hair appear in the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>? He totally will, according to many fans. But officially, Capcom hasn’t confirmed it, and <em>Requiem’s</em> producer has even called the rumors “fake news,” but spoke just vaguely enough that fans will likely continue to believe in this popular online theory.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">Almost immediately after <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> was revealed in June</a>, fans began theorizing that the survival horror sequel is secretly hiding another playable character: Leon. Officially,<em> Requiem</em> features only one playable character, Grace Ashcroft, and is a return to the slower, creepier horror found in past entries.</p>

 <p>Playable in either third or first person, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is set to launch in February for consoles and PC, and many fans believe that when it does, Leon will at the very least show up or might even be a playable character. As evidence, they point to the fact that, since being announced, we’ve seen very little of the game beyond a few sections. Some suggest this confirms that you’ll play as Leon in other parts of the game. A leaked image of a grizzled Leon wearing an eyepatch adds more fuel to the fire. And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">Capcom has been oddly coy</a> about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon when asked in past interviews</a>. But according to the game’s producer, there’s no concrete basis for fans to believe that Leon will be in the game.</p>

 <p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players],” said <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in"><em>Reqeuim</em> producer Masato Kumazawa in a new interview</a> with <em>Stevivor.&nbsp;</em> “So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value.”</p>

 <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">“Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation.”</p>

 <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Kumazawa also directly addressed the “leaked” eyepatch image, and it’s not good news for fans who liked the redesign.</p> <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">“There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p> <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">However, Kumazawa never says directly that Leon <em>isn’t</em> in the game. Instead, his answer essentially boils down to him saying that it all just amounts to speculation and telling people to only trust information from Capcom. So if you’re still holding out hope that Leon is in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, this interview doesn’t negate the possibility that the famous character could pop up. It just seems that if he does, he’ll have both eyes intact. <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> launches on February 27, 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

              <p>It’s award season for video games, and that means it’s time to gear up for another hours-long commercial with some awards sprinkled in between the new trailers. The Game Awards is back this year and will be streaming live on December 11. Today, November 17, host Geoff Keighley will be announcing this year’s nominees, which are decided by a panel of different critics, journalists, and other industry figures.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-doubles-down-on-next-gen-console-and-calls-it-a-%E2%80%98powerful-experience%E2%80%99.1355899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent video published by Fortune, Xbox President Sarah Bond spoke about the next-generation Xbox console, which has long been a point of debate and contention amongst gamers. Some believe Xbox is <strong>getting out of hardware</strong>, while die-hard fans are fully preparing to stump up the cash for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>Sarah Bond insists that the next Xbox will offer a ‘powerful experience’ that will be portable and accessible across multiple platforms, going with players ‘everywhere they go’.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-xbox-has-big-promises-in-store">The Next Xbox Has Big Promises in Store</h2>



<p>The team at Xbox recently confirmed a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-confirmed-for-this-week/">Partner Preview event</a>, scheduled to drop later this week. This is where upcoming games will be showcased, particularly those that have a tie-in with Xbox in some way. To that end, we know that the likes of Tencent, IO Interactive, and THQ Nordic will show up at the event.</p>



<p>Beyond the games, Xbox is still looking to whatever hardware comes next. It might be a good couple of years before it surfaces, but the next-generation Xbox is shaping up to be something special, if the likes of Sarah Bond are to be believed.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Fortune, Bond explained what’s happening with the future of hardware at the Microsoft-backed gaming firm:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, <strong>love </strong>the hardware experience. That’s why we’re working on our next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to play it on PC or stream it on the Cloud.</p>



<p>And so, the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It sounded pretty scripted, but that’s part and parcel of being the most prolific spokesperson in the company (perhaps on par with Phil Spencer, of course). The way Bond kept repeating ‘Xbox Experience’ has me thinking that the next console already has a name picked out… (shifty eyes emoji).</p>



<p>What do you think the next Xbox will look like? How will it serve you as a gamer? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Brendan Greene, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>, better known by his alias PlayerUnknown, has said he's "heartened" to see see people rally against the use of generative AI when used to make games.</p>
<p>His comments came while responding to questions about whether his studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, uses generative AI to power the world-generating technology it's currently working on, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-you-know-brendan-playerunknown-greene-the-creator-of-pubg-wants-to-remake-the-internet">he one day hopes will generate Earth-sized planets that millions of people can play on</a>.</p>
<p>"We don't use LLMs [large language models] so I'm not super worried [about backlash]," Greene told me. "LLMS have their uses, but there were chatbots in the 60s and 70s that achieved a lot of similar things. So I'm not super worried there. The systems we're building are to enable the artists to sculpt the worlds how they want. It's like an orchestra: we can be either a violin player or we can be the conductor, where you know what everything does, and you just have some levers you can pull and it creates worlds pretty quickly.</p>
<p>"I've been really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff," he added. "It's good to see that gamers go: 'No - if it's not built by artists, I don't want to see it.' So that's been really great to see. So I'm not super worried, because I think we're using it in the right way. I think we're using it in a way that enables you to create worlds quicker, rather than taking away the jobs of artists."</p>
<blockquote><em>"It's good to see that gamers go: 'No - if it's not built by artists, I don't want to see it"</em></blockquote>
<p>Greene's remarks take on an additional edge given the links his studio has to Krafton, the South Korean company that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">controversially announced a company-wide 'AI first' mandate and entered a voluntary redundancy period</a> recently where anyone who didn't want to be a part of it could get out. PlayerUnknown Productions began life as a Krafton 'special projects' team that Greene set up after leaving the PUBG project in 2019.</p>
<p>"What we got up to in special projects was the first parts of what we're doing now in this three-game plan," he explained to me. "So that was the start of PlayerUnknown Productions and then after a few years, I asked to go out on my own and they supported me, and we birthed PlayerUnknown Productions."</p>
<p>The key piece of information there is "they supported me" because Krafton remains an investor in PlayerUnknown Productions today. And why would Krafton invest in a studio and technology if it didn't align with its future goals?</p>

<p>"As a fully independent studio, our overall goals at PlayerUnknown Productions are not influenced by Krafton's chosen strategy," Greene told me in a follow-up email after our call. "While Krafton remains a minority stakeholder in our studio, their internal operations are separate from ours since 2021.</p>
<p>"Project Artemis and our three-game plan are being developed independently by us and we have been working on our plans for some time now.</p>
<p>"While we are doing technological research into areas like machine learning to give our artists tools to generate worlds at greater scale using local GPU compute, our focus is on using technology to solve problems of scale for players to enjoy bigger and more emergent worlds."</p>
<blockquote><em>"Our overall goals at PlayerUnknown Productions are not influenced by Krafton's chosen strategy"</em></blockquote>
<p>The three-game plan he mentioned is already significantly under way. Game-one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-about-to-release-his-next-game-and-its-not-what-youre-expecting-at-all">Prologue: Go Wayback!, launches in early access on 20th November</a>. It's a survival and orienteering game about weathering the elements and finding your way through a forested wilderness, while not starving or freezing or otherwise dying in a variety of ways. But really it's a demonstration of terrain-level world generation. In a minute or so the game builds a unique and detailed world for you to play in, and it does this every time you play.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-planning-a-new-multiplayer-fps">The second game PlayerUnknown Productions is making will be a multiplayer shooter,</a> which will be an exciting return to a genre Greene had colossal success in with PUBG. The game after that, game three, will introduce yet more layers and tools to the underpinning technology to get it to a point other people can use it in. And the idea is to release it for free as open source technology.</p>

            <p>Wow, it's hard to believe it's been 20 years since the Xbox 360 released and gave the games industry a proper shake-up. With SEGA gone as a platform holder and Nintendo floundering as Sony seized power, Xbox took its opportunity to get the jump on PlayStation, releasing the Xbox 360 as the first console of that generation a year before the PS3 (and in some territories, that gap was even bigger). And it worked. Xbox 360 got off to a flying start, backed by some brilliant exclusive games and an industry leading online multiplayer offering.</p>
<p>Things weren't always smooth (Red Ring of Death anyone?), but by and large the Xbox 360 is remembered with a large degree of fondness by anyone who owned one. A console that took the fight to Sony and almost came away victorious.</p>
<p>This week we've got loads of Xbox 360 coverage for you to read, looking at some of the key games, our own memories, and a special chat with the man many people picture when the Xbox 360 is brought up. Maybe one of us should have gotten a tattoo of his face as a bit of promotional work? Damn, I have all the good ideas too late.</p>
<p>Head over to our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox360at20">Xbox 360 20th anniversary hub</a> for all the articles as they go live.</p>

<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160589/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/indika">Indika</a> I’d call one of the most singularly audacious narrative exploration games in recent memory, a daring title that defies easy classification with its surrealist flourishes, cinematic art direction, and cynical inversion of familiar video game mechanics. Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch version isn’t it.</p>
<p>Part spiritual tragicomedy, part psychological fever-dream, developers Odd Meter deliver what is essentially a playable crisis of faith, one shackled to a deeply compromised port so crash-prone and visually mangled at times that it’s very hard to recommend in its current state, even as the story underneath it all is nothing short of compelling.</p>
<p>Between missing assets, localisation glitches, heavily compromised cutscene quality, and repeated crashes, this port undermines the very things that make Indika special. Indeed, you could be forgiven for wanting to brute-force your way through its five-hour runtime despite its performance issues just to see this heady, thought-provoking tale through to its conclusion.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game puts you in control of Indika, a meek young nun eking out a bleak existence in a frigid Tsarist-era Russian convent. She’s loathed by the other sisters and treated like a workhorse. As you mundanely haul potatoes and fetch water, a sardonic disembodied voice begins to chime in, one that the game’s own marketing nudges you to interpret as the devil himself.</p>
<p>Whether this force — a tormentor and commentator who pries at her doubts, teasing her with sexual temptation and needling the hollowness of her performative piety — is a literal demon or simply her own intrusive thoughts is left to you to decide. In any case, Indika’s spiritual reckoning eschews shallow blasphemy for its own sake and has real philosophical heft.</p>
<p>The game’s writing is sharper than you might initially expect, with characters that would not be out of place in a Dostoyevsky novel pondering the uneasy nature of free will, the hierarchies of sin, and the mysteries of the human soul. Indika likewise revels in weaponising tedious gameplay as a punchline in its critique of the structures that shape belief itself.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160583/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moment-to-moment play involves light environmental puzzles that are rarely challenging. You’ll push a safe on wheels to tilt a crumbling building so a piano slides into position beneath a window to create a path, operate machinery in a fish factory and other industrial locales, and manipulate walkways by holding the prayer button to make bridges appear or vanish.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of flashback sequences rendered in pixel art that function as playable memories of Indika’s life before the convent. These segments include minigame challenges that range from isometric bike racing and small platforming challenges in a 'repeat until you get the timing right' format. But the controls don’t feel intuitive and take a moment to adjust to.</p>
<p>These sections are the most overtly video-gamey parts of Indika, and the tonal whiplash between the colourful, retro-styled recollections and solemn 3D hyper-realism of the main campaign and its staid 'walking simulator' segments — slow back and forth traversal between a well and a crate, turning a wheezing crank with an awkward analogue rotation — are by design.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160588/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Layered on top of this is a deliberately useless skill tree that levels up shame, grief, guilt, repentance, and so on with points gained from pious things such as lighting candles to illuminate religious icons, finding relics, and dutifully completing chores. At one point, the game straight-up tells you not to bother collecting points because they’re <em>pointless</em>.</p>
<p>No one who plays Indika will rave about its gameplay, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying being in its world. As you trek between convent, village, and industrial sites, you hear snow crunch underfoot, howling wind, distant gunshots, and a woman sobbing somewhere out of sight. Interiors of abandoned peasant homes are richly detailed, illuminated in flickering candlelight.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is strikingly anachronistic, weaving lo-fi electronic ambience with flashes of club-tinged breakbeats and synth textures that collide with droning Orthodox chant. There are voiceovers in both British English and Russian. Playing with a Russian voiceover and English subtitles felt like the more immersive option to me, though both languages are well-performed.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160581/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, if you have access to another platform, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/indika">play it there</a>. Whether running on original Switch hardware or a Switch 2, this version is simply a mess. Across my playthrough, I experienced four hard crashes that would sometimes dump me back at the start of a level, and the game often reloaded in a broken state where your companion character and their dialogue would fail to spawn, leaving only their subtitles on screen.</p>
<p>There were also sections where subtitles failed to show up entirely. Scenes that previously featured music would reload in total silence while NPCs continued to dance. Between transitions from gameplay to cutscenes, the screen would consistently flash odd glitch frames for a split second; this was not intentional stylisation but a persistent artifacting error.</p>
<p>Visually, the Switch version is seriously compromised, and comparing key scenes to footage from other versions is disheartening. During standard gameplay, environments are serviceable if a little soft, but the cutscenes — crucial for a game this cinematic — often look like a smudged and muddy PS2 game. There are entire visual motifs that are entirely lost on Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="Indika Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160591/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game pixelates shadows during a certain intimate moment in a callback to Indika’s past, but this could barely be discerned due to the poor resolution and contrast. In at least one sequence, the lighting was so dark on Switch that a major visual beat initially went unnoticed. Elsewhere, over-bright lighting makes an unsettling character close-up suffer badly.</p>
<p>Visuals take an even more dramatic hit in handheld mode with a <em>significant</em> drop in fidelity that’s hard to overlook. The handheld image is so soft and low-res that environmental details smear into indistinct muddy gradients, leaving scenes that often resemble an early-2000s game struggling under heavy post-processing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s a shame that a game as idiosyncratic and thematically dense as Indika arrives on Switch in such a dire state. Its story and ideas linger long after the credits, offering plenty to reflect on. Still, this version is marred at every turn by technical shortcomings and visual compromises that diminish the impact of an experience that deserves far better.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Digital Sun has returned to deliver <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, the anticipated sequel to their 2018 action RPG roguelike, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>, which launches into Early Access for PC via Steam, PC Game Pass, and the Microsoft Store. The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">intended to release <em>Moonlighter 2</em> on 23rd October 2025</a>; however, due to a plethora of great gaming releases that month, the developer moved its release to November.</p>

<p>According to the developer, the game is expected to release its full version for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">all platforms, including consoles</a>, at a date to be announced at a later time. But for the time being, we get to enjoy our time as a relic shopkeeper named Will, who has to make his way in a distant village and earn coin to his name while uncovering secrets about an ancient artifact that appeared in Tresna.</p>

<h2>All Hands Back On Deck At The Moonlighter</h2>

<p>Players who have yet to be introduced to the <em>Moonlighter</em> series, the first game took place in Rynoka, where they followed a young orphaned boy, Will, who set off on an adventure by exploring various dungeons located near his home. Exploring these dungeons allowed Will to acquire relics of different rarities, which he brought back to his family shop called the Moonlighter; however, one such discovery was a corpse with a peculiar note suggesting that there are four keys to be acquired from four guardians.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=ze3hfCnm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=s8S90mO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't worry if you haven't played Moonlighter as the opening scene for Moonlighter 2 recounts the events from the first game!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>After collecting those keys, unlocking the final dungeon, discovering interdimensional shenanigans, and encountering a government organization, Will returns home with the news of no longer being able to explore these dungeons again. This is where the sequel, <em>The Endless Vault,</em> picks up the story as Will finds himself in a new location, the vibrant village of Tresna, with new and familiar allies to be acquainted with and dungeons to explore.</p>

<p>As for the story, well, Will and a few other villagers have found themselves stranded in Tresna due to ongoing events in Rynoka, which are preventing them from returning home, and Will can learn more about them by accepting quests and progressing with the game itself! But as we're starting over with no coin to our name, it's back to business as we must discover and clear dungeons to seek our priceless relics to sell in our little shop (yes, The Moonlighter shop is back)!</p>

<p>Aside from exploring and clearing dungeons, finding precious treasures, and selling them in their shop, Will will be given opportunities to upgrade his weapons, armor, and perks, and acquire stunning pieces of furniture and decor items for the shop. Then there's the mysterious appearance of an ancient artifact, known only as The Endless Vault, providing a unique set of challenges and rewards for Will to take on.</p>

<p>Progress through the game in its opening hours to learn that it provides Will with a series of challenges, and after meeting its requirements, it will offer a reward and continue with these challenges for higher rewards. This reward will be valuable, especially as it can help boost the town's prosperity through upgrades that not only increase the town's morale but also enhance the wealth to be shared among the villagers.</p>

<h2>Battling Upon The Heat Of The Dungeons</h2>

<p>Once again, we'll remind players that the game is launching in Early Access, so technical issues, bugs, and glitches are to be expected during this period, as the developer will continue working on the game right up until its eventual full release. Nevertheless, in terms of gameplay, there aren't many differences between <em>Moonlighter</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>; however, both games stand out in offering unique and refreshing takes on the action RPG roguelike genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=1lC-ohLW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=6VrPop9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players (and Will) are sure to encounter some unique enemies and mini bosses during the dungeon run so be on the alert!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of <em>Moonlighter 2</em> is the quest to seek out precious treasures and relics that are at the center of the gameplay loop, as players will be actively spending most of their time defeating rooms of enemies to obtain them. During our hands-on experience, we immediately knew that no two dungeon clears will ever be the same, as each time players step inside a dungeon, the layout will procedurally change.</p>

<p>Each layout will feature a combination of Uncommon and Rare chests, weapon perks, unique dungeon events, blacksmith upgrades, and plenty of Elite enemies, mini bosses, and the dungeon boss to encounter. This allowed us to spend as much time in the first dungeon to get accustomed to the controls and combat mechanics to master clearing rooms without taking as much damage as possible, learn every enemy attack, and, of course, acquire as many relics and other treasures returning to the shop and sell them to customers (more on that later).</p>

<p>When embarking on a new dungeon run, every room will be randomized, and once cleared, they can follow its predetermined route by selecting which room to explore and learn what lies ahead, indicated by a map legend provided. Every room will have unique traps that can assist players, like fly traps, to knock enemies into them by using their backpack or attacking plants&nbsp;that will fire projectiles at enemies for extra offense.</p>

<p>These new enemies are no pushovers either (as implied by our death count), as players will encounter a myriad of adorable and imposing enemies that will attempt to prevent players from reaching the treasure at the room's exit. Luckily, there are perks to acquire for their weapons and their combat skills by exploring the Perk Rooms, which grant them unique buffs and status effects to inflict, which, personally, we do love the Wound (bleed) effect on our sword and gun, which helped us clear enemies more efficiently in our runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=GWxOko6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=FSu-JLvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We sure do love a good Bleed build if you wish to inflict additional damage to enemies with the Wound status effect.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>But do watch out, as the survivability will also be tested, as once the health has been depleted, players can opt to restart their dungeon run or return "home" to sell their acquired loot at the Moonlighter shop. Unlike the first game, players won't have to worry about losing their found relics and treasures should they fall in combat, as all items will lose some rarity stars, but also, armored relics will lose their shield too, a slight change from Moonlighter that players should be pleased about.</p>

<h2>Shop Til You Drop!</h2>

<p>Now, the game's perfect blend of shopkeeping and roguelike mechanics is what drew many players to the first game and will likely do the same for the sequel. The developers aimed at improving the formula by retaining most of what worked in <em>Moonlighter</em> and adjusted it for the sequel with the addition of new features to make the shopkeeping gameplay aspect more rewarding, like customization options, strategic decision-making through systems like resource management, and the aforementioned varied yet dynamic dungeon runs.</p>

<p>Yes, players can finally customize The Moonlighter shop after obtaining the K33PER bot, which offers various services to Will when interacting with the bot inside the shop. Players can rearrange the layout of display floor cases, place unique decor pieces that can improve the items' rarity or boost their pricing, change the wall and flooring, and more, as these options can be acquired by either finding recipes within the dungeons or spending Blob Vouchers by talking to Ms. Scratch.</p>

<p>Lastly, players will be able to gain temporary perks available at the cash register when making sales at The Moonlighter, and these can vary between gaining tips on top of sales, adding more rarity stars to their precious relics, or boosting Gold when making sales. Like with <em>Moonlighter</em>, players will get a feel for their customers when it comes to pricing their discovered treasures by adjusting the prices to see what appeases them before allowing them to leave as a satisfied customer with their desired item and a bargain, of course.</p>

<h2>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=sdd6A-Km 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=ZdVfL_6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Even during a dungeon run, there's always time for a quick splash in a healing pool.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> has a strong start to its Early Access launch based on what developer Digital Sun has produced for players. Over the course of this preview, we've found a rhythm of delving into dungeons to clear out enemies, discover recipes, and valuable crafting materials, but also pushing our limits on survivability on every run.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, no dungeon run is the same, as the procedural generation makes our time spent in the dungeon all that exciting but equally terrifying with the enemies we may or may not encounter. The perks available in these dungeons do help in defeating all more efficiently, but now and then, we experienced some technical errors, from input latency bugs to general performance issues, but it wasn't prolonged enough to drop us out of the game entirely.</p>

<p>Outside of exploring dungeons, we poured plenty of time into rearranging our shop layout, placing unique decor pieces to increase our sales and item rarity, which was a great change of pace, gameplay-wise, and the developers did a marvelous job of being able to strike a balance between dungeon crawling and shopkeeping.</p>

<p>With <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> is still in development while in Early Access, we'll be pushing our limits as a merchant and combative hero as we have found a new roguelike experience since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">Blue Prince</a> to put multiple hours into by meticulously working out our pricing guide and resource management, mastering enemy and boss attack patterns, and reaping the rewards of our successes.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault </em></strong><em>was previewed on PC over the course of 12 hours with a code provided by the developer - all screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.</em></p>

 <p>It’s a common-enough joke on the internet that GameStop’s trade-in values for even the latest games are pretty abysmal. But the advertisement for the “Trade Anything Day” features everything from a mug, to a taxidermied squirrel, to a lonely leather boot. “Bring Whatever, Get Store Credit” the ad reads, with “No Questions Asked” written at the bottom, modified to say “<i>Some</i> Questions Asked.*”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gabe-newell-500-million-yacht-new-buy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gabe-newell-just-bought-a-new-500-million-yacht-with-a-basketball-court-and-%E2%80%9915-gaming-stations%E2%80%99.1355854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve and a multi-billionaire gaming legend, has secured a brand-new yacht, custom-built to his desires and fitted with a whopping fifteen ‘gaming stations.’ What’s the betting that at least one of them features a Steam Machine?</p>



<p>The ‘high-performance vessel’ will reportedly support ‘everything from world-class hospitality to scientific research’, as the yacht is equipped with a <strong>science lab and dive center</strong>, amongst other things. The 360-foot, hybrid beast chalked up a production cost of between $375 and $530 million, proving that Gaben is eating <strong>well</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-valve-on-the-open-seas">Valve on the Open Seas</h2>



<p>Gabe Newell, the eclectic founder of Valve, is said to be worth more than $10 billion. He spends most of his time <strong>living </strong>aboard yachts, and his recent addition to his collection, the ‘Leviathan’, is simply another arrow in the quiver of ocean-faring palaces.</p>



<p>It’s the 50th largest yacht in the world, custom-built to match everything that Newell desired, and in a statement, the Valve head honcho gushed over the creation of the thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Working with the team at Oceanco is incredibly enjoyable and a lot of fun; everybody is professional, creative and dynamic. We knew we were asking for unusual things, and Oceanco embraced it with open arms. Not only have we designed a very unusual yacht that leans into Oceanco’s strengths of innovation and design, but the team has also been willing to collaborate with us on evolving the process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It could also have been one hell of a tax swindle, given that Gabe Newell <strong>owns Oceanco</strong>, the shipyard that built the Leviathan, but that’s just a silly thing to say.</p>



<p>The Leviathan features a submarine garage, more than a dozen premium gaming PCs, racing sim rigs, a basketball court, a hospital, and more bedrooms, kitchens, and relaxation areas than you can shake a stick at. It has been dubbed the most comfortable yacht ever designed, and it certainly seems like it <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the yacht’s brochure</a>.</p>



<p>And in true gamer form, it’s surrounded by a ring of RGB lights.</p>



<p>This one-of-a-kind vessel will serve several purposes and won’t necessarily be Gaben’s new home, but it’s nice to know he has his pick of the lot when it comes to hyper-expensive boats.</p>







<p>Recently, Valve revealed a slew of new gaming devices, including a new Steam Deck, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/">a Steam Machine</a>, and the Frame, a new virtual reality headset.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since its announcement, Mega Evolution's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-where-to-buy">Phantasmal Flames expansion</a> has ignited immediate interest across both competitive circles and the secondary market in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a>, and it’s stronger than ever with the launch of the full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">English set on November 14</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Mega Evolutions roaring back into prominence thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, and several cards offering unusually high ceiling damage or strong search power, the set has already produced an early hierarchy of valuable heavy-hitters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7M0e8?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, certain cards have already skyrocketed further in price, and, following up from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution round-up</a>, we’ve ranked the ten most expensive cards so far in Phantasmal Flames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From aggressive Mega attackers to powerful evolution support, Phantasmal Flames brings a fiery mix of competitive threats and high-demand pulls. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, Mega Lopunny ex offers top-tier tempo, Sharpedo ex delivers huge burst damage, and Dawn provides unmatched consistency for evolution decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the set’s true centrepieces are the three Mega Charizard X ex prints: with all of them sporting the powerful Inferno X attack, and commanding serious prices.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Lopunny ex – 115/094 (Ultra Rare)</h2><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230505"><div id="230505" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lopunny ex - 115/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting off the list is the standard Ultra Rare print of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRvgD?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lopunny ex</a>, and along with its colourfuly imposing art, it's no surprise if this card ends up a hit in the  in the current format. Gale Thrust may begin at 60, but if Mega Lopunny moved from the Bench to the Active Spot that turn, it jumps to 230 damage, which is an excellent rate for a single Colourless attachment. It slots neatly into pivot-based lists utilising switching loops or mobility engines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Spiky Hopper hits for 160 and ignores all effects on the opponent’s Active Pokemon, granting a clean answer to walls and defensive techs. Low costs, high numbers, and flexible deck compatibility keep this card’s value comfortably afloat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Piplup – 098/094 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230504"><div id="230504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Piplup - 098/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVElnJ?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Piplup</a> is a non-ex Basic, it enters the list because Call for Support is one of the strongest turn-one stabilisers the set provides. Being able to search any Supporter directly from the deck without drawback improves the early consistency of almost any list that can afford to include it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This kind of tutoring power is frequently undervalued in pre-release environments but becomes highly prized once decks tighten up. Most importantly, though, its winter-themed art by Hideki Ishikawa  — showing a slightly sad and lonely Piplup under a cliff, is simply adorable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between its splashable typing and immediate effect on turn sequencing, Piplup’s competitive utility easily justifies its early demand.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Meowth – 106/094 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230503"><div id="230503" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meowth 106/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meowth’s Fury Swipes attack is simple but mathematically solid for a Colourless Basic. At 20 damage per heads across three flips, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3vE8?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meowth</a> can occasionally push early pressure without requiring specific Energy types. In today’s meta, where some decks prefer low-investment starters that can chip for tempo, this puts Meowth on the radar as a flexible opener.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst not format-defining, cards that slot seamlessly into evolving or toolbox-style lists often find stable market interest, and the Illustration Rare for this Meowth with its mischievous-looking aesthetic is no exception.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Rotom ex – 126/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230502"><div id="230502" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rotom ex - 126/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rotom ex stands out because of its Multi Adapter ability, which allows each of your Rotom-named Pokemon to hold two Pokemon Tools. That alone opens up unique strategies involving damage modifiers, switching aids, or defensive attachments,essentially doubling the efficiency of Tool-based engines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its attack, Thunderbolt, hits for a respectable 130 in exchange for discarding all Energy. While not remarkable on its own, it becomes meaningful in lists built to recycle Energy or continuously buff damage through stacked Tools. At around $43 at the time of writing, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwgNw?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rotom's</a> competitive ceiling explains why its value is climbing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Mega Sharpedo ex – 127/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230501"><div id="230501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Sharpedo ex - 127/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Sharpedo ex brings an unusually threatening combination of draw power and burst damage. Greedy Fang drawing two cards keeps your engine moving, but it’s Hungry Jaws that has truly caught players’ attention. Starting at 120 and climbing to 270 damage if Sharpedo has any damage counters, the attack synergises perfectly with self-damage enablers and predictable chip from switching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darkness decks love aggression, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjgWb?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Sharpedo ex</a> delivers it at an appealing rate, along with the artwork of this Special Illustration Rare being strikingly agrresive, too. It is already being viewed as a centrepiece for future archetypes, hence its high price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mega Lopunny ex – 128/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230500"><div id="230500" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lopunny ex - 128/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp1AM?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lopunny ex</a> maintains the exact same competitive toolkit as the Ultra Rare but has surged further in value due to its importance in mobility-focused strategies, and its impactful illustration After all, the ability to consistently hit for 230 with a single Energy and a switch effect makes Lopunny one of the most Energy-efficient attackers in the set, but 5ban Graphics' artwork kicks this card up a notch,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s along with Spiky Hopper giving Mega Lopunny a reliable second option when facing tankier builds. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mega Charizard X ex – 109/094 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230499"><div id="230499" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 109/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Inferno X, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrxDZ?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> enters the meta as one of the scariest late-game sweepers in the expansion. Discarding any number of Fire Energy from your Pokémon to deal 90 damage per Energy creates a game-ending threat once ramp engines or mid-game acceleration are online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fire decks are gaining traction again thanks to several new support options, and Charizard’s scaling damage allows it to remove even tanky ex Pokemon in a single strike. With the colourful pink and green background art by takuyoa, this can easily be one of the most-eyecatching cards in the set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultra Rare or not, the card’s destructive potential certainly commands a premium.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Dawn – 129/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230498"><div id="230498" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dawn - 129/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a competitive standpoint, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8AYy?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn</a> is one of the best evolution-focused Supporters printed in recent sets, and her Special Illustration Rare is the best-looking way to add her to your deck. Fetching a Basic, a Stage 1, and a Stage 2 Pokémon all at once massively accelerates setup. Decks relying on multi-stage combos or heavy evolutions, particularly Megas, benefit enormously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, Dawn cuts down the number of turns required to assemble full lines, dramatically improving consistency. Supporters with this level of deck-building impact rarely stay cheap for long.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mega Charizard X ex – 130/094 (Mega Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230497"><div id="230497" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 130/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Identical in function to the other Charizard prints, the Mega Hyper Rare version retains the same brutally efficient Inferno X attack, but in a breathtaking golden presentation. The combination of universal Fire Energy support, high base HP, and late-game nuking potential makes <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgD5?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> a central threat in Fire archetypes — but now, this card also looks like it belongs on a first place medal as well as a binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that competitive players already expect the card to headline at least one top-tier deck, its market price reflects both power and scarcity.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mega Charizard X ex – 125/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230496"><div id="230496" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 125/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting comfortably at the top of Phantasmal Flames is the Special Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADnZq?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a>, and with good reason. In competitive terms, it shares the same terrifying damage ceiling as the other Charizard prints thanks to Inferno X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the visual presentation by takuyoa that takes this top-tier card further. The artwork depicts Mega Charizard X in a dramatic, full-scene composition: blue flames striking all-over, wings outstretched, and a mesmerising display of Charmander, Charmeleon, and base Charizard underneath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a rare example of a Charizard card that captures both the ferocity and scale of the Mega form without overcrowding the frame. Combined with its very limited pull rate, this treatment has made it the definitive chase card of the set, a blend of raw competitive power and high-end collector appeal that few other cards can match.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 17, 2025 4:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">As for Colossal Order, the studio will deliver a few more updates before Iceflake fully takes over. Those will include a major update that will add bikes, Old Town buildings, and other improvements. A beta version of the game's editor with mod-asset support will also arrive before the end of the year. Iceflake will then take over the franchise at the start of 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">In the forum post, Colossal Order Mariina Hallikainen said the studio never could have imagined Cities: Skylines would become a franchise played by millions.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're confident the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership," Hallikainen said. "As we move forward, we're excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision."</p><p dir="ltr">Iceflake will be sharing its own plans for Cities: Skylines 2 development in the coming weeks, and is working with Colossal Order to ensure a smooth transition, according to the forum post. Iceflake Studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said taking over the franchise is "an immense honor and a great responsibility," while noting the developer has a long history of making city-building games, like 2021's post-apocalyptic city-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/684450/Surviving_the_Aftermath/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Surviving the Aftermath</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game," Liljedahl said.</p><p dir="ltr">The forum post doesn't state a specific reason for why Colossal Order and Paradox are going their separate ways, but the launch of Cities: Skylines 2 wasn't exactly smooth. Prior to launch in October 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paradox-interactive-warns-of-cities-skyline-2-performance-issues-ahead-of-launch/1100-6518493/" data-ref-id="1100-6518493">Paradox warned players about the game's performance issues</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">After release, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-developers-provide-update-on-performance-issues-and-post-release-plans/1100-6518701/" data-ref-id="1100-6518701">acknowledged various performance problems</a> and stated its goal was to continue optimizing the title so that it could run at a stable 30 frames per second. In response to the game's rough launch, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-acknowledges-games-rough-state-and-rushed-dlc-making-big-changes/1100-6522761/" data-ref-id="1100-6522761">Beach Properties DLC was made free</a>, with additional content added to the game's Ultimate Edition. Cities: Skylines 2 currently sports a "Mixed" user review rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, while the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cities: Skylines</a> has "Very Positive" reviews.</p>

"After Krafton’s finance department, in May 2025, forecast a base-case earnout of $191 million, Krafton needed a way to 'cancel the earn-out.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-says-ai-generated-placeholder-artwork-slipped-into-anno-117-pax-romana" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft says AI-generated placeholder artwork 'slipped' into Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton is accused of initially attempting to persuade Unknown Worlds' founders to delay </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> based on "now-abandoned claims" the title was not ready for release.

It also states that Kim asked ChatGPT for advice on how to avoid paying the earnout. The generative AI tool reportedly told Kim it would be "difficult to cancel" the payout.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Not only was Krafton’s bottom line at stake; the earnout was a threat to Kim's job. Krafton thus took action to neutralize the threat of paying the earnout," continues the pre-brief.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that realisation sunk in, Krafton and Kim are accused of terminating the plaintiffs by falsely accusing them of attempting to proceed with the "premature" release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The pre-brief, however, states that during the discovery phase of the legal battle, Krafton CFO and corporate designee Yoon "could not name a single Krafton employee who actually thought the game was unready for release."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-owned-crystal-dynamics-confirms-another-round-of-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics confirms another round of layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The plaintiffs also note that, following an internal milestone review on May 27, 2025, Krafton creative director Hyeon-gyu Park agreed that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should launch into early access in August 2025 as previously planned.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, we got the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/new-planet-hopping-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-shows" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58d35eab-b2e4-4e79-a241-2819c736ec51" data-entity-substitution="canonical">first proper trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, but it seems Nintendo had more movie teasers ready to go for this week. Today, shared on the <a href="https://nintendo.today/s/aQWvIocH">Nintendo Today App</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434768853606880?s=20">on social media</a>, we got our first glimpse at the live-action adaptation of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, which just started filming in New Zealand. You can take a look at Link and Zelda below.</p>



<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="42052ba5-e7ce-4d85-b3bf-cf6d01a42b2b" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>The images show Link, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/nintendo-reveals-link-and-zelda-actors-for-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a92df43d-dc74-44ad-b28d-715b1074e8b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical">played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, and Zelda, played by Bo Bragason</a>, in a sprawling green countryside, presumably somewhere in Hyrule. On social media, the images are accompanied by a message from Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. We know this because he starts the message by saying, "This is Miyamoto." The full statement is as follows.</p><p>This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link. Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.</p><p>We know very little about the movie outside its two main cast members, but this image provides some morsels of context to speculate about. Both Link and Zelda's designs seem to be partially inspired by their most recent iterations on Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which is unsurprising, given the success of each of those games. Zelda, for example, is wearing blue, which is unlike her typical pink/purple and white attire found in prior games. Link is wearing his traditional green, which is unlike the newer games and is specifically evocative of his Twilight Princess look. Still, his cap-less appearance certainly evokes his newer design. Besides, Link <em>can </em>wear green in the newer games; his iconic Champion's Tunic dominates much of the promotional material, but his attire is more variable than Zelda's.</p><p>More notably, Link doesn't appear to have a weapon in these images, which raises many questions about his relationship to Zelda in this scene. He's typically tasked with defending or rescuing her, but when she has a weapon and he has nothing, that dynamic doesn't seem feasible here. Could she be a mentor figure in this scene? Or could this be a version of Link that has to learn to be brave across the course of the film? At this time, it's all unclear, but we're eager to learn more as we approach the game's May 2027 release date.</p><p>For more Nintendo news, you can check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/everything-we-learned-in-nintendos-direct-for-the-super-mario-galaxy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6151d643-41cb-4b79-a1df-e0070f202633" data-entity-substitution="canonical">a recap of everything from last week's Mario Galaxy Movie Direct right here</a>, or read our review of the latest Zelda spin-off, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/reverent-but-redundant" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="104533c3-31d3-4973-bc53-ce44f2cc4210" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/17/nintendo-shares-first-images-from-the-set-of-the-live-action-zelda-movie]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I, like probably many folks, only know about Charles Guiteau’s assassination of short-term president James Garfield from Stephen Sondheim’s musical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAnHW2qwc2Y&amp;list=RDLAnHW2qwc2Y&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Assassins</u></em></a>. So I was a little baffled when I saw the trailer for Netflix’s <em>Death by Lightning</em>, a four-episode series about the largely forgotten moment in history. But this question of memory is one of the things the show grapples with, and it ends up turning my first thought of “why would you make a show about this?” into something modern and affecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think <em>Death by Lightning</em> would work with a lesser cast. <em>Succession</em>’s Matthew Macfadyen as Guiteau is such a good choice–if anyone should play a minor historical figure with delusions of grandeur, it’s the guy who played Tom Wambsgans. Nick Offerman is very fun as vice president Chester A. Arthur, which is not a thing I’ve ever said about Chester A. Arthur. Michael Shannon brings a lot of depth to Garfield, though it always remains a little unfortunate that the show chooses to focus on him so much, when despite being the pillar around which all these interesting characters spin, he’s often the least interesting character in the room.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jopqrSojQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Death by Lightning | Official Trailer | Netflix"></iframe></figure><p>After giving a stirring speech in support of another candidate at the 1880 Republican National Convention, Garfield is elected the party’s presidential candidate. He’s surrounded by corrupt, self-serving blowhards, and over the course of his campaign he becomes convinced that maybe he can undo the political machine. In this way he’s very similar to Guiteau, a grifter who at least professes to have noble intentions, and who never quite seems to believe he’s grifting even as he lies and steals and confabulates. After a brief encounter on the campaign trail, Guiteau comes to believe he’s destined for a powerful position in Garfeild’s administration, and he spends the rest of the series trying to get what he feels he deserves.</p><p><em>Death by Lightning</em> walks a skillful line where there’s never any of the unbearable secondhand cringe of shows like <em>The Office</em> in watching Guiteau put himself out there. Guiteau often comes off as completely earnest and legitimate, which helps him con and win over those around him. He’s enthusiastic about and interested in people, and he’s both a very good con man and a terrible one, often failing to think through crucial bits of his cover stories because he seems to believe his own lies too much. He’s good at getting himself into the right place at the right time, but despite making real relationship in-roads with Arthur and others, he can never quite cross the line into becoming an actual insider. It’s hard not to root for him when Macfadyen plays him so compellingly, but it’s also impossible to root for him when he is so obviously wrong about what he thinks is happening. He is, in some ways, a parallel of Garfield’s quest to end political corruption–he believes that anyone should have a shot at greatness, and that people should do what they say they’re going to do–but he also completely embodies that corruption in his willingness to say and do anything to get close to power.</p><p>After completely undoing himself in an audience with Garfield–Guiteau’s artifice falls away, and he begs the president to “help me succeed like you did… Tell me how I can be great too” in a moment that is wonderfully intimate and also completely blowing it–and after finally being told in no uncertain terms he has no hope of a position in Garfield’s administration, Guiteau turns from being a booster for the president to seeing him as a corrupt liar Guiteau alone is charged with stamping out. Given that this turn is probably the only reason you’ve ever heard Guiteau’s name, it’s a bit unfortunate that most of this arc is crammed into the show’s final episode, which also has to cover the shooting, Garfield’s <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/james-garfield-assassination-us-president?ref=aftermath.site"><u>slow death from infection</u></a>, and Guiteau’s trial. Too much of <em>Death by Lightning</em>’s final hour is taken up by a focus on Garfield that felt unnecessary and not terribly interesting compared to the big questions Guiteau’s character raises, even as it’s moving to see those close to him struggle with his death. The show clearly wants to highlight the similarities between Garfield and Guiteau’s stories and the things they’ve done to earn their non-places in history, but the focus on Garfield as the lens through which to do it leaves a lot of good stuff on the table.</p><p>I was meant to see a 2001 <em>Assassins</em> revival that was <a href="https://variety.com/2003/legit/news/b-way-gunning-for-assassins-1117893021/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ultimately delayed to 2004</u></a> after 9/11 made its subject matter feel inappropriate; living in New York as Bush used my city as a pretense for war felt like the perfect time for the show to me, even though I understood the argument against it. <em>Death by Lightning</em> could be held to a similar “really, <em>now?</em>” criticism,&nbsp; though rather than raising issues about our <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Attempted_assassinations_of_Donald_Trump,_2024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>current president</u></a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired/"><u>Charlie Kirk</u></a>, its subject matter felt closest to some of the rhetoric of January 6. What are the consequences of the intimacy between a political leader and their adherents, whether that intimacy is a true belief or just campaign trail smoke? What does the government owe its people compared to what they perceive they’re owed, and what should people do when they feel failed? What happens to historical moments when history itself gets its claws in them–the meaning of January 6 is being constantly rewritten, its participants by turn traitors and heroes, but which story will win out in the arc of history? Will any of these people be remembered and, if so, for what? <em>Death by Lightning</em>’s Guiteau feels like a precursor to those who stormed the Capitol in 2021, deluded and disenfranchised, seeing in the anti-Garfield rhetoric around him a chance to air his own personal grievances and try–and fail–to make them about something bigger than himself.</p><p>In the end, <em>Death by Lightning</em> feels like it shines a light on the temporary nature of history, how the things that matter so much to us as we live through them will be seen differently by those who come after, if they even think of us at all. It reminds the viewer that no moment in history is <em>the most important</em> moment in history, even if it feels that way to its participants. While it works against itself a bit in the way it handles Garfield, it’s a welcome reminder that history is still happening and that our roles in it are still being written.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Paradox Interactive and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> developer Colossal Order are going their separate ways, the companies have announced, with ongoing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines II</a> and the franchise in general moving to a separate studio under the Paradox umbrella, Iceflake Studios.</p>
<p>Colossal Order will wrap up on a few updates – the Bike patch, Old Town buildings, bug fixes and more, as well as a beta of the Editor and Asset Mods. Iceflake Studios (who also happen to be based in Tampere, Finland and released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/08/surviving-the-aftermath-review-ps4/">Surviving The Aftermath in 2021</a>) will be getting up to speed to take over development from the start of 2026, and will be responsible for free updates, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, and future expansions and content packs.</p>


<p>Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order, writes, “For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order. When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</p>
<p>Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive added, “Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we’ve enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it’s remarkable how much we’ve achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.”</p>

<p>And Iceflake Studio Manager Lasse Liljedahl said, “Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility. There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Bridges &amp; Ports | Release Trailer | Cities: Skylines II" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/usC_JmcR45c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After the broad success and popularity of Cities: Skylines, it’s no secret that Colossal Order has grappled with the scope of developing Cities: Skylines II. Originally announced as a cross-platform release, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/28/cities-skylines-2-delayed-on-console-to-spring-2024-still-coming-to-pc-on-24th-october/">the console versions were delayed</a> and it arrived for PC at the end of 2023 to a wave of dissatisfaction over game optimisation, features and bugs. CO plugged away at the game for the past two years, but had to indefinitely delay the console version, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">pushed back and refund DLC</a>. It outwardly looked like the team might have turned a corner, releasing the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC a few weeks ago, but clearly all parties felt it was time for a clean slate.</p>
<p>Hopefully Iceflake is able to quickly get up to speed with the game, and we look forward to seeing what Colossal Order’s next project might be.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released the first images of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/08/the-legend-of-zelda-to-be-turned-in-to-a-film-developed-by-shigeru-miyamoto/">The Legend of Zelda’s live-action film adaptation</a>, confirming that filming is underway in a “lush, natural setting.”</p>
<p>Borrowing the phone with the company’s social media account logins, <a href="https://xcancel.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067">Shigeru Miyamoto writes</a>:</p>


<p>“This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link.”</p>

<p>“Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.”</p>

<p>You’ve got to say that the casting of Bo and Benjamin looks pretty spot on visually, and it’s interesting to see the direction that they’ve taken visually. It certainly looks to lean into the visual identity of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> era of the game series, with Zelda in a blue dress and the pair of them hanging out in a field. In fact, I think I remember one or two of the flashback story beats from Breath of the Wild that this could be recreating.</p>
<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM is confident that its next flagship triple-A game, Resident Evil Requiem, won't suffer from the same performance issues that have plagued its previous big release, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>



<p>Today, the Japanese publisher <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a translated Q&amp;A</a> from the latest conference call for the first half<br>of the fiscal year. In the call, an investor specifically inquired about this topic and received the following response:</p>



<p><em>Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features. At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.</em></p>



<p>It is indeed true that the two games are very different. One of the main selling points of the most recent Monster Hunter game was its open world-like hunting experience, but it was also clear that the RE Engine did not adapt very well to open worlds, as originally glimpsed in Dragon's Dogma 2, another open world game with significant performance problems. After an explosive launch, Monster Hunter Wilds sales slowed down considerably, and even an older game like Devil May Cry 5 managed to outsell it in the previous quarter. </p>



<p>The performance issue was so impactful, especially on PC, that CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to cancel a lecture on the game's technical features</a> after receiving harassment and threats from angry gamers. However, there's good reason to believe them about Resident Evil Requiem. While the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started as an open world title</a> with multiplayer features, it was eventually reworked as a single player game with smaller environments. In this scenario, the RE Engine has usually performed well enough, and there's no reason to believe that will change here. In fact, the developers were <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pleasantly surprised</a> at how well the game runs on the Nintendo Switch 2, the least powerful of all the supported platforms. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Q&amp;A, CAPCOM executives confirmed the publisher's goal to surpass initial sales of the previous franchise installment, Village, with Resident Evil Requiem. As a reminder, Resident Evil Village shipped three million units in the first four days, making it the third fastest-selling game in the survival horror series.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026. Read our Gamescom 2025 hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
