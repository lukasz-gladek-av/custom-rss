			<p>Wolfenstein developer MachineGames is known for their solid writing and penchant for diabolical nazi villains, which is probably what got them the gig making <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but they also just know how to make a good shooter. The Wolfenstein games deliver a lot of guns-blazing, gory action, so will their Indiana Jones game be the same?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. While being interviewed on the Official Xbox Podcast, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle director Jerk Gustafsson explained the goal is to make a “proper adventure game” that targets a “wider audience” than their previous hardcore shooters. As such, more often than not stealth and puzzle solving will be the best route forward, and when you do run afoul of the bad guys, you’ll frequently be punching them out instead of shooting them down.</p>
<p><em>“We're used to having these heavy weapons, gun-blazing shooters. This is a little big different. We are making a proper adventure game here, and it's also a game that is a little more directed at toward a wider audience, [which is] a bit of a new thing for us. </em></p>
<p><em>We prioritized that we had to stay true to Indy's personality, and who he is above all. He is a normal human being. He is not this caped superhero. He is flawed, he makes mistakes, he stumbles. There is weight to his movement and we have this gritty pulp edge to the action. But, at the same time, he's also rather athletic, he's an excellent fighter, and he has an enormous amount of luck as well. </em></p>
<p><em>It is something that we've been focused on a lot when it comes to gameplay. [Indy] solves problems with his mind first and really relies on smarts, not this excessive combat that we've seen or done before in the Wolfenstein games. So, when you are playing the game, choosing the more authentic stealth route, or just some classic fist fighting, will be a benefit to the player and, more times than not, also make for a very fun and challenging experience.”</em></p>
<p>The full Official Xbox Podcast interview is worth checking out, as the MachineGames guys get into a variety of topics, including the game’s locations (Marshall College, the Himalayas, Egypt, Thailand, the Vatican, and “a couple” of other locations), and the fact there will be a “couple” classic character cameos we haven’t seen yet. They also touch on the work they’ve done with Lucasfilm to ensure the game’s authenticity, Troy Baker’s work as Indy, and more. You can check it all out, below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24178688/the-imaginary-review-studio-ponoc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="DgF39t"><small>This review of </small><small><em>The Imaginary </em></small><small>is timed to the film’s festival premiere at France’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival. The film will stream on Netflix in America starting on July 5.</small></p>
<p id="dW9XlZ">When Studio Ponoc’s first anime feature, <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em>, premiered in 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16358234/mary-and-the-witchs-flower-movie-review-anime-studio-ghibli-ponoc">it came as a relief</a> — a promise that the legacy of Japan’s famed animation powerhouse Studio Ghibli wouldn’t be entirely lost with Ghibli’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/4/5966439/studio-ghibli-shutting-down-restructuring-ni-no-kuni">rumored plans to shut down</a>. Founded by Ghibli veteran Yoshiaki Nishimura (producer of <em>When Marnie Was There</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275363/isao-takahata-studio-ghibli-animation-innovation-japanese-art-princess-kaguya"><em>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</em></a>), and taking on former Ghibli employees in an attempt to preserve their experience and skills for future animated projects, Ponoc came into the world openly billed as Ghibli’s successor. <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em> was so clearly modeled on Ghibli designs and storytelling that the transition seemed fait accompli.</p>
<p id="0znUkE">But Ghibli stayed in business, with co-founder Hayao Miyazaki laboring away on another animated feature, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review"><em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a>, while his son Goro experimented with digital animation to make the television movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22258621/earwig-and-the-witch-review-studio-ghibli"><em>Earwig and the Witch</em></a>. And Ponoc’s output has been slow over the past seven years, with no new feature films — just the charming shorts collection <em>Modest Heroes</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22590291/olympics-2021-anime-studio-ponoc-short-tomorrows-leaves">some lovely promotional projects</a>. So its new feature <em>The Imaginary</em> is a second round of relief for animation fans — both because the company is still in the moviemaking business, and because <em>The Imaginary</em> sees it just starting to edge away from outright Ghibli mimicry. (And, as a side note, because 2024 has been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177114/the-imaginary-netflix-release-date-studio-ponoc">a terrible year for cinematic imaginary friends</a> so far.)</p>

<p id="RpL5Uq"><em>The Imaginary </em>just debuted at France’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and comes to Netflix July 5 via an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24049777/studio-ponoc-the-imaginary-netflix-release-date">exclusive distribution deal</a>. Adapted from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-F-Harrold/dp/0802738117?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-F-Harrold/dp/0802738117?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23942729__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23942729__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">2014 novel by British author A.F. Harrold</a>, the film follows a spunky young girl named Amanda and her imaginary friend Rudger. (Not “Roger,” she and Rudger keep indignantly reminding people, but <em>Rudger</em>, which in Netflix’s dub and the kids’ posh British accents is pronounced pretty much the same way.) Rudger is a little blond boy who joins Amanda on all her imaginary adventures, and seems to regard her more like a playmate than a creator, though it’s notable that she occasionally treats him like a favored toy — something respected and beloved, but still capable of being banged about a bit for excitement and drama. </p>
<p id="2mtzNT">Amanda’s father has recently died, and while her mother, Elizabeth, has struggled to keep the family bookstore open, she’s ready to shut it down and move on to a more secure line of work. Elizabeth seems like a kind woman who’s a bit at the end of her rope, trying to deal with grief, a failing business, and a hyper kid who leaves messes behind because she has her head in the clouds, then blames them on her imaginary friend. Their dynamic feels notably like the <a href="https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-mom-biggest-freakouts/">frustrated family energy</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/5/13/21254476/calvin-and-hobbes-comic-strips-books-quarantine"><em>Calvin and Hobbes</em></a>: Elizabeth wants Amanda to pick up after herself and pay attention to her surroundings, while Amanda is distracted by the elaborate, adventurous worlds she’s creating. But where Hobbes’ relationship with Calvin’s mother mostly comes down to a minor frustration that she doesn’t make tuna fish sandwiches more often, Rudger has more melancholy longings. He thinks of Elizabeth as his mother, too, and wishes she could see and acknowledge him. </p>

</p>
<p id="tLbM7I">There’s a lot more <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> energy at play in <em>The Imaginary</em>: Like Bill Watterson’s comic-strip duo, Amanda and Rudger climb into a box and it suddenly becomes a vehicle flying through the air as the real world falls away. The games they play together are more real to them than anything else in the world, and their partnership is more vivid and crucial than Amanda’s other friendships.</p>
<p id="xe6aHf">The movie’s most exciting, most visually exalted sequences come whenever the story enters the imagination realm, where form is fleeting and fluid. People, objects, and settings all transform on a whim, and the possibilities seem limitless. Ghibli animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271278/spirited-away-watch-best-studio-ghibli-movie"><em>Spirited Away</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21275119/porco-rosso-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-ending"><em>Porco Rosso</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart"><em>Whisper of the Heart</em></a>) directs the film with the kind of dedication to shape-shifting and symbolic shifting <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/832-the-gross-fluids-and-clean-fluidity-of-spirited-aw/">Hayao Miyazaki brings to his best movies</a>. (<em>Millennium Actress</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24173761/scavengers-reign-influences-inspirations-more-like-shows-miyazaki"><em>Paprika</em></a>, and <em>Perfect Blue</em> director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/30/20836173/perfect-blue-satoshi-kon-explained">Satoshi Kon</a> made a similar fluidity of form a signature in his movies, but usually with a conscious aggression and sense of nightmare threat instead of Miyazaki’s and Momose’s expression of bouncy joy.)</p>
<p id="NafmE4">But where Miyazaki movies <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21269323/castle-in-the-sky-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki-villains-explained">generally avoid outright villains</a>, <em>The Imaginary</em> has a particularly compelling and present threat. There are plenty of Miyazaki-style emotional stakes as well — Rudger, like other imaginary friends, is in danger of fading away if Amanda isn’t focused on him, and he gets to see firsthand what happens to “imaginaries” whose children die, grow up, or move on. But <em>The Imaginary</em> compounds the danger with an actual villain, who’s better discovered than described, and who brings an old-school sense of gleeful, gloating wrongdoing to the movie, alongside all its sunny explorations of children’s adventures in the worlds they create.</p>

<p id="ZztERr"><em>The Imaginary</em>’s animation still shows plenty of Ghibli influence, from the overstuffed, painterly rooms packed with gleamingly detailed objects to the way characters cry, with rivers of outsized, glutinous tears pumping down their faces in messy rivers. In close-ups, when experiencing big emotions, Amanda and Rudger look very much like off-brand Ghibli characters, just a touch off-model. But Ponoc’s film is edging toward its own look as well — a softer, more painterly color scheme, thinner lines and flatter colors, and character designs a little closer to Toho-Towa’s 1989 international release <em>Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</em> than to any specific Ghibli movie.</p>
<p id="5XGmQq">And Ponoc’s film also feels like it’s aimed more firmly at younger viewers than most of Ghibli’s work. The screen is frequently filled with high-energy bustle, as Rudger meets an entire colony of displaced Imaginaries or the story heads inside a different kid’s imagination. But the story itself is fairly simple and straightforward, exploring feelings of pain, loss, and fear in the Pixar mode. There are a couple of authentically scary moments, but mostly, the film keeps a kid-forward outlook, where children face the perils and solve the problems adults are oblivious to, and playtime frequently takes center stage.</p>
<p id="t9BrTu"><em>The Imaginary</em> isn’t as visually or narratively rich as <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em>, or as transcendent as Miyazaki projects like <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>. But it does feel like a move in the right direction for Ponoc, an effort at finding its own voice and its own footing. It may not be remembered decades from now with the same fond fervor as Ghibli’s early projects, but if Ponoc keeps experimenting and keeps branching out, it might well be remembered as the first step toward forming its own distinctive creative legacy, and stepping out from under Ghibli’s shadow. In the meantime, it’s a giddily thrilling experience for young anime fans, a movie aimed at visualizing what it feels like to daydream as a kid, to enter a world of absolute imagination where everything else falls away. </p>

<p data-characters="309" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players have successfully rescued a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-latest-mo-forcing-players-to-choose-between-anti-tank-mines-and-saving-sick-kids-is-going-as-well-as-you-imagine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital full of sick children</a>, rather than unlocking a mine Stratagem. Wow, after typing that out, it really wasn’t much of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfspv6/isnt_that_sweet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moral dilemma</a> after all. Arrowhead is celebrating by donating to charity, while hinting that players can still earn the mines. </p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">The donation news reached divers <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801603873502638151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via a message</a> dropped by CCO Johan Pilestedt on X. Following the liberation of Vernen Wells, Arrowhead Games donated $4,311 to Save the Children. </p> <figure data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">For those wondering, 4,311 looks like “HELL” when punched into a calculator. It’s also the number of kids rescued from the in-game hospital. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The donation to Save the Children was warmly embraced by many members of the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, some of whom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfs2ln/operation_save_the_children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also donated</a> to the foundation not long after hearing the notice. Another member suggested a new cape to celebrate the victory. I have to put my vote in for the one below, for hitting me right in the nostalgia.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-players-get-one-more-shot-at-earning-the-mines-stratagem" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players get one more shot at earning the mines Stratagem</h2> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">Even though <em>Helldivers 2</em> players opted to save Vernen Wells over Marfark, the Major Order still has less than a day before ending — as of this writing. When asked, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801625047418667450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pilestedt confirmed</a> that players can still earn the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines Stratagem so long as they can liberate Marfark in the small window of time. Apparently, the game’s DM Joel said “they never will,” which sounds to me like a challenge.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You will!</p><p>Joel said.

 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="false">I have a feeling that if players fail to earn the Stratagem again, it probably won’t be the last it gets dangled in their faces. At this point, divers unable to unlock the Anti-Tank Mines have become something of an inside joke, possibly to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfttao/well_unlock_them_eventually/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chagrin of the devs</a> who worked on the Stratagem. There’s always next time. Maybe.</p>

It claims those disputes will be processed by Asus’ own staff rather than outsourced customer support agents.</p><div><p>And, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader">failing to even acknowledge the ROG Ally handheld’s SD card reader issues</a> for over a year, the company will be finally be issuing a formal statement about the defect next week, <em>Gamers Nexus</em> is reporting.</p></div><p>One month ago, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7pMrssIrKcY"><em>GN </em>revealed</a> that Asus could in some instances charge customers for unwanted and unneeded repairs, among other issues.

ASUS has promised us an email this month with other changes.</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunds of service charges for unnecessary repairs which customers felt compelled to accept in order to have a warranted repair covered, such as unrelated or misclassified CID [Customer Induced Damage]</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunding shipping charges in scenarios where a warranted repair was part of the RMA. For clarity, if a customer has both an out-of-warranty repair and an in-warranty repair in the same claim, shipping will be covered by ASUS</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunding labor and taxes related to these aforementioned qualifying disputes</p><p>ASUS has created a Task Force team to retroactively go back through a long history of customer surveys that were negative to try and fix the issues</p><p>ASUS has removed the power from the repair centers to claim CID. Now, CID claims must go through ASUS’ team. This will remove some of the financial incentive to fail devices. There still is one, but now it won’t be motivated as much by speed</p><p>ASUS is creating a new support center in the US. This will enable customers to choose between a repair of their board or a faster swap with a refurbished board. This solves an issue where refurbs were the only option in some scenarios previously</p><p>After over a year of refusing to acknowledge the microSD card reader failures on the ROG Ally, ASUS will be posting a formal statement next week about the defect, resulting from this series</p><p>ASUS will publish a more transparent repair report template in September of 2024</p><p>ASUS is changing the Advance RMA language to reduce emphasis on physical damage</p></blockquote></div><p>Also, here’s an email template you can use when emailing that executivecare@asus.com address, as provided by Asus itself:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Your Name (as listed in your RMA):&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>RMA Number:</em></p><p><em>Serial Number:</em></p><p><em>RMA application country:</em></p><p><em>Please describe your previous RMA dispute:</em></p><p><em>Supporting Documents (e.g., charged invoice, quotation notification, photos):</em></p><p><em>Additional Feedback (optional):</em></p></blockquote></div><p>Asus says it should respond to emails sent to that address within a week. </p><p>The company is also apologizing today for previous experiences you might have had with repairs. “We’re very sorry to anyone who has had a negative experience with our service team. We appreciate your feedback and giving us a chance to make amends.”</p><p><em>Gamers Nexus</em> says it’s not taking Asus at its word. “[W]e already have devices in their RMA centers under pseudonyms and plan to continue sampling them over the next 6-12 months so we can ensure these are permanent improvements,” writes editor-in-chief Steve Burke.</p><p>Asus had previously laid out a handful of promised customer support improvements <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fsite%2Fsupportupdates">at this link</a> (pdf).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Yacht Club Games just announced a new mainline game in the hit series that started as a retro-inspired 2D platformer, and the studio says this new game will “launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming,” <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/what-s-next-for-shovel-knight/">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough of a clue about the move to 3D, the Yacht Club Games’ Friday livestream celebrating the 10th anniversary of <em>Shovel Knight</em> featured an even more pointed hint: a 3D version of the Yacht Club Games logo.</p><p>The studio is staying mum about many specifics — there’s no release window — but did tease that “the game will bring electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a <em>Shovel Knight</em> title.” </p><p>While you wait for that new game, Yacht Club Games will have a lot of new things you can play. The studio also <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-shovel-of-hope-dx-announcement/">announced <em>Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</em></a>, the “definitive edition” of the original <em>Shovel Knight</em> title that adds things like online multiplayer, stereoscopic 3D, a rewind power, in-game cheats, and the ability to play as 20 different Shovel Knight characters. Yacht Club Games says the game is “coming soon.” <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-dig-wicked-wishes-launches-summer-2024/"><em>Shovel Knight Dig</em></a> and <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-pocket-dungeon-paradox-pack-releases-summer-2024/"><em>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon</em></a> are also getting free DLC this summer. </p><p>The developer also shared <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db5MbAFiFlOA">new footage of <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>, its upcoming game that looks to be heavily inspired by the Game Boy classic <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Mina</em> also has a vague “coming soon” launch date, and I look forward to a more specific release window — the game looks fantastic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s estimated that the value of all the games is around 70,000 yuan or about $9,660 USD. </p><p>In China, Article 7 of the Regulations on the Implementation of Customs Administrative Punishments of the People’s Republic of China prohibits people from evading customs by “hiding, disguising, concealing declarations, false declarations or other means, transporting, carrying, or mailing goods that are prohibited or restricted from entry or exit by the state.” And like in most countries, bringing in goods without paying the necessary taxes is illegal and considered smuggling. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://english.customs.gov.cn/statics/4440eff0-0440-4876-8f8a-9c8f16be4355.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://english.customs.gov.cn/statics/4440eff0-0440-4876-8f8a-9c8f16be4355.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As pointed out by<em> Tom’s Hardware</em></a></span>, assuming the Switch carts aren’t considered “restricted” by China, the woman suspected of smuggling games in her bra is unlikely to see jail time. Instead, she could be fined “not more than three times the amount of duties payable but evaded.” </p><p>Now, for folks out there who wear or have access to bras, and also a bunch of Switch games, here’s my challenge to you: Try to fit 350 Switch carts into some lingerie. I’m guessing this isn’t an easy feat. Just getting them all in there to begin with sounds hard enough. And then you have to carry all that weight and plastic on your chest while trying to look normal. I’m not sure I could do it. And I guess neither could the woman caught by Chinese officials. </p><p><strong> .</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">A lot has changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>. Among some of the changes that will affect your game as you grind toward high-level content is how Exotic armors are divvied out going forward. The old way of unlocking new Exotics, by playing through Lost Sectors, is over. Instead, you'll need to earn reputation with Rahool, the Tower Cryptarch, if you want access to those spiffy new armor pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's a quick rundown of how Exotic armor works now, how things have changed, and what it'll take to rank up with Rahool enough to get access to his new wares.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Out_With_The_Lost_Sectors">Out With The Lost Sectors</h2><p dir="ltr">Destiny 2 has added a lot of new Exotic armors over the last few years, and The Final Shape has two new armor pieces for each character class. You can earn one of them by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-campaign-missions-list-and-how-long-to-beat/1100-6524012/" data-ref-id="1100-6524012">completing The Final Shape's Legend campaign</a>, but the other will remain locked until you either complete the campaign again, or gain access to a new brand of Exotic focusing: Tier 3 focusing.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, to gain new Exotic armor, the trick was to complete the daily, rotating Lost Sector on Legend or Master difficulty. Each day featured a different kind of armor, so if you were missing an Exotic helmet from your collection, you'd wait for the head armor day to come around and play through the Lost Sector until you got the helmet you wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">From now on, though, that method is over--while the daily Legend/Master Lost Sector still rotates around the map, it no longer drops a specific type of Exotic armor. You can still play Legend and Master Lost Sectors to earn high-end materials and Exotic engrams, but you won't earn any specific Exotic armor from them.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Rahool_For_All_your_Exotic_Armor">Visit Rahool For All your Exotic Armor</h2><p dir="ltr">Instead, apart from what you get from the campaign or specific Exotic missions, all new Exotic armor pieces go through Rahool. He's the guy who decrypts Exotic and Prime Engrams for you in the Tower. Rahool now has a reputation system, so the more Engrams you decode, the more points you get, unlocking rewards along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Rahool also offered "Focusing" services that let you pick what piece of Exotic armor you would get out of an Exotic Engram. You had three options: You could decrypt the Exotic Engram normally and get a random piece of armor at no cost other than spending the Engram; you could focus the decryption on a specific expansion or seasonal release to narrow the random pool down to just a few Exotic armors, but at a cost of Glimmer and Enhancement Prisms (called Tier 1 Focusing); or you could pick the specific piece of armor you wanted, if you were willing to pay more Glimmer and Ascendant Shards (called Tier 2 Focusing).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319626" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319626"></a><figcaption>Tier 3 Focused Decoding, otherwise called Novel Decryption, lets you buy any Exotic armor in the game as long as you have an Engram and an Exotic Cipher.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With The Final Shape, Rahool adds Tier 3 Focusing, which allows you to buy "novel" pieces of Exotic armor to add to your Collections tab. These will cost you one Exotic Engram as well as an Exotic Cipher, which you can earn from ranking up with Rahool or from Xur when he shows up each weekend. Xur will offer you an Exotic Cipher quest so you can earn one each week, and you'll get another for resetting his reputation rank. There are also a small number of Exotic Ciphers available as rank rewards on the Season Pass. You can hold up to five in your inventory.</p><p dir="ltr">All that said, you don't start with access to Tier 3 Focusing--you have to reach Rank 17 with Rahool in order to unlock it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Increase_Your_Cryptarch_Rank">How To Increase Your Cryptarch Rank</h2><p dir="ltr">This part's easy, although it can be either time-consuming or expensive. To increase your rank with Rahool, all you need to do is decrypt Engrams. The more specific your decryption, the more reputation points you earn for each one, so Tier 2 decryption gets you the most points (500), Tier 1 decryption gets you a little less, decrypting an Exotic Engram drops it even more, and decrypting a Prime Engram gets you the least.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to rank up quickly, then, you should knock out some Tier 2 Focusing decryptions. These can get expensive in a hurry, but they will rank you up <em>fast</em>--many of the Cryptarch ranks are only a few hundred points, and even at the top end, ranks cost around 800 points, so you can climb this in minutes if you have materials and Engrams stockpiled.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you reach the top of the reputation ranks for Rahool, Tier 3 Focusing unlocks for all your characters, and you no longer have to worry about it. You'll now be able to purchase new Exotic armors, including the ones from The Final Shape's Legend campaign, as long as you have Engrams and Exotic Ciphers.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape guides hub</a> for many more answers about what's new in Destiny 2, and read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a> while you're at it.</p>

If you’re unfamiliar, <em>Shovel Knight Dig</em> is the roguelite spinoff to 2014’s <em>Shovel Knight</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Shovel Knight Dig Wicked Wishes DLC Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raR31fIgTPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="118" data-injectable="false">I don’t mean to tease, but on the stream, they refer to the additional challenges as “rip-roaring.” It’s cute.</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Alongside the DLC, they’re also promising over 100 bug fixes, a rebalanced algorithm, and localization fixes. Considering that quite a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shovel-knight-dig-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few player complaints</a> seem to be just about things that need to be tightened, rebalanced, or tweaked, hopefully, this will be exactly what the game needs.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Yacht Club is also saying that this will be the last updated for <em>Shovel Knight Dig</em>. They’re putting a ribbon on it and calling it done. Or however that saying goes. To top things off, they’re releasing ports for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="false"><em>Shovel Knight Dig</em> is currently available for Switch, PC, and mobile platforms. The <em>Wicked Wishes</em> DLC and PS5 and Xbox Series X|S version are aiming for this summer.</p>

<p data-characters="381" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A world with rival houses, big medieval battles, court intrigue, and dragons is undisputedly a fantastic setting for a board game. Many publishers have created tie-ins with both the <em>Game of Thrones </em>TV show and the <em>Song of Ice and Fire </em>book series to bring the stories of Westeros to the game night table. Some of these iterations are quite good, and others are downright fantastic.</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">To celebrate the start of <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 this weekend, we’re counting down the best <em>Game of Thrones</em> card and board games. Each of these games is a fun way to transport yourself back to Westeros, without having to relive the pain of <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 8.</p> <h2 id="h-6-a-game-of-thrones-b-twixt" data-injectable="false"><strong><a href="https://geni.us/8esdum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>6.

You’ll need to collect a cast of iconic characters from the books for each of the two councils you have in your play space, which are in part shared with the players to your immediate right and left. The player with the most powerful small council wins the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-word-meeple-is-being-trademarked-in-the-us.901968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/word-meeple-is-being-trademarked-in-us<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The word meeple refers to a certain game piece in the tabletop community. A tiny, stylized, painted, wooden human-shaped figure. They can be used in worker placement games or even rolled in games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/meeple-rolling-board-game-rolling-heights-reaches-to-skies-of-kickstarter"><em>Rolling Heights</em></a>. And a German publisher is going to trademark the term in the US.</p>
<h2>The Meeple Trademark situation</h2>
<p>For context, the reason for the meeple trademark is due to a crowdfunding campaign. According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/06/14/the-word-meeple-is-being-trademarked-in-the-us-in-reaction-to-cease-and-desist-activity-from-carcassonne-publisher-hans-im-glueck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BoardGameWire</a>, a Gamefound campaign called <em>Meeple Inc.</em> was successfully funded in March. It was developed by Cogito Ergo Meeple and successfully raised about $230,000.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-inc-meeple-game-board-set-up.jpg?itok=am1vwwr7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-inc-meeple-game-board-set-up.jpg?itok=S0ZCmJqt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank goodness some slight changes in terms happened.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the game and the publisher has undergone rebranding. The project is now called <em>Tabletop Inc</em> and studio's new title is Cotswold Games. This is because they were sent a letter on the behalf of <em>Carcassonne</em> publisher Hans Im Glueck requesting the project be removed.</p>
<p>This is because Hans Im Glueck owns the German and European trademarks for the word meeple across various use cases. including the classic meeple figure from the 2000 release of <em>Carcassonne</em>.</p>
<p>Tabletop Inc,'s designers, Joe and Maddie Adams, wrote a campaign update about the meeple trademark stating they were, "a little surprised as the term is used so frequently in the hobby."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We thought Meeples belonged to all board gamers, it appears they don’t. We of course have zero interest in using anyone else’s IP so we think the best option is to do as they ask.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, whilst it creates a fair amount of work for us in the short term, this will not affect the game very much – all gameplay will remain exactly the same and the artwork will only be changed to replace the meeples with our new characters… Mumans.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation has lead to similar reactions in the greater tabletop community. It is a widely used term in the hobby and this trademark hasn't been heavily enforced in the past. As such, a US trademark application for the word meeple has been sent by Board Games Insider podcast co-host Corey Thompson and GenCon Event Manager Marian McBride.</p>
<p>Thompson went on record saying he and McBride have no plans to make any profit from doing this. Stating, "“The side effect of this is that we intend to protect the US trademark from predatory action. We would really love for the wordmark to be usable by anyone.”</p>
<p>Overall, it's a forward-thinking legal move. Over the years, dozens of board games have been released featuring the word meeple. Which means if Hans Im Glueck were to become more aggressive with enforcing their trademark, it could mean a lot of messy legal action in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/survival-fountain-of-youth-review-%E2%80%94-a-journey-through-a-timeless-legend.901965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/survival-fountain-of-youth-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tale of the fountain of youth is one passed down through the generations. Magical water that can stop and even reverse aging, allowing one to live forever. This is the foundational narrative for&nbsp;<em>Survival: Fountain of Youth.</em>&nbsp;Mixing the story of Juan Ponce de Leon with exploration focused quests and survival mechanics has produced an entertaining indie title.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Take to the Seas in<em> Survival: Fountain of Youth</em>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Washed ashore a small island after the destruction of your ship, you find yourself without any recent memory. Your aim is to travel throughout the four regions and reach the Bimini Belt where the fountain of youth is rumored to be hidden while tracking down the crews of the other two ships and Ponce de Leon.</p>
<p>Travelling throughout the regions you'll be managing hunger and thirst. This means finding fresh water and building ways to cook food. You'll also need to craft vessels capable of navigating between the islands and ultimately make it through the turbulent waters of the Bimini Belt.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-island-of-hope-statue.jpg?itok=agw3a4za 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-island-of-hope-statue.jpg?itok=ZkL7tV-n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The hardest part of surviving the islands is not dying to the creatures, especially if you don't focus on acquiring large amounts of ore to craft advanced weapons. Perfecting blocking helps, but ranged weapons are the way to prevent taking damage. Melee against crocodiles or bosses can quickly rack up the death count. With limited <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5f26e7e5-15f8-46f9-9955-1771d0b9e223" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-fountain-of-youth-living-water-locations-map-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Living Water</a> to remove max help debuffs, not dying in the first place is a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Quest Driven Narrative</h2>
<p>While there are survival and crafting mechanics in&nbsp;<em>Survival: Fountain of Youth,</em>&nbsp;they aren't the strongest part of the game. The quests and the lore they impart on the player are. Each quest reveals a part of Ponce de Leon's journey through the area in his quest for the fountain. They expand to the fates of your fellow sailors and launch a nefarious plot that you must unravel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the quests are the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1536a34d-cb93-427d-80e2-84225e3b86d1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-fountain-of-youth-chronicles-locations-map-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chronicles</a> hidden in each region. When found, each Chronicle details the history of the Bimini tribes and their fate. You even get to meet one member of the Snake Tribe towards the end of the game. These pieces of lore solidify the world you playing in.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-iron-island-chronicle.jpg?itok=m31jIMGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-iron-island-chronicle.jpg?itok=p3RBozNs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Unfortunately, since it is so quest-driven, additional playthroughs are heavily discounted. I couldn't see myself playing through the title a second time as the story has a definite ending, and any surprise the plot threw at you are no longer impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Base building in <em>Survival: Fountain of Youth</em> is sparse, with decor primarily centered on hunting trophies and some nautical items. Personally, it doesn't provide enough of a draw for repeated playthroughs. What kept me going through the game to reach the end was the want to find out who you're actually playing as and if the fountain is real.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the lack of creative base mechanics, there's really no innovation when it comes to crafting. You have a smoker and a campfire, a tanner, and farms. While there are game-specific crafters, such as the saltpeter, there's nothing unique about the implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-alcohol-crafting-recipe.jpg?itok=V8ANU-aR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-alcohol-crafting-recipe.jpg?itok=fJ1dWxGx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Survival: Fountain of Youth</em>&nbsp;presents a compelling narrative, it's a standard survival crafting game that borders on an RPG. The story is well executed and entertaining, but many of the title's mechanics offer nothing new to the genre. After an initial playthrough, while being provided many hours of entertainment, I wouldn't be amenable to a second save.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Survival: Fountain of Youth is a creative take of the story of Juan Ponce de Leon, but more RPG than survival crafting game. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

Exotic missions have come and gone to much acclaim, such as The Whisper and Zero Hour (which returned to the game via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918"><em>Into The Ligh</em></a></span><em>t </em>some months ago), but Dual Destiny is the first one to have a real gimmick outside of a timer and some light puzzling. Dual Destiny can only be completed by two players, requires them to adorn certain subclasses—one Dark, one Light—and demands a certain amount of communication. The reward at the end is pretty significant: an Exotic class item that can roll multiple perks, including ones previously accessible via class-specific equipment, meaning <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-subclass-prismatic-dread-1851398657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-subclass-prismatic-dread-1851398657">classes can now share abilities</a></span> with one another.</p><p>That’s a pretty game-changing incentive to complete what appears at first glance like a neat, but missable mission, and players are a bit incensed about the requirements to acquire such a transformative piece of equipment. Fans of <em>Destiny 2</em> have gotten upset about secret Exotic missions like this before, because of their difficulty or the timed nature of them, but the ire around Dual Destiny is entirely different. There’s a guaranteed way to make the mission appear , meaning you can only miss out on it by failing to commit to the process, at which point you should know what you’re getting into.. Folks who play <em>Destiny 2 </em>simply don’t want to have to do this mission with another player in order to get the Exotic class item, and they’ve been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ddwyub/i_love_the_dual_destiny_mission_itself_but_i_feel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ddwyub/i_love_the_dual_destiny_mission_itself_but_i_feel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very loud about it</a></span>.<br></p><p>I totally understand disgruntled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-server-error-offline-1851523773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-server-error-offline-1851523773">solo players</a></span>. I’ve been playing <em>Destiny </em>for all ten years it’s been around, and I’ve largely played the game solo. I’ve never had a <em>Destiny </em>static (a reliable group of folks to play with) and probably won’t for a while still. There are six-player raids and three-man dungeons I <em>still </em>haven’t completed, and yes, I’m occasionally upset about the fact that I haven’t been able to experience some of the game’s best content due to lacking a fireteam. Even now, I’m not stoked that such a pivotal item is locked behind a quest I need to find someone else to complete, but believe it or not folks, this is not Bungie’s problem. It’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/rocketbiscuits/status/1800942292041072859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/rocketbiscuits/status/1800942292041072859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mine, or yours</a></span>.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>has always been a multiplayer-first game. Even if large chunks of it can be completed solo, it’s entirely valid for the developer of a <em>multiplayer</em> title to make content specifically for audiences to engage with it on those terms. I don’t think the game needs to cater to an audience that wants to turn it into something it isn’t.</p><p>Not to mention, <em>Destiny</em>, as well as its community, have largely circumvented the issue at the heart of this situation. There are numerous forums and Discords where people can meet other players to play with. Over the years, I’ve met at least a couple of friends through <em>Destiny </em>like this. Nowadays, there’s a full-fledged system in the game called Fireteam Finder that allows you to make or search for posts in lieu of matchmaking, and while it’s far from perfect, it is largely functional. Find a lone player, get on the mic for about half an hour to communicate some puzzles to one another, and then complete the mission and move on. It is actually as simple as that. It is a mission like any other, and when there’s a challenge in front of you, the goal is to overcome it.</p><p>As someone who’s got anxiety about playing games with literally anyone other than the friends I’ve played with for years, I understand how engaging in these systems may be asking a lot of certain folks. I’m sympathetic to the person who’s riddled with second thoughts and doubts about putting themselves out there, but I’m also not going to enable them to remain closed off. Nor am I going to join the chorus of players demanding that missions like Dual Destiny never be made in the first place because it chafes against what they believe should be allowed.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>has always excelled when it’s pushed itself and the people who play it. Without the kind of experimentation on display in Dual Destiny, we wouldn’t have much of its best content, which includes the numerous secret Exotic missions over the years, every Raid, and the game’s dungeons, which are my personal favorite. We wouldn’t have all of the community-based ARGs that the <em>Destiny </em>community has been privy to over the years. There’s simply so much we’d be missing if Bungie didn’t occasionally ask its players to come together for unique experiences. My advice is to lean into it the few times it happens. I don’t think you’ll regret it.</p><p>Inevitably, Bungie will introduce an alternative way of getting the Exotic class items that isn’t tied to Dual Destiny. This was never going to be the <em>only </em>method to get them, it was just an interesting and novel way to handle things, while also testing the functionality of Bungie’s new services and the willingness of its community. It’s been heartening watching folks give it a try despite hang ups and disabilities, such as some Guardians who are either <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1de3dq6/fellow_mute_guardians_you_can_complete_dual/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1de3dq6/fellow_mute_guardians_you_can_complete_dual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mute</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dec81o/dual_destiny_is_genuinely_great_fun_and_highly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dec81o/dual_destiny_is_genuinely_great_fun_and_highly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deaf</a></span>. Though the <em>Destiny </em>community can be as toxic as any, seeing many offer to carry communication-averse players, or those who simply aren’t comfortable with the more involved mechanics of the encounter, is a reminder that these communal experiences <em>are </em>worth having in these games.<br></p><p>I hope Bungie takes that to heart. I’ve no doubt there’s reasonable criticism to be made about Dual Destiny, but its existence is actually one of the best things about games like <em>Destiny 2</em>. It is hardly a problem that needs expunging. Rather, it’s a promise of what the game can look like when it and its team are allowed to fire on all cylinders, and continue to create novel experiences for this community all these years later.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="398" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Yacht Club has announced as part of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ysyNfkYWGW4?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yacht Club Presents stream</a> that they’ll be releasing what is intended to be the definitive edition of the retro-inspired classic, <em>Shovel Knight</em>. <em>Shovel Knight Shovel of Hope DX</em> doesn’t have a solid release date yet, but it’s being announced the celebrate its anniversary. Let me just take a sip of tea while I read what anniversary it is. <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shovel-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ten years</a>!?</em></p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">That’s right, <em>Shovel Knight </em>was first released in June of 2014, back while I was still spritely and youthful. 10 years later, it’s still one of the best retro-inspired games you can find, a tribute to the <em>Mega Man </em>series with plenty of style of its own. It received DLC expansions over the years, as well as spin-offs such as <em>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbpEXPSvFtc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><em>Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</em> will feature 20 playable characters and “fan-favorite features from all previous versions of the game,” including Challenge Stages, Custom Knight, and the Battle Ghost Arena. It will be adding modern retro conveniences such as save states, rewind, and online multiplayer functionality. Finally, there will be 300 “gameplay-twisting” cheats to change things up or make them weird.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">One thing I’m not clear on is if this version will be included for people who own the all-encompassing Treasure Trove edition. The Yacht Club Presents stream mentions that the original version is on sale now. Except for Steam, Xbox One, and PS4, which should be soon.</p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">Either way, their intention is for it to be their “way of preserving the game’s historical functionality, ensuring these elements remain available for future generations of players.”</p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false"><em>Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</em> will be coming to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC sometime soon.</p>

The E3 replacement included multiple online showcases and onsite events, each aimed at drumming up excitement for a flood of upcoming games. Which games rocked? Which ones sucked? Which ones will become video game industry touchstones while the rest fade from memory? We tried to play as many of them as we could to find out.<br></p><p>After flying back from LA, throwing all our dirty laundry in the corner, and passing out, we started gathering every single game we got a chance to actually go hands-on with during Summer Game Fest, from <em>Marvel Rivals</em> to <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, and all of the indies in-between. In some cases, we only got mere minutes with the the games as their developers and brand managers pitched us on what made them great. But for other games, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, we were able to roam new worlds at our leisure and chew on them for a while. </p><p>We saw loud monster truck races, real-time strategy battles, Souls-likes, sidescrollers, hotly anticipated <em>Overwatch</em> knockoffs, and much, much more. Every game we got a chance to try out is here for your perusal, along with details on where they’ll launch and when. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC </p><p>Amazon Games’ <em>New World</em> has had an interesting few years. Billed as an MMORPG and launched in 2021 on PC, it’s now being repackaged and re-released as <em>New World: Aeternum </em>for a console drop. Weirdly, Amazon is also shifting the marketing approach for <em>New World: Aeternum</em>: it has all of the base game material, the <em>Rise of the Angry Earth e</em>xpansion, and a slew of new content—and the team is calling it an RPG, not an MMO, even though it’s still an MMO. Yes, I am also confused.</p><p><em>Aeternum</em> clearly wants to court new players while also attempting to not alienate the exist fan base, but I’m not sure how well this will work out. My hands-on was fairly brief, but showed off the new story content and new characters. At first, the RPG elements were obvious—there’s a cool story at play here, your build can be varied, your approach diverse, but then after getting through the on-boarding process, it hard-pivots back to an MMO. And a kind of boring one at that.</p><p>If you already play <em>New World</em>, you won’t be annoyed by the tedious crafting and leveling that comes standard with an MMO. But if you haven’t (and that’s clearly who Amazon is trying to court here), why the hell would you sign up for an RPG just to play this? If the full game launch is more fleshed out in terms of solo gameplay that isn’t as tedious, <em>New World: Aeternum </em>could be a solid RPG. We’ll have to wait and see. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Early Access July 30</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>If you loved <em>StarCraft II</em> you’ll probably like <em>Stormgate</em>, a real-time strategy revival project led by some ex-Blizzard developers. It’s free-to-play with an emphasis on 1v1 competitive modes, though additional content and campaign missions will be available in the paid version. The team recently revealed its third faction called the Celestials which turn the traditional resource extraction, base expansion, army creation loop on its head due to an intricate set of mechanics that allow players to explore, expand, and attack all at once.</p><p>I was able to demo the game ahead of the event and chat with the team at Summer Game Fest and it looks good and plays great. I’m still not sold on if it can break out beyond the hardcore, esports-minded crowd it’s initially pitched at, but it’s snappy, matches are quick, and I’m excited to play more. I never got into <em>StarCraft</em> but love the genre, and have been on the hunt for an old-school RTS that can fill that void in my life. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> fans, we are so back. After playing half a dozen matches against AI-opponents, I can’t wait to get my hands on <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and relive all of my favorite DBZ highs and lows while getting ultra sweaty online, if the netcode allows it. It sucks that local versus is limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber but it’s better than none at all. I have a sneaking suspicion that I’ll find plenty of things to complain about once I’ve spent dozens of hours with the finished game, but that’s also part of the <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> legacy. A flawless series it was not, but what I saw of <em>Sparking Zero </em>made it feel like Bandai Namco is serious about making it more than just a next-gen nostalgia cash-in. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>Hands-On: Shaping Up To Be The <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3 </em>Sequel Fans Deserve</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 29, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>The newest game in the <em>Monster Jam </em>series, <em>Showdown</em> is exactly what it says on the label: you drive around massive monster trucks across several different game modes and three major locations. There are 1v1 races, traditional multi-truck races, and a destruction mode that rewards you for—you guessed it—demolishing shit.</p><p>During my Summer Game Fest hands-on, I struggled a bit with steering my monster truck, and flipped over <em>a lot</em>. Luckily, there’s a simple “respawn” button that blinks you back a few feet and sits you upright, but I did not do well in any of my races because I couldn’t keep the damn thing from tipping over. I was told that I could use the right joystick to better control my truck, as <em>Showdown</em> has independent suspension, but that just made me even wobblier.</p><p>I can see <em>Monster Jam Showdown</em> being a fun game to pick up and play with friends while having a few brewskis, and for fans of the series, this will probably satisfy them, but this isn’t really my jam. Teehee. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>TBD (beta this summer)</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>Battle Aces</em> is another RTS led by ex-Blizzard developers. You might have caught it during the Summer Game Fest showcase where it debuted with a flashy anime trailer that set many viewers up for crushing disappointment when the words “real-time strategy” eventually followed. But <em>Battle Aces</em> isn’t your standard RTS. It’s much closer to something like <em>Clash Royale</em>, the mobile deck-building tower-defense game.</p><p>In<em> Battle Aces</em> you unlock new units, build a “deck” out of the ones you want,” and then go into battle against opponents on a super small map where matches are only expected to take about five minutes or so. Resource extraction is all automated outside of investing in a limited set of additional base nodes, and building units is almost instantaneous. Where the strategy comes in is trying to counter-play against your opponent’s army, capitalize on big swings to cripple their resource extraction, and incrementally build up advantages until you crush their final base <em>Dota-2</em> style. As with <em>Stormgate</em>, competitive play isn’t where my RTS love lies, but<em> Battle Aces </em>felt approachable and low commitment enough to peak my interest once it’s out. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date</strong>: July 19, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, PC</p><p>I love tower defense. I love Capcom action games. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> combines the two into a Japanese folklore-inspired adventure where you guide a maiden from one demonic gate to another across a mountain until all of the evil spirits have been banished. It was one of the best demos I played at Summer Game Fest, and luckily most players won’t have to take a risk on buying it to find out what’s so special about it since it’s coming to Game Pass. As someone who put dozens of hours into the original <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>, I’m so glad tower defense sickos are about to get what feels like a big-budget action strategy game with some of the visual flair of <em>Okami</em>. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can't Wait To Return To&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can't Wait To Return To"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</em> Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can’t Wait To Return To</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>I am very much not an RTS person, so perhaps I won’t do <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>justice, and for that, I’m sorry. But even I can understand the excitement around <em>Retold</em>’s release, as it’s finally bringing back a 22-year-old RTS classic with modern graphics, improved mechanics, and a chance to fight through Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons. And instead of having just swords, shields, spears, and other typical classic RTS weapons to fight with, you’ll get some sick powers as well: Zeus’ lightning, a barrage of meteors, dragons, centaurs, crocodiles, cyclops—you name it, <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>probably has it.</p><p>During my playthrough, I quickly picked up on some of the hotkeys to make this RTS really sing, like selecting the entirety of my troops in one click so I could direct them to destroy an enemy stronghold, or pressing F3 to heal everyone in the vicinity. There is a zen-like appeal to RTS games that my hands-on has allowed me to understand, and I zone out almost immediately. Before I know it, the preview is over. A rep for the dev team said that the goal with <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>was to attract non-RTS players, and it could very well do that—it’s available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Series X/S and PC. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 16 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I played<em> Flock</em> for about 15 minutes and in that time I discovered six new specimens of exotic indie game creatures and managed to get four of them to follow me back to my quest giver. Think <em>Pokémon Snap </em>mixed with a chill flight sim. I’m not sure how much deeper the game will go, but I enjoyed spotting new, weird little animals and guessing what they were based on their appearance and behaviors. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em> is a game about taking pictures, I think. It doesn’t really tell you want to do, which is good because I was happy to just spend my time walking around mountain paths like I was on a hike. There’s an incredible soundtrack of chill licensed tracks that made me feel oddly meditative. The first-person view made me a little motion sick, but I did not expect any of my demos at Summer Game Fest to lead me down a trippy trance of existential reflection. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>TBD</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I did not like <em>Bounty Star</em> at all for the first eight minutes or so, which involved a tutorial of walking around a ranch following glowing markers and making items like I was trapped inside a survival crafting sim. Then I got into an actual mech and fought through my first mission and fell in love with the crunch robot combat. Getting hit felt a little wishy-washy and there’s a lot of room to improve on the overall look and level of polish, but I could definitely see getting hooked on a <em>Borderlands</em>-style loot loop of blowing up bandits and customizing my mech. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Early 2025</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Mac</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is like <em>Overwatch</em> if it snorted a line of adderall off the TTRPG table in a comic book store. The free-to-play superhero PvP shooter aims to fill a gap left by Blizzard’s struggling hero shooter, and boasts a massive cast that will only get bigger, but it’s unclear if this will strike the right cord. There are so many aspects of this that feel directly lifted from <em>Overwatch</em>—Doctor Strange wields a shield like Reinhardt, The Punisher has a turret form like Bastion, Luna Snow can send heals across the map to a single teammate like Zenyatta. Hell, even the modes are similar, with opposing teams either fighting to maintain control over an area or one squad attempting to escort a hi-pri mobile object across a map.</p><p>But there is just <em>so much going on</em> that it’s immediately overwhelming. The roster is huge, the voice lines are constant, the colorful explosions and flashes of light as every Marvel hero fires off their abilities makes matches hard to read with all the visual noise. I only had a little bit of time with <em>Rivals</em> (back-to-back Summer Game Fest appointments that almost all run over make for an intense experience), but it took me more than half of my appointment to get a feel for everything. By the time I did, I was quite good at Luna Snow, who felt like the perfect character for me, a perpetual support player (though I did notice that NetEase and Marvel Games had to scrape the bottom of the hero barrel for a solid support character, as Luna was introduced into Marvel canon via the mobile game <em>Marvel Future Fight</em>).</p><p>I’m not sure if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will have any legs. <em>Overwatch </em>has, indeed, left a gap in the hero shooter market, but <em>Rivals</em> feels clunkier, busier, and less inspired than Blizzard’s hero shooter once was. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>If you liked <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, don’t sleep on<em> Robots at Midnight</em>. It’s another action-RPG Souls-lite that takes the edge off punishing combat with cartoony robot enemies and a whimsical world. In addition to the standard stamina bar and dodge roll, there’s also an air dash that lets you quickly retreat from combat. I still got my ass-kicked, especially at night when, as the title implies, the stakes ramp up with extra and tougher enemies. I enjoyed what I played and it’s definitely on my radar now. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Sky of Tides</em> is a narrative-driven sci-fi game where you try to navigate a world torn apart by revolutionary politics and heal its divides. There’s a slick-looking series of animated shorts attached to it that expand on the story, while the game itself was described to me by one of its developers as an “anti-RPG.” Instead of trying to min-max stats and role-play as a particular character, your aim is to progress by building stats and choosing dialogue responses that help your character grow in a balanced way. It’s an interesting idea though I’m not sure how compelling it will be in practice. Still, it’s the most interesting approach to subverting the traditional CRPG structure I’ve heard of since <em>Disco Elysium</em>. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>What if <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was a survival crafting game that looked (even more) like <em>Princess Mononoke</em>? You might get something like <em>Fera: The Sundered Tribes</em>, a gorgeous and ambitious looking sandbox monster fighter where you can hookshot and paraglide around a massive map. It’s a huge pivot from Massive Damage’s last game, the pixel-art strategy roguelite, <em>Star Renegade</em>. The world looked really cool even if the game felt a bit messy to control at times and very chaotic during boss fights. It’s a tall order for the studio to pull off, but if it can it could be a really fascinating addition to the exploding (and quickly overheating) survival crafting genre. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I’m by no means an old-school <em>Fatal Fury</em> head or a  fighting game aficionado but I liked what I played of <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>. Like, a lot. It’s definitely not as approachable as <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, but it certainly feels like that’s where part of SNK’s attention is in brining the direct sequel to 1999's <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em> into the world of 3D animations. There’s even a new simpler control scheme you can select that makes pulling off super moves a lot easier, even if some of the full-gage attacks are still locked behind some intricate manual button presses. </p><p>A lot of the tactics revolve around cancelable “Rev” moves and defensive advances that make City of the Wolves reward skilled and cautious play. Mostly I just had a ton of fun beating up on CPU opponents as Preecha, a brand-new addition to the SNK roster and a  Muay Thai fighter who brings a bubblier energy to the brooding dude-fest. Everyone should have “their” fighting game and I think I’m not determined to make <em>Fatal Fury </em>mine. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 19, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, PC</p><p>I will admit to approaching this hands-on with a heavy amount of bias. <em>Enotria</em> is an Italian folklore-inspired Soulslike from a small team of nine people based in Milan, Italy, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/colin-farrell-penguin-show-hbox-max-set-pics-1850213829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/colin-farrell-penguin-show-hbox-max-set-pics-1850213829">I love Italian shit</a></span>. </p><p>I spent about half an hour with <em>Enotria</em>, and boy, did I struggle. The developer on-hand promised me that the team will be making it more accessible for launch, as it absolutely whooped my ass, but I enjoyed every second of it. The beautifully vibrant, over-the-top world and all its Italian influences (from the music to the bosses, like the multi-faced, batshit worshiper Vermiglio the Red Prior) were a delight to behold, even if I had to get help beating every one of the demo’s bosses.</p><p>And while <em>Enotria</em> feels and behaves a lot like a <em>Souls</em> game, Jyamma Games has gone to great lengths to add layers of customization that might surprise you. You can set up three loadouts and swap between them on the fly and apply aspects to the masks you wear that will adjust your stats and give you certain buffs and debuffs. There’s a lot going on under the hood here, which is really impressive considering how small the dev team is! — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> has never looked so good or featured Shadow as a playable character. That’s the long and short of my take-away from the remaster of the PS3/Xbox 360 era action platformer. I will say that the linear 3D spin on the speedster’s traditional formula has aged remarkably well, and feels focused and even somewhat fresh in comparison to a lot of the genre-scrambling bloat we sometimes see these days. Game was good. Game still good. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Switch, Mobile (Netflix exclusive), PC</p><p>No gaming expo is complete without that one puzzle game that lowkey scrambles your brain and blows your mind after just a few minutes with it. For me this year that was <em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em>, a beautifully illustrated top-down adventure where you maneuver through mazes by sliding their tilesets. It’s simple at first, but the gimmick quickly reveals clever tricks and unexpected challenges. It was made by a surprisingly large team of over a dozen people, one of whom was the artist on indie darling <em>Braid</em>. There’s a bit of how <em>Crypt of the Necrodancer</em> was remixing<em> Zelda </em>for music junkies, except this time around it’s puzzle logic sickos who are benefiting. It was another one of my top demos from Summer Game Fest. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 16, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>This is probably the most beautiful game I played at Summer Game Fest. Animated with a lithographic style and set music that oozes neo-noir vibes, <em>Phoenix Springs </em>has you point-and-clicking through objects in the environment for clues about your missing brother. As a reporter, you try to tease out information from strangers and uncover the tools needed to progress by chaining together nouns. Instead of building up an inventory of stuff, you collect ideas that can be combined to initiate new interactions or strings of dialogue that advance the plot. As someone who doesn’t really gel with point-and-click adventure games, I wish there was another way to play through <em>Phoenix Springs</em>’ world and story, but both of them were irresistible enough that I am going to struggle through it regardless when it eventually comes out. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><em>Replaced</em> is an ‘80s homage that feels like <em>The Lost Boys </em>met <em>The Warriors</em> in an arcade cabinet. The 2.5D cyberpunk platformer tells the story of R.E.A.C.H., an AI that was trapped in a human body and is now on the run through a dystopian world marred by corruption and littered with outlaws. I didn’t get a huge taste of what <em>Replaced</em>’s combat will be like in my half-hour demo (I got a gun towards the end of my playthrough, which I could charge up by using my melee ability to whack baddies), but I was immediately entranced by its set-dressing.</p><p>Though <em>Replaced</em>’s graphics are hyper-pixelated and decidedly retro, small details like flickering light particles, incredible audio design, and seamless transitions from side-scrolling movement to animated cutscenes adds a slightly modern twist. At one point, when I’m prompted to access my inventory, the camera zooms in on R.E.A.C.H.’s back and then through it for a tight shot of his “Wingman,” an obvious spin on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walkman retro music player</a></span>. This game is <em>beautiful</em> from top to bottom, and my brief demo left me wanting a whole lot more. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 18, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>UFO50</em> is the latest game from <em>Spelunky</em> maker Mossmouth and one fans have been waiting a while for. The title refers to a collection of 50 retro-inspired games built from the ground up to look and feel like a library of long-lost NES cartridges. I tried to flip through as many as possible in my short 10 minutes with the game, and found an RPG in the vein of<em> Dragon Quest</em>, a beat-em-up reminiscent of <em>Double Dragon</em>, and a space golfing game that is unlike anything I’ve played before.</p><p>There’s local co-op and a meta-story that runs through each game about the fictional company that made them. None of the ones I came across seemed like something I might end up spending hours playing, but I’m excited to dig into the full collection and pretend I’m back in my neighbor’s basement grinding through the same five games we had lying around over and over again because we were too poor to buy more. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2025</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>While Waiting</em> is what it says on the tin. The game is on a timer and will automatically move along from one day-in-the-life-style vignette to another. What you do while waiting for each new scene to arrive is up to you. Most of it consists of making messes, annoying people, or making up imaginary games to play with yourself like pretending your finger is a spaceship dodging asteroids as you move it along a window pain as rain drops run down it. It’s a clever idea with a perfectly suited visual style and lots of hidden achievements to collect. — Ethan<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 5, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>People have been waiting a very long time for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-s-delay-is-personally-painful-because-1848362882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-s-delay-is-personally-painful-because-1848362882"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>.</a></span> The immersive FPS from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-russia-invasion-ukraine-release-date-delay-1849061092&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-russia-invasion-ukraine-release-date-delay-1849061092">Ukrainian studio GSC Game World</a></span> was delayed in 2022, when the team had to flee their country after it came under siege by Russia. Making a game is already incredibly difficult, now try making one the midst of an invasion. After several delays, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>is set to launch this fall, and I got a chance to try out a demo build at Summer Game Fest. Though my build wouldn’t let me invert my Y-axis and I embarrassed myself in front of Phil Spencer (who was behind me while I wheeled the camera about wildly trying to unlearn years of inversion-brain), it’s clear that GSC has made something special.</p><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>looks incredible. The game world is incredibly dark, not so much so that you can’t clearly see where you’re going, but just enough that the bizarre electrical anomalies chasing you through a sewer will overwhelm you and make a scary situation even more terrifying. Then there’s the resource management, which you’ll quickly learn is crucial if you’re going to make it through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Enemies are smart and painful, ammo dwindles fast, radiation poisoning stacks quickly, and you can very easily get over-encumbered with shit. You need to have your head on straight to succeed in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2</em>, as it offers a level of immersive FPS that surprised me. This game is going to be brutally fun when it launches in the fall, and it’s an instant cop for me (though it’ll be day one on Xbox Game Pass). — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Q3 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC</p><p><em>After Love EP</em> is an adventure game where your dead girlfriend talks to you as you explore and try to recover from the grief of her passing. There’s rhythm gameplay when you’re jamming with your band, which I didn’t get to play, but the other part of the game is navigating conversations with friends and the daily toil of living in a beautiful, bustling part of Jakarta, Indonesia. The game is partly a tribute to <em>Coffee Talk</em> creator Mohammad Fahmi, and based on his work before passing away at the age of 32 a couple years ago. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Q1 2025<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>Play as a house, roll around lo-fi PS1-looking environments, flirt with other buildings.

The part I like best is how all of the dialogue feels like someone downloaded their messiest group chats and text message threads and boiled them down into the funniest moments. It’s deeply personal but with the breezy nonchalance of a modern online dating profile. Boozayaangool said it’s about two hours and was partly inspired by the brief meditative journey<em> A Short Hike</em>. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 29, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>fans, rejoice, <em>Akimbot</em> is coming later this summer and bringing with it a whole shoebox full of love letters addressed to the PlayStation platformer. Evil Raptor, the team behind the <em>MediEvil</em>-inspired <em>Pumpkin Jack</em>, has proven once again that they can take a winning formula, replicate it, and add some extra toppings to sweeten the deal. <em>Akimbot</em> follows two robots, Exe and Shipset, who have just escaped the clutches of the Roboglioni mafia family and are on the run from the very Italian-coded ‘bots (they even wear funny little old-school hats).</p><p>The platforming is incredibly fluid and seamless, with a double-jump and dash allowing you to move through the beachy environment with relative ease. It’s simplistic, but effective, and the level design feels like it’s gently nudging you in a direction rather than strapping you to rails. Combat is similarly simple: Exe can melee enemies with a blade, shoot them with an AR, and pick from one of four special attacks from a merchant I encountered almost immediately in my demo. You’ll need some firepower here, too, as one set piece where a giant, turreted ship rained hell down upon me was quite difficult.</p><p><em>Akimbot </em>is fast and fun, and feels like the perfect game for <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>fans looking for some light platforming, fluid combat, and an unlikely duo leading the way. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Late 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p><em>Shantae</em> maker Wayforward has teamed up with Atari to bring back <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>, a 1980s space shooter that was one of the best selling games on the Atari 2600. <em>Yars Risin</em>g tries to build that out into a <em>Mega Man Zero</em>-style action platformer with hacking mini-games (the developers really didn’t want me to call them that) where you complete challenges modeled after the gameplay of the original. It’s a neat homage that I didn’t feel any particular attachment to, especially because the presentation of <em>Yars Rising</em> feels quite distinct from its ‘80s source material. It certainly doesn’t seem like a bad game but I’d need more time with it to have a sense of whether it’s more than just a competent exercise in brand revival. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 6, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>was hands-down the best thing I played at Summer Game Fest. It is more<em> Astro Bot</em>, but it is not <em>only</em> more <em>Astro Bot</em>. I recently described it to someone as PlayStation’s version of a Nintendo game except that unlike a lot of those it doesn’t feel like it was trying to copy anyone’s homework. The platforming is tight, the secrets on each level are delightful, and challenge levels made me sweat just enough to want to keep coming back. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387">Hands-On With <em>Astro Bot</em>: Pure Joy</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Holiday 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Switch, PC</p><p>If you’ve played one of the many recent licensed Lego games you’ll know exactly what to expect from <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>. It’s retelling the events of the <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in a slightly different and much funnier way, and prioritizes two-player co-op with streamlined controls and straightforward combat. It reminded me a lot of <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em>, which is excellent. Hopefully there’s enough meat on the <em>Horizon Adventures</em> bone to make it feel similarly fulfilling. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713">Hands-On With Horizon Lego Adventures: A Perfect Fit For Nintendo Switch</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 30, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5</p><p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894">hands-on with Ubisoft’s upcoming open-world game, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span>. I hoped that it would showcase a beautiful <em>Star Wars</em> world, and that it would play nothing like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>—and I was pleasantly surprised. Though my demo was on rails, it’s clear that there will be a variety of gameplay options and features at protagonist Kay Vess’ disposal, from blaster gunfights to stealth options to leaning on her sidekick, Nix, to distract Stormtroopers or fetch objects. There’s hacking, lock picking, dogfights in space, sabacc matches, and more.<br></p><p>The world Ubisoft has crafted is steeped in reverence for George Lucas’ galaxy, and Kay is a fantastic protagonist, a loveable scoundrel who feels rooted in <em>Star Wars</em>’ seedy criminal underbelly. I wish I could have gotten a feel for just how open this game will be when it launches later this summer, but from what I did get a taste of, I am hungry for more. — Alyssa</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Hands-On: Good Gameplay, Wonderful World</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>June 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch<br></p><p>What can I say? It’s more <em>Super Monkey Ball,</em> folks, just with a lot of additional bells and whistles this time around. The game did not visually look that great running on Switch, though maybe that’s because it was blown up on a massive Samsung TV. The gameplay was decent and I never felt like I was slipping off stages or floating in the air for too long (the Sega rep told me there was a conscious effort to make the controls weightier this time around following some complaints about the recent remaster of the original games).</p><p>Did I mention you can play as Sonic? He, Knuckles, and the rest of the gang are part of a season pass players can pick up to expand their roster of characters, and a lot of the push behind the game seems to be inspired by things like<em> Fall Guys</em>, including a multiplayer mode featuring 16-player activities. There’s also a spin-dash move this time around that lets you store up momentum and fling your monkey around like a pinball. It was perfect for trying to cheese levels. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Fall 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Mac</p><p>This ‘90s-inspired low-fi horror game from a two-person development team (Cozy Game Pals) was so vibey when it first launched, Blumhouse Games noticed it and offered money to expand upon it. <em>Fear The Spotlight</em> will return to Steam (and other platforms), later this year, and if you’re interested in vibey, VHS-quality visuals and creepy liminal spaces, I highly recommend it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fear-the-spotlight-blumhouse-horror-game-hands-on-1851528992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fear-the-spotlight-blumhouse-horror-game-hands-on-1851528992">My hands-on with <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> </a></span>was an incredibly gripping and satisfying experience, like playing through an old point-and-click PC game with a throwback <em>Resident Evil </em>twist.

The S-Game project promising a 30 hour campaign with tons of different weapons and exploration looks years away still, but what I played much more like a PS3-era action game. Cool combos and flashy animations, complete with long range attacks and parrying. It didn’t blow me but I’m interested to see what the rest of the game ends up looking like once it exists. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 11, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC</p><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>wasn’t quite what I was expecting. I went into my demo thinking it would have more real-time action flavor, but it is very much <em>Persona</em> in a fantasy setting. There’s a calendar system and social interactions to build deeper relationships with your party (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">but no romances</a></span>), and transformations in battle to cast spells or use extra powerful attacks that feel a lot like summoning <em>Persona</em> in suits of armor.</p><p>You can perform attacks out in the world, but only against weaker enemies. The stronger ones still require a familiar turn-based battle to defeat. None of this is bad. In fact, with <em>Persona 6</em> nowhere in sight at the moment, Atlus RPG fans are lucky to have something so meaty and stylish to dive into this fall. I was just hoping to see the formula shaken up more. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> plays like a great, if conservative, <em>Persona </em>spiritual spin-off. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 8, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p>The newest side-scrolling robot tactics game from Thunderful Development was my final appointment at Summer Game Fest 2024. I felt completely dead while sinking back into the blue couch I was sitting on for the demo, but not so dead that I didn’t immediately get stoked for the new possibilities coming in the sequel. The first <em>SteamWorld Heis</em>t was XCOM in 2D, with players lining up ricocheting bullets and collecting rewards from surviving successful battles.</p><p><em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em> doesn’t change what’s not broken, but it does add some big twists. There’s now overworld exploration via a submarine you can upgrade and battle other ocean enemies with in real-time. Each character can also train in various classes and share abilities between them similar to the job systems popularized in Final Fantasy Tactics and other strategy RPGs. The result seems like a much deeper tactical experience that I’m really looking forward to checking out the full version of when it drops later this summer. — Ethan</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can also opt to turn off <strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong> or <strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong>, but <strong>I’d personally leave these on</strong>. There’s no compelling performance gains by disabling them.</p><p>That said, <strong>if you have the Steam Deck hooked up to a Monitor or TV, you can increase the game’s resolution to enjoy some superior visuals</strong>. To do this, before you select the “Play” option on the game’s main page, press <strong>the Cog icon</strong> on the right side of the screen (pictured above), then select <strong>Properties &gt; General &gt; Game Resolution</strong>. Here you can manually select what resolution the game will launch in, even if it’s past the Steam Deck’s default resolution. <strong>The resolution in-game needs to match whatever you select here, so make sure to review the Graphics settings in the Options menu to make sure everything is in order.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-recommend-id="image://c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-recommend-id="image://c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Based on my testing experience, here’s how the game runs at the following resolutions:</p><p><strong>1368 X 768</strong>: This is, for the most part, just a clean visual upgrade. The game typically ran between 55 - 60 FPS, and did not meaningfully dip below 50. It’s not a big graphical boost, but it’s “free” if you’re on a TV.</p><p><strong>1600 X 900</strong>: I found this to be a good, balanced option. The game typically maintained a resolution above 50 FPS, with only an occasional dip below that. If you’re not particularly sensitive to frame rate issues, this should look good and feel smooth.</p><p><strong>1920 X 1080</strong>: Believe it or not, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>generally runs okay at 1920 X 1080! You’ll spend more time in the 40 FPS range, with occasional drops below that. However, the game was still perfectly playable and never dipped below 30.</p><p><strong>I personally preferred playing at 1600 X 900</strong>, but your mileage may vary. Some areas of the game may be more taxing than others, so you may need to adjust the resolution depending on where you’re at. Either way, the Steam Deck’s performance is leaps and bounds superior to the Nintendo Switch version, so keep that in mind as you select which version of the game you’d wish to play. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware is preparing to bring players the highly anticipated first and last DLC for Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, on June 21, 2024. Just a week before the DLC drops, the developers have announced an exciting upcoming patch that will introduce new features for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, along with bug fixes and balance adjustments. The latest patch will be released on June 20, with server maintenance scheduled for 7:00 to 10:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An update to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> base game &amp; a day 1 patch for Shadow of the Erdtree will be distributed on 6/20.<br>The update includes bug fixes, balance adjustements &amp; some new features.</p><p>A server maintenance to apply the update will be conducted on 6/20 from 07:00 to 10:00 UTC.<br>(1/4)</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1801616168299499599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree patch is designed with players in mind, introducing inventory features to help you better manage your items. Any new item you obtain will be marked with a ‘!’ so you can spot them more easily on the menu. Also, a new tab called ‘Recent Items’ will be available for all your recently acquired items to sit.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the new Summoning Pool features, players have received more control over the tools. Active Summoning Pools are now available in New Game Plus. In the upcoming patch, you will be able to enable or disable individual summoning pools through the new Map Functions Menu. Lastly, the Small Golden Effigy will allow you to select only Active Summoning Pools.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree patch will bring exciting new customization options for players. Among these additions are five fresh hairstyles that will be made available. These new styles can be accessed through the character creation section using either the Clouded Mirror Stand or Rennala’s Rebirth feature. Furthermore, FromSoftware has announced that they will introduce even more features as the update nears its release.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Back in March, SNK finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-makes-a-strong-case-for-the-series-return-after-25-years/1100-6521905/">pulled back the curtain</a> on Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves, the latest installment in the storied fighting game franchise. The return 24 years in the making impressed with its American comic-style art, hard-hitting action, and unique fighting mechanics like the S.P.G. system. We had a chance to take another round of hands-on time with Fatal Fury at Summer Game Fest, and it continues to be a knockout.</p><p dir="ltr">This new demo removed two characters from the previous hands-on--sorry, Hotaru and Tizoc fans. However, replacing them in this demo's roster were two characters who have been confirmed since that first preview session: Marco Rodrigues, who was announced in April, and Vox Reaper, one of two new characters confirmed during Summer Game Fest Live. The other, B. Jenet, was not present in our demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319548-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319548" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319548-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319548"></a><figcaption>Vox Reaper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319548-ss04.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319549-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319550-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319551-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319552-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319553-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319554-ss09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319549,1300-4319550,1300-4319551,1300-4319552,1300-4319553,1300-4319554" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319549-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319550-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319551-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319552-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319553-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319554-ss09.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319549-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319550-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319551-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319552-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319553-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319554-ss09.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even before we took the controller, we continued to be impressed with Fatal Fury's art style; the "American comic" approach to color and shading really makes each character pop off the screen. In an interview with GameSpot after the hands-on session concluded, Fatal Fury art director Nobuyuki Kuroki said that this visual style, rather than taking a more realistic approach, was always the intention.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you look at what other game companies are doing, you can already see games at the pinnacle of realistic graphics and even anime graphics," Kuroki said. "We were trying to find a niche that nobody else has used, and then tried to perfect it and make it our own." When asked which character revealed so far is the best example of what the team has achieved, he quickly responded with "all of them," before eventually choosing Tizoc as the most visually impressive so far.</p><p dir="ltr">During our hands-on, we focused on using Marco and Vox Reaper. We tried out Vox first, who is evocative of the sub-boss Grant from Garou: Mark Of The Wolves. Vox thrives in the neutral game; his powerful one-off strikes pay dividends as a match progresses. His game is more of a patient one, where we'd be biding time and waiting for an opening to strike before moving in.</p><p dir="ltr">His command throw is a major part of his arsenal, as he can immediately follow it up with his uppercut special move or another big move as soon as the animation ends. He also takes a few special moves straight out of Grant's Garou kit, which will give longtime Grant players an edge from the jump. Of the two new characters in this build, Vox is the one we wish we had more time to figure out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319555-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319555" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319555-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319555"></a><figcaption>Marco Rodrigues</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319555-ss04.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319556-ss03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319557-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319558-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319559-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319560-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319561-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319562-ss09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319556,1300-4319557,1300-4319558,1300-4319559,1300-4319560,1300-4319561,1300-4319562" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319556-ss03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319557-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319558-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319559-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319560-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319561-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319562-ss09.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319556-ss03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319557-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319558-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319559-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319560-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319561-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319562-ss09.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a few turns with Vox, we moved on to Marco, and from the word "fight," we immediately clicked. Marco practices Kyokugenryu Karate, which in the deep lore of SNK, is a style also used by the Sakazaki family--most notably Ryo and his father, Takuma. As such, Marco plays very much like those two martial artists, and his take on the style packs a powerful yet familiar punch.</p><p dir="ltr">Marco's kit includes both the Kouken fireball and the Kohou uppercut, as well as the Hien Shippuu Kyaku jumping-kick combo. His powerful Haoh Sho Kouken fireball super move fills the screen with fire, as well, providing one of the martial artist's flashiest moves. Where Vox requires some more time on the sticks after this demo, we feel we could hold our own against anyone right now.</p><p dir="ltr">This new hands-on wasn't the only SNK update of the weekend, however: One of the more groundbreaking announcements of Summer Game Fest was the addition of Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui to Street Fighter 6. The inclusion makes Terry and Mai the first-ever guest characters in the core Street Fighter franchise, despite Capcom and SNK partnering up in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury producer Yasuyuki Oda says that those discussions began back in 2022, when Evo returned to Las Vegas for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. "At Evo in 2022, we had SNK- and Capcom-themed posters that we collaborated on," Oda said, and those kicked off further talks during the same event.</p><p dir="ltr">"There were a couple of dinners during that time, and that's basically when the talks began," Oda said, adding that the two teams "are on very great terms nowadays; I know [Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki] Nakayama is a huge SNK fan, and we're all big Street Fighter fans as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is not only a reinvention of the classic fighting franchise; it's a sign of SNK's renaissance as a whole. With more games and partnerships coming down the pipeline, the company may find itself in a new age of glory before long, and based on how City Of The Wolves has played in two preview sessions, we're looking forward to what's next.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves will launch in early 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-urban-fantasy-books/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-urban-fantasy-books<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Urban Fantasy is an easy way to add a twist to a familiar setting. Essentially, it takes a modern (or near-ish future) setting and mixes it with fantasy elements; usually magic. Generally, but not always, this is used as a backdrop for another genre, such as horror.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">It’s a very malleable sub-genre that combines the familiar with the fantastical. It may take place in a real-world city or a fictional town, but it’s a place we’re all familiar with. However, the presence of magic or other fantasy elements brings their share of whimsy and an escape from the ordinary. Here are some of the best you can check out now.</p> <h2 id="h-city-of-bones-cassandra-clare" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/cRYHpsI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">City of Bones – Cassandra Clare</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/cRYHpsI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">City of Bones</a></em> is the first in the series of <em>The Mortal Instruments</em> novels, and is a good introduction to her world featuring the Institute and Shadowhunters and her family’s connection with them. The series consists of six mainline novels that follow Clary Fray as she discovers herself and grows into her new role as a protector of mundane humans.</p> <h2 id="h-fire-and-hemlock-diana-wynne-jones" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/2gBHC01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Fire and Hemlock – Diana Wynne Jones</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Based on (and around) the Scottish ballads of “Tam Lin” and “Thomas the Rhymer,” <em><a href="https://geni.us/2gBHC01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Fire and Hemlock</a></em> is one of the foundational titles that helped shape Urban Fantasy as it is today. As such, it isn’t as overt when it comes to mixing fantasy with familiar. The fantasy aspect comes from portentous stories and the involvement of the Fae.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">Mostly, it tells the story of Polly Whittacker and follows her relationship with Thomas Lynn over the years. It’s told retrospectively, looking back at alternate memories. It’s a bit difficult to describe, especially because parts of it are somewhat nebulous. Many of its fans suggest that it’s important to read it at least twice to really grok the ending.</p>
 <h2 id="h-moon-called-patricia-briggs" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Npqhei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Moon Called – Patricia Briggs</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/Npqhei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Moon Called</a></em> is the foundation upon which Patricia Briggs built up the Mercy Thompson series. While the “Mercyverse” (as I’m first hearing it called now) is rather vast now, this is where it started. The series, in general, follows Mercy, a shapeshifter who can change into a coyote, as she deals with other supernatural-related problems. In <em>Moon Called</em>, this takes the form of an investigation into missing Werewolves that balloons from there. It’s a solid introduction to the characters and world the series is based around.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-darker-shade-of-magic-v-e-schwab" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/edBAg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Darker Shade of Magic – V.E. Schwab</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">Following a magician who is capable of jumping to four different versions of London (White, Grey, Black, and Red, A Darker Shade of Magic has a nice adventuresome tone to it. An envoy with the side hustle of smuggling, Kell winds up in possession of sinister stone and thrown together with a thrill-seeking thief.</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">V.E. Schwab has continued the series with two more books, and a movie adaptation is reportedly in the works.</p> <h2 id="h-the-city-amp-the-city-china-mieville" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/EPEvVo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The City &amp; The City – China Miéville</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">This is perhaps here mostly because I like a good police procedural, but having won countless awards, <em><a href="https://geni.us/EPEvVo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The City &amp; The City</a></em> is worth a recommendation regardless of your expectations for Urban Fantasy. It follows the exploits of Tyador Borlú as he works to solve a murder that takes him from the Eastern European streets of Besźel to its twin city of Ul Qoma.</p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><em>The City &amp; The City</em> is a bit more surreal and weird than a lot of the relatively grounded fiction found elsewhere on this list. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re searching for something to read.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-atrocity-archives-charles-stross" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/eSb7k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Atrocity Archives – Charles Stross</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/eSb7k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Atrocity Archives</a></em> is technically two short novels that set up <em>The Laundry Files</em>, a series of stories following the eponymous agency “The Laundry.” Many of the books (including the ones in this collection) have Bob Howard as the protagonist, as he helps the Laundry protect the world from supernatural and extra-dimensional threats.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">The series brings a technological side to unknowable threats from beyond the veil of reality, giving them a unique hook to its world-building. The threats in the books range from elder gods to elves, giving the world no shortage of antagonists.</p> <h2 id="h-sandman-slim-richard-kadrey" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/j9frFOl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sandman Slim – Richard Kadrey</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">A hitman from hell is an idea where the concept alone gets the endorphins pumping. It’s almost like <em>Doom</em>, but not the <em>Doom </em>novels. <em><a href="https://geni.us/j9frFOl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sandman Slim</a></em> follows James “Sandman Slim” Stark who, after spending 11 years in hell, arrives in L.A. to exact his revenge against those who wronged him. There’s plenty of action, but it’s also packed with dark humor. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, which helps make the flex of a concept easier to swallow.</p>
 <h2 id="h-borderland-various-edited-by-terri-windling-and-mark-alan-arnold" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Fx8vAw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Borderland – Various (Edited by Terri Windling and Mark Alan Arnold)</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/Fx8vAw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Borderland</a>,</em> in itself, is actually an anthology of stories by a handful of authors. However, they’re all based around a shared Urban Fantasy universe. The series is set in and around a city called Bordertown on the, er, border of the Elflands (appropriately inhabited by fantasy elves) and the World (inhabited by us).</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">The series is generally aimed at teenagers, but there’s enough thematic variety that it can even appeal to those of us who have left the traumas of puberty behind for the vacuous emptiness of adulthood. Wait, I got sidetracked. I just meant to say “young at heart.”</p> <h2 id="h-rivers-of-london-ben-aaronovitch" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/kPBj1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rivers of London – Ben Aaronovitch</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Another Urban Fantasy book that focuses on law enforcement in a world bent by the supernatural, <em><a href="https://geni.us/kPBj1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rivers of London</a></em> has Peter Grant, an up-and-coming British police officer, as he deals with a wave of murders, as well as the gods of the Thames. It’s a fun and personal story written with an enjoyable amount of sass.</p> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Like many books on this list, <em>Rivers of London</em> also spawned a series after it and has also been adapted into graphic novels.</p>
 <h2 id="h-american-gods-neil-gaiman" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/yj2cCT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">American Gods – Neil Gaiman</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">This list could have basically been entirely Neil Gaiman novels, as the author is one of the most prolific and influential Urban Fantasy writers. As such, it’s really difficult to pick one particular example to recommend. Adapted into a TV series back in 2017, <em><a href="https://geni.us/yj2cCT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">American Gods</a></em> seems like a great starting point.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">It follows an ex-convict who, while grieving the loss of his wife, takes a job for an enigmatic figure, which leads him on a trip across America. Along the way, he meets the physical manifestations of the Gods and becomes entwined with their struggles.</p>

His relationship with his surrogate daughter, Ellie, in the post-apocalypse is far more complicated, and has been subject to heavy, even hostile debate since <em>The Last of Us </em>launched in 2013. The sequel and HBO show try to paint him as a more sympathetic figure, making explicit his misguided attempts at violence-driven love were just that, but ultimately, that’s not enough for those who have always viewed his actions in contempt.<br></p><p>But also, look at him.

I asked executive producer Mark Rubin and creative director Safy Saada  about that, how they decide on which Ubisoft games to add, and all the work that goes into taking characters from one franchise and smashing them into <em>XDefiant’s </em>fast-paced FPS world.</p><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,196181,196345" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Ubisoft’s recently released online shooter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-tips-tricks-ubisoft-shooter-call-of-duty-help-1851519361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-tips-tricks-ubisoft-shooter-call-of-duty-help-1851519361"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span>, might at first glance look like <em>Call of Duty</em> or other similar shooters. But one of the big differences between <em>XDefiant </em>and other games is the inclusion of characters, maps, and cosmetics from other Ubisoft-published and developed franchises, like <em>Ghost Recon</em> and <em>Far Cry. </em></p><p>For example, the game’s launch season—dubbed Season 0—adds DedSec hackers from <em>Watch Dogs</em> into the game. I asked why those silly computer nerds were the first to be added to <em>XDefiant</em>. </p><p>“When you look at all of our factions, you’ll see that each of them have a specific core archetype, whether it’s defense, healing, or fire damage,” said Rubin. “We wanted to make sure we had that core group available to the player. With DedSec and their disruption archetype, they really fit into that unlockable layer of factions to add.” </p><h2 id="h165371"><a id=""></a>Why bad guys from <em>The Division</em> are in <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>Currently, the game has five factions: Libertad from <em>Far Cry 6</em>, Phantoms from <em>Ghost Recon,</em> Third Echelon from <em>Splinter Cell</em>, The Cleaners from <em>The Division</em>, and the previously mentioned DedSec from <em>Watch Dogs</em>. It’s a strange line-up of characters, for sure, so I asked what Ubisoft and the <em>XDefiant</em> devs are looking for when deciding on who to add to the game. </p><p>“First, we look at what we want to add gameplay-wise,” said Saada. “Once we identify the archetype we’re looking for, we look to see if that can be filled through the Ubisoft IPs that we have.”</p><p> Saada also says that the team tried to include things that players weren’t expecting because the surprise can add more fun to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span>. This is why The Cleaners, bad guys with flamethrowers from <em>The Division</em>, are in the game. </p><p>“Everyone has played as a Division Agent, but nobody has ever played as a member of the Cleaners until now. Giving players those types of unique opportunities played a role in having the Cleaners [in <em>XDefiant</em>],” said Rubin.<br></p><p>And this idea of trying to surprise players with unexpected factions is also applied to the rest of the game.<br></p><p>“Is there something iconic we can take from other [Ubisoft] games and create new features from it? This all plays a part in the decisions that are made,” said Saada. <br></p><p>Oh and if you, like me, were wondering why <em>XDefiant </em>includes characters from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/ghost-recon-phantoms-is-closing-its-doors/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ghost-recon-phantoms-is-closing-its-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a now-defunct <em>Ghost Recon</em> game</a></span>, it all comes down to finding unique and “specific” abilities that add new archetypes to the FPS. </p><p>“We chose the <em>Ghost Recon</em> Phantoms over any other game/faction because they had specific and iconic abilities that fit the archetype we wanted for them,” said Saada. </p><h2 id="h165372"><a id=""></a>How weird will things get in <em>XDefiant</em>?</h2><p>Of course, I had to ask: Will <em>XDefiant</em> ever add <em>Just Dance </em>characters to the game? Or maybe Rabbids? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219">Some previous leaks</a></span>, which have so far <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://siege.gg/news/xdefiant-season-1-brings-rainbow-six-siege-operators-and-maps-into-the-fold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://siege.gg/news/xdefiant-season-1-brings-rainbow-six-siege-operators-and-maps-into-the-fold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven to be true</a></span>, seem to indicate that these wilder inclusions might be coming in the future. And according to Rubin, nothing is “off the table” when it comes to what could show up next in Ubisoft’s big, new <em>CoD</em>-like FPS.</p><p>“That’s one of the most fun things about our game—that mosh pit of Ubisoft IPs. I would say that there really isn’t anything off the table,” said Rubin. </p><p>“But again, it has to fit into the mechanics that we built. But other than that, we can do anything. For us, the whole point of having all these different factions is to celebrate those IPs. Anything we can do, whether it’s through a faction, a map, skins, or weapons, anything that we pull from other games is really a celebration of those games. And that, to me, is what really stands out about <em>XDefiant</em>.”</p><p>Stay tuned as we’ll have more from our interview with Ubisoft about <em>XDefiant</em>, including the devs’ thoughts on bunny-hopping, balancing a live game, and how the team makes its fan-favorite maps.<br></p><p><em> XDefiant </em>is out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Its next season starts on July 1.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Most of the Ghost Tracker quests you can get from Micah-10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>, are fairly straightforward. One of the later missions, dubbed "The Illusion," can get a little confusing, though. That's because it takes you to a very specific and somewhat tough-to-reach spot in Savathun's Throne World, and the waypoints that lead you to your destination are currently a bit buggy.</p><p dir="ltr">The tricky part of the quest starts after you complete the first step, in which you play through The Cunning, a mission from the campaign of The Witch Queen expansion. Once you've made your way through the mission and scanned the Final Shape statue it includes to gather the necessary Ghost Telemetry, you'll be dispatched to Savathun's Throne World to actually track the Ghost down.</p><p dir="ltr">The place you want to go is where you faced down Savathun in the final battle during the campaign of The Witch Queen, but if you haven't been to the Throne World in a bit, finding that exact spot can be confusing. That's doubly true because the waypoints for this particular mission seems to be glitched and will take you close to where you want to go, but down into the depths of the Throne World rather than up to its pinnacle, and you can get lost down there. Here's where you want to go to find the Ghost.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Make For The Court Of Thorns</h2><p dir="ltr">Start at the Quagmire transmat zone, hop on your sparrow, and head east into the Florescent Canal. You want to continue east from there toward the Court of Thorns area, which requires heading into the big door at the eastern edge of the area.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319530-20240614113150_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319530" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319530-20240614113150_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319530"></a><figcaption>If you wind up here, you have gone too far. The easiest way to correct the mistake is to transmat back to the Quagmire and ride back to the Court of Thorns.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319530-20240614113150_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you go through the door, follow the path until you make your way out onto a huge bridge. Ahead of you is a big door, but <strong>do not go through it</strong>. The waypoint will guide you through the door and downward, and while you can potentially climb to where you need to be using Strand grapples and a little luck, it's a big pain and likely to get you stuck down there.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, you want to go up.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Find The Elevator Beam</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319531-illusionghosttrackercourtofthornsbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319531-illusionghosttrackercourtofthornsbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319531"></a><figcaption>Jump into this admittedly easy to miss green beam, which will carry you up toward your true destination.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319531-illusionghosttrackercourtofthornsbeam.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Look for a green elevator beam on the left side of the bridge, emanating from a round white dish in front of a Thrall statue. You might remember this from the Wellspring activity--the beam will take you up to where you usually go for those encounters. While the waypoint won't mark this for you, it's the proper way to go to reach the upper portions of Savathun's Throne World.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Keep Going Up To The Bell</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319532-illusionghosttrackersecondbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319532" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319532-illusionghosttrackersecondbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319532"></a><figcaption>Spin around and hop into this second elevator beam to reach the top of the Throne World and the Ghost.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319532-illusionghosttrackersecondbeam.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first elevator beam will take you up to where the Wellspring event takes place, but don't advance any farther forward. You're only about halfway to your destination, and once again, the waypoint isn't going to help you. When you land from the elevator beam, spin around 180 degrees and face the way you just came. You'll see another, darker elevator beam going straight up, hanging in the air off the ledge you just landed on. This is the path you want--jump out to the beam and it'll raise you up to the top of the Throne World.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Continue To The Island</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319529-illusionghosttracker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319529-illusionghosttracker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319529"></a><figcaption>Pass through this arena and follow the bridge out to the distant island.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319529-illusionghosttracker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you reach the top of the beam, it's a straight shot to your destination. Climb the stairs beneath the ringing bell to reach a courtyard, the Sanctum of the Brood Queen. You should remember this place from when you battled Savathun in The Witch Queen. The arena terminates at the edge of the water ahead, but you'll find a bridge that leads you out toward a distant island. That's the spot where you ultimately defeated Savathun at the end of the campaign. On the island, you've finally reached the search area. There's a central tower with a glowing light here ringed by new, sliced-up Final Shape statues. Go past those toward the back of this lower area to find the Ghost lying on the ground.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319533-illusionghosttrackerghostlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319533" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319533-illusionghosttrackerghostlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319533"></a><figcaption>The Ghost is, finally, in the middle of the arena toward the back, lying on the floor next to these round pieces of architecture, just past the horse statue.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319533-illusionghosttrackerghostlocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides</a> for anything else you need to know about Destiny 2's new expansion, and don't miss our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.</p>

While its PS4 version is backwards compatible on PS5, fans still want to play an enhanced version with features such as improved framerates and higher resolution. As it turns out, many From Software developers want a PC port, too.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, director Hidetaka Miyazaki was asked once again about the possibility of Bloodborne on PC. Except this time around, he was specifically asked if he personally wanted to see it happen.</p><p>He pointed to producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson and said, "I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port. If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to."</p><p>Miyazaki continued by explaining that he wants more players to enjoy Bloodborne, especially as the years go by and sometimes games get lost to older hardware and time. "I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past," he says. "So as far as I'm concerned, that's definitely not something I'd be opposed to."</p><p>Since From Software doesn't own the rights to Bloodborne, it's not the <a href="https://x.com/jeffgrubb/status/1801409807406284978" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">studio's call to make</a>, but rather Sony's. However, Sony hasn't seemed to forget about Bloodborne as the game is making a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-bit-of-bloodborne-is-coming-to-ps5-but-not-in-the-way-fans-want/1100-6524027/" data-ref-id="1100-6524027">cameo in the upcoming Astro Bot game</a>. That game's creative director is adamant this isn't a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tease of anything</a>, but rather an homage to a PlayStation great from the past.</p><p>In the meantime, folks will still be able to enjoy more Elden Ring content when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/" data-ref-id="1100-6523901">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion launches on June 21.</p>

  <p id="Bf58OB">Right now, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a><em> </em>fans are settling in for a season of backstabbing, violence, and betrayal.</p>
<p id="FF7Vec">And so am I, because I’m watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vZEY2A9f_h1WEcKKbo-RoY7Y4GjkuUy">a YouTuber build a 1,000 gallon vivarium full of hostile ant colonies</a>.</p>
<p id="UreDFn">Over the last six months, Mikey Bustos, who goes by AntsCanada, has been cultivating biodiversity in a 12-foot long vivarium that he keeps in his home in the Philippines. The latest addition is a six-inch long baby caiman, which he plans to eventually move to a separate swamp vivarium and then to his backyard. The ethics and legality of this are unclear to me, but it is compelling viewing nonetheless.</p>
<p id="G8nT1m">Bustos, who has long been what I guess I would call an ant YouTuber, uses a 4K camera to capture the residents of the vivarium, a world that he’s named Pantdora. Yes, with a “t.” There are tree frogs, geckos, many species of ants, crickets, cockroaches, guppies, spiders, the aforementioned caiman, shrimp, and more.</p>

<p id="JNwu6u">A tree frog gets a similarly poetic introduction. “When I spotted her out and about in Pantdora, I was awestruck how beautiful she was in the misty moonlight,” Bustos tells us. “I named her Miss Piggy.”</p>
<p id="14U7hH">The rhythms of the videos makes me feel lightly insane. I am pretty sure they’re made and paced for children. The image quality is stunning, but they have the narrative simplicity and deranged cadence of something like CoComelon, and Bustos’ narration is less David Attenborough, and more Dora the Explorer. </p>
<p id="a7Q6Gf">But the Drama. Oh, the Drama.</p>

<p id="qILpNZ">At the beginning of the series, Bustos realizes that several ant colonies have accidentally ended up in Pantdora, after stowing away in a giant salvaged tree stump and soil from his yard. He’s thrilled to see a lively colony of marauder ants —<em> but wait, what’s this? </em></p>
<p id="TNdkq3">Two invasive ant species have also made their home in the vivarium: fire ants and black crazy ants. </p>
<p id="aqbHrn">A brief, bloody skirmish between the marauders and the fire ants ends with casualties: Bustos watches sadly as a marauder major dies, locked in battle with a fire ant. The surviving marauders bury the bodies, while the fire ants retreat to their tunnels, presumably to breed and shore up their numbers.</p>
<p id="NGiMXF">But the black crazy ants seem to coexist with the marauder ants in the tree stump (formally dubbed the Hallelujah Tree Stump). Until one day.</p>
<p id="mSsMhU">Hundreds of black crazy ants — with multiple queens — come pouring out of the stump, carrying eggs and moving the colony from the middle to the top of the stump. Bustos realizes that inside the stump, a war may have been raging between the crazy ants and the marauders — who haven’t been as plentiful lately. Also, the crazy ants have somehow infiltrated the hardened poop tunnels of a colony of termites who share the Hallelujah Tree Stump! Can the colony survive? Or have the king and queen, and their valuable eggs, been killed?</p>
<p id="dlLurA">As Bustos says, “Mother nature is just stunning, isn’t she?”</p>
<p id="OgFrID">I can’t wait to find out what happens in the ant war. Or what havoc the new praying mantis will wreak. Or what will happen after Bustos’ huntsman spider, Lady Deathstrike, is introduced to the ecosystem — along with her egg sac. </p>

<p id="VfK0mi">The thing is, despite the overdramatic voiceover, I genuinely believe in Bustos’ enthusiasm for his creatures. When he exclaims over a baby grasshopper crawling up a vine, praising its wisdom in moving slowly so that predators (like tree frogs Kermit and Miss Piggy) won’t see it, I get it! It’s pretty cool, and I’ve never been so engrossed in the complicated and dangerous lives of insects before.</p>
<p id="R6AId5">I’m not sure how many other adults will be able to put up with the child-like narration of Bustos’ videos. Come to that, I’m not sure how many other adults will be compelled by watching two huntsman spiders have sex in stunning 4K. But I need to know what happens next in Pantdora, and I will be tuning in.</p>

If you’re underleveled, consider advancing the main story and returning to this encounter later. This is especially helpful if you’re playing the <em>Vengeance </em>story, since you’ll recruit Guest characters who can come in clutch for this fight. Also consider stocking up on <strong>Elec Shards</strong> from Cadaver’s Hollow to give the Nahobino and any other human characters a way to exploit Matador’s weakness.<br></p><p>With that out of the way, here’s everything you need to know about overcoming Matador.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-recommend-id="image://e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-recommend-id="image://e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h158465"><a id=""></a>Matador’s abilities and weaknesses</h2><p>At first glance, Matador doesn’t seem too bad. <strong>He’s weak to Electric (Zio) damage, Immune to Force (Zan) damage, and resists Hama and Mudo</strong>. He also resists a spread of status ailments, though you can still inflict these conditions since he’s not full immunities. While Electric damage is your best option here, Physical attackers are perfectly viable too. This is especially true of any Physical moves that have a higher likelihood to inflict a critical hit (like <strong>Aramasa</strong>).</p><p>The real challenge here is Matador’s skills. New to <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em> is the <strong>Crippling Blow </strong>innate skill, <strong>which gives Matador a chance to instantly kill anyone when it hits a weakness or scores a critical hit</strong>. Yes, just one unlucky dice roll when Matador strikes the Nahobino can turn an otherwise successful encounter into an instant loss. Matador will exclusively inflict <strong>Physical </strong>and <strong>Force</strong> damage, so avoid bringing any demons who are weak to either of those.<br></p><p>You’ll also want to watch out for <strong>Red Capote</strong>, which will raise Matador’s accuracy and evasion by two stages whenever it’s used. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> really punishes you for missing attacks, so you’ll want to use <strong>Sukunda</strong> to counter this buff. In fact, <strong>any and all debuffs will serve you well here</strong>, since Matador doesn’t have any way to neutralize these conditions.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-recommend-id="image://41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-recommend-id="image://41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h158466"><a id=""></a>Matador’s battle strategy</h2><p>Before you even have a chance to attack, Matador will use <strong>Red Capote</strong>. Use <strong>Sukunda </strong>and other debuff moves ASAP so you don’t risk letting Matador dodge your attacks, since this will put you on the backfoot immediately. You can use a <strong>Purge Charm</strong> to immediately remove the effects of Red Capote, which helps a great deal if you don’t have multiple demons using Sukunda.</p><p>Fortunately, Matador casts Red Capote infrequently beyond this point. Though it can use <strong>Marakunda </strong>to lower your party’s defense, you shouldn’t have to worry too much if you keep Matador’s attack debuffed with <strong>Tarunda </strong>or equivalent attacks. Otherwise, Matador will primarily hit you with Physical attacks and the occasional <strong>Mazan</strong>, so make sure to defend accordingly.<br></p><p>As has been the case with other bosses, you’ll eventually see the text “<strong>Matador began gathering nearby Magatsuhi!</strong>” To counter this, <strong>make sure your party uses Guard at the end of their turn</strong>. Guarding is the only way you can completely negate the chance of suffering a critical hit, which Matador will inflict after gathering Magatsuhi. This is a good tip for many boss encounters, but it’s especially vital here.<br></p><p>That said, based on my testing, Matador seemed to use <strong>Mazan </strong>after gathering Magatsuhi, which he then followed with <strong>Andalucia </strong>(which inflicts multiple Physical hits) on the next turn. Because of this, you may want to have the Nahobino use Guard for another turn to avoid the possibility of catching an unlucky critical hit. This also means that anyone in your party immune to Force may be able to endure his Magatsuhi-charged attack without guarding. Your mileage may vary.<br></p><p>Aside from this, Matador doesn’t have any other surprises to throw at you. Keep him comprehensively debuffed, exploit his thunder weakness as much as you can, and pile on the damage until he goes down. Your tactics beyond that will depend on your party composition, so let’s give you some pointers.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-recommend-id="image://1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-recommend-id="image://1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h158467"><a id=""></a>How to build the Nahobino to fight Matador</h2><p>Given Matador’s moveset, <strong>you’ll mitigate a ton of damage by imbuing the Nahobino’s Affinities with the Sudama Essence</strong>. This will grant your protagonist total immunity to Force damage, protecting him from potential critical hits via Mazan <em>and </em>making him cut Matador’s turns short (enemies abide by the same Press Turn system the party does, so hitting an immunity inflicts a turn penalty). Sudama’s weaknesses aren’t relevant in this encounter, and you can purchase the essence from Cadaver’s Hollow.</p><p>Beyond that, Nahobino’s moveset will depend on how you’ve built him and what party members you’ll bring to the fight. <strong>Aramasa </strong>remains one of your strongest moves in a Physical build, whereas <strong>Zio </strong>or <strong>Zionga </strong>will obviously excel in a magic build. Physical Nahobinos may still prefer to bring Zio if you don’t want to bank on critical hits for extra turns. Beyond that, debuff moves are useful to bring, and <strong>Miracle Water </strong>will come in clutch if you don’t have a viable healer. <strong>Inflaming Divinity </strong>can help if you’ve progressed far enough to access it, though this will drain your MP very fast. <strong>Rooted Soul </strong>is always viable for the extra HP and MP, so use that if you have a skill slot to spare.</p><h2 id="h158468"><a id=""></a>The best demons and party members to counter Matador</h2><p>You’re forced to take your protagonist into the encounter, but your other monsters are a different story.

It naturally learns <strong>Zionga </strong>to exploit Matador’s weakness, <strong>Sukunda</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to mitigate the effects of Red Capote, <em>and </em>it resists Force damage. It can even counter Matador’s attacks thanks to its <strong>Guardian Beast</strong> innate skill.</p><p>Since other Zio-focused demons are weak to Force, Shiisaa is uniquely one of the best damage dealers you could use in this encounter. You honestly don’t need to do much to build it, just level it up so it learns its full moveset.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-recommend-id="image://a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-recommend-id="image://a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h158470"><a id=""></a>Kikuri-Hime</h2><p>If you need a dedicated healer, Kikuri-Hime is one of your best options. Her primary boon is her <strong>Force immunity</strong>, completely negating Matador’s Mazan. Additionally, she naturally learns <strong>Recarm </strong>and <strong>Media</strong>, which allows you to heal and revive party members as needed. Her innate skill <strong>Divine Benevolence </strong>will also reduce the MP cost of support skills, which includes debuffs.</p><p>Kikuri-Hime’s only downside is her negative electric proficiency, so she struggles as a damage dealer despite her great Magic stat. That said, her support proficiency makes her especially good at using debuffs like <strong>Tarunda</strong>, which she can learn naturally. Also consider giving her the Essence of <strong>Obariyon</strong> to let her learn <strong>Sekunda </strong>and/or <strong>Sekukaja</strong>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0f74594ab41d2b63b0c916abce5e428f" data-recommend-id="image://0f74594ab41d2b63b0c916abce5e428f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Oni screen.

With good Strength, even better Vitality, and native access to the <strong>Taunt </strong>skill, Oni can soak Matador’s Physical attacks like a champ. What’s more, his Physical resistance will dampen Matador’s hits and ease pressure on your healer(s). <strong>Fang Breaker </strong>is also a great support skill, as it deals damage and lowers the enemy’s offenses by one stage.</p><p>If you want to optimize Oni even further, give him the <strong>Counter </strong>ability. This will give Oni a chance to counter attack any enemy that uses a strength-based attack, which is <em>perfect </em>for a tank. You can learn this skill from the <strong>Nozuchi </strong>or <strong>Rakshasa </strong>Essences.<br></p><p><strong>Ippon-Datara</strong> is a serviceable alternative to Oni, thanks to its native access to Taunt and its tank-supporting <strong>One-Foot Hop </strong>ability.

Her most obvious perk is <strong>Zio</strong>, which upgrades to <strong>Zionga</strong> after a small amount of story progress. Thanks to her high Magic stat, she can make good use of these spells. She can heal and debuff Matador’s attack in a pinch too, though you’ll want to save her MP for those electric spells.</p><p>As a human character, Yoko can use items as needed. Given how helpful items are in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, this alone makes Yoko more versatile than she has any right to be. Absolutely no investment or building is required to use Yoko, so slot her into your party if you’re tired of devoting resources to this fight.<br></p><h2 id="h158473"><a id=""></a>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>Aside from the above, any demons that can inflict Electric damage and aren’t weak to Force can work. For example, <strong>Feng-Huang</strong> resists Force and doesn’t have a negative Electric proficiency, so you can teach it Zio and use it as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-recommend-id="image://816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-recommend-id="image://816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As long as you play carefully, you shouldn’t need many backup demons to get through Matador. Build your team right, react to Matador’s attacks, and you should get your clear in no time. As a reward, you’ll unlock a special fusion for Matador, so you can use his powers against all who stand against you. Good luck in the rest of your journey through Da’at!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
