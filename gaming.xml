            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After launching on January 26, <em>Highguard</em> has struggled to keep players, according to data on SteamDB. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201">Wildlight isn’t giving up on the free-to-play raid shooter</a>, and has announced a big<strong>&nbsp;</strong>change for the game: a 5v5 mode.</p> <p>On Friday, Wildlight’s studio head and game director Chan Grenier <a href="https://x.com/ChadGrenier/status/2017271635712352533">teased on Twitter that a “big update”</a> about <em>Highguard</em> was coming, adding “You’ll want to see this one.” About four hours later, after some delay, that update arrived, and it was indeed a biggie. For a limited time, Highguard will offer players a 5v5 mode, a big shift from the game’s 3v3 mode, which many had criticized for being too small and sweaty.</p> <p>“We heard the feedback,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017334052865658987">posted the official <em>Highguard</em> account</a>. “For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it! The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You asked, we listened</p> <p>All-new 5v5 limited time mode, playable now! ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/wBaFZUOCeZ">pic.twitter.com/wBaFZUOCeZ</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017333024598221040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new mode was added as part of a patch that is live now on consoles and PC. 5v5 will only be around for the weekend, for now, and Wildlight warns that adding more players could lead to some performance issues. Still, I’m excited to give <em>Highguard</em> another shot to see if a few more players in the game’s big empty maps could help add some excitement and take some pressure off players having to perform perfectly during team fights.</p> <p>The conversation around <em>Highguard</em> has been a mess ever since it was announced via the final teaser at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards in December</a>. That trailer failed to excite people online, and a period of radio silence afterward left a big void that was filled by angry commentators, confused gamers, lots of blogs, and random takes from users on sites like Reddit and BlueSky. When it finally arrived earlier this week, it saw a huge influx of curious onlookers, nearly reaching 100k concurrent players according to SteamDB data. But just a few days later, <em>Highguard’s</em> playercount has dwindled as <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews continue to flood the game’s Steam page</a>.</p>

 <p>Will this big change be enough to turn things around, or is <em>Highguard</em> doomed to become another flop in a long line of live-service games that have failed to survive? I’m not sure, but at the very least, it seems Wildlight Entertainment is willing to make big changes to the game to try and keep it around.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-has-reportedly-sold-over-20m-copies-most-of-them-on-steam/</link>
            <guid>1421398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If <strong>PlayStation</strong> needed another sign that its current push to put its first-party made and published games on both PC and <strong>PS5</strong> was a good idea, it certainly has it with the latest report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/helldivers-2-sells-20m-copies">Alinea Analytics</a>, which claims that the popular third-person shooter <strong>Helldivers 2</strong> has sold <strong>over 20 million copies</strong>, most of them coming from PC players on Steam.</p>



<p>When Helldivers 2 launched, despite its connectivity issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/">that hindered the experience</a> and the controversy regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">PC players initially being mandated to connect their PlayStation Network accounts to their Steam accounts to play the game</a>, it was immediately the standout hit multiplayer game of 2024. </p>



<p>It skyrocketed to the top of Steam's charts, and even though it hasn't sustained the same level of popularity it had two years ago, it has successfully carved its own dedicated community out of the swath of multiplayer games people can choose to play. Alinea Analytics even adds that in December 2025, Helldivers 2 had <strong>3.6 million monthly active users</strong> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>After Helldivers 2 arrived on PC and PS5 at launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">it came to Xbox Series X/S consoles in summer 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">even ushered in the first instance of Halo coming to PlayStation</a> through a Halo and Helldivers 2 crossover, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo was actually announced as coming to PlayStation</a>.</p>



<p>So far, Helldivers 2 has sold <strong>1.6 million copies on Xbox</strong>, <strong>5.6 million copies on PS5,</strong> and the remaining <strong>13.1 million on PC</strong>. According to Alinea Analytics, it has generated over <strong>$700 million in revenue</strong> for developer <strong>Arrowhead Studios</strong> and publisher <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Helldivers-2-Sales-Alinea-Analytics.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The game is nothing but a roaring success, and as Arrowhead continues to update it with new content, it's likely that we're due for a spike in Helldivers 2 popularity from a new expansion, similar to what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-update/"><strong>Into the Unjust</strong> update</a> did for it last year. Though the most recent update to get excited about was exclusively for PC players, as <strong>Sony's </strong>internal PC porting house, <strong>Nixxes</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-install-size-on-pc-shrinks-by-85-percent-thanks-to-nixxes/">figured out how to shrink the game's install size by <strong>85%</strong>, freeing up a lot of storage space on players' SSDs</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, as far as previously console-exclusive third-person shooters go, when comparing how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/">Gears of War Reloaded</a></strong> did on PS5 versus Helldivers 2 on Xbox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/">Helldivers 2 is the clear winner, selling more on Xbox than Gears of War has done on PS5</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devir Games has announced an <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot. After pulling the game from sale after some controversial content, a revised version of the card game is coming this summer along with a new expansion.</p><h2>The <em>Ace of Spades</em> Reboot Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61522/inappropriate-cards-removed-upcoming-reboot-ace-spades" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot will be hitting retail stores on May 2026. The game will be identical to its original release from Gen Con 2025, with some material removed.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-of-spades-reboot-call-of-the-zombie-box-art.jpg?itok=zHGVF4VG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="500" height="723">

  </picture><p>That removed material are several cards depicting the enslavement of African-Americans. Said cards depicted artwork of an enslaved African American and a slaver. According to the designers, the intention was to invoke the Quentin Tarentino western film <em>Django Unchained</em> with the cards. Instead, audiences saw the cards as trivializing the institution of slavery in the American Wild West.</p><p>Devir Games did issue an apology for these cards, stopped all sales of the game, had retail copies recalled, designed new cards to replace the controversial ones, and issued them free of charge.</p><p>Now with the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot, this revised version of the game is coming back. As our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ace-of-space-review-shuffle-deal-draw" rel="nofollow">original review</a> mentioned, the game is a fun, Wild West spin on poker where winning, much like a gun duel, depends on the draw. The new version of the game will be sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p><p>But this reboot isn't just a formal relaunch. Devir Games has also announced a new expansion for the game, <em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie</em>. This expansion adds 15 new cards to the game, including zombie enemies and four versions of a boss zombie, called Hellbilly. Considering Rockstar Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/look-back-at-red-dead-redemptions-timeless-tale-of-john-marston" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> and the TTRPG <em>Deadlands</em> have done this mash-up, it fits here.</p><p><em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie </em>is available for pre-order on Devir Games' website. It is set to release on May 31, 2026, and will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

When news broke, fans immediately started flooding the internet with tributes, condolences, and jokes about how the wrong </span><i><span>Home Alone 2 </span></i><span>star died.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-screenshots/</link>
            <guid>1421386</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The features for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> have officially been revealed, and with that comes the first batch of screenshots for the game. </p>



<p>The screenshots give players a look at new and updated character models, arenas, match types, and more. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. The series is officially leaving the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 behind after over a decade.</p>



<p>This year’s game features CM Punk as the game’s main cover athlete and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature wrestler in the game’s Showcase Mode</a>. Other improvements include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four new and returning match types</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-nintendo-switch-2-features/" id="173149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2-specific features</a>, and a number of updates to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-features-major-updates-to-fan-favorite-game-modes/" id="173163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favorite game modes</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Run the show your way in WWE 2K26, featuring 400+ WWE Superstars and Legends,” </strong>the game’s description reads. <strong>“Light up the ring with all-new match types, relive CM Punk’s greatest moments, and explore the secrets of The Island.”</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of the Island, the mode is officially coming to PC for the first time after skipping the platform in WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>As mentioned, WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. Those who preorder the higher-tiered editions of the game, however, get access to the game a week early on March 6.</p>

			<p>March is coming up fast, which means it’s nearly time for another <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dose of wrasslin’ game goodness</a>, with 2K officially unveiling WWE 2K26 today. CM Punk is once again gracing the cover this year (a Punk with less gray in his beard appeared on the cover of WWE 2K13) and will be starring in this year’s 2K Showcase mode. Punk is far from the only wrestler in the game, as developer Visual Concepts has apparently packed a whopping 400+ Superstars into WWE 2K26 at launch – a number that will only expand with DLC, etc. You can check out a handful of early screenshots of WWE 2K26, below.</p>

<p>Visual Concepts is also promising four new match types -- I Quit, Inferno, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster – as well as some new plunder to use against opponents, such as shopping carts and thumb tacks. Ultimately though, perhaps most exciting for folks like myself who have been playing WWE 2K forever, Visual Concepts have promised a full revamp of the reversal and stamina system, which has long been a glaring weak point for the series. We still don’t know much about <em>how</em> these systems are changing, but apparently the updates will “add a new layer of strategy,” which is exactly the kind of thing I was begging for in last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/">WWE 2K25 review</a>. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K26…</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Creation Suite</strong> - 2X the CAS and Image Slots, Plus Body Morphing: The best-in-class customization mode now offers 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots, doubling the existing count in response to community demand. Community Creations now features a doubled image capacity of 2,000, deeper body and face morphing tools, and two-tone hair color blending, giving players unprecedented freedom to craft the Superstars, arenas, and other creations of their dreams.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyGM</strong> - More Shows, More Superstars Per Match: New Intergender Matches, 5, 6, and 8-manmatches, plus support for more match types than ever before, vastly increase the number of&nbsp; possible matches and outcomes. More shows per season pose new management challenges in2K’s strategic brand management simulation mode.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyRise</strong> - New Theme, Increased Replay Value: Players define their MySuperstar’s journey through two new division-based storylines where villainous or heroic decisions impact MyPlayers like never before. Players can now keep playing even after the main stories are complete, with more unlockable content and achievements to earn for increased replayability.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>The Island</strong> - New Storyline and Environment, Available on All Platforms: 2K’s WWE-themed world is now bigger and more social than ever, and available for the first time on PC. Players will choose one of three factions and battle for control with a revamped progression system. The new Scrapyard Brawl environment, fresh Towers, new shops and branded gear, an expanded MySuperstar builder with face-photo importing, plus upgraded quests, complete with Superstar voiceovers, cutscenes and dialogue screens, enhance the immersive experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, WWE 2K26 is coming in the usual dizzying array of special editions, and, in fact, 2K is pushing the bar further than ever this year, with the $150 Monday Night War Edition. Here are the different ways you can buy WWE 2K26:</p>

            <guid>1421326</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is updating some of the most popular game modes in major ways.</p>



<p>It’s WWE Royal Rumble weekend, and that means that there is a major push regarding marketing for the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game. <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released">New information from The Takedown on SI </a>confirms several updates coming to the game modes. </p>



<p>In addition to confirming several updates previously reported by Insider Gaming, new details give plenty for longtime fans of WWE video games to be excited about, as it pertains to customization, replay value, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-universe-mode-gets-a-draft-and-more">WWE Universe Mode Gets a Draft and More</h2>



<p>Universe Mode has been a focal point of WWE video games since 2010. Sandbox mode in WWE games lets players be the promoter they’ve always wanted to be, setting up cards, creating rivalries, managing injuries, and more.</p>



<p>This year, WWE 2K26 not only adds a Draft to Universe Mode to increase realism, but also introduces a new Universe Creation Wizard, additional promo types to add more drama to your rivalries, a “Watch Show” mode for those that like pure sim experiences, and more.</p>



<p>MyGM Mode, which acts as a more short-term brand management sim, is also getting some improvements. There will be support for more match types than ever, including intergender and eight-man matches, more shows per season, and new management challenges.</p>



<p>MyRISE, the game’s version of MyPLAYER from NBA 2K, also features major improvements, including the ability to continue their career mode beyond completing the campaign. This year’s campaign will also feature new decision-based storylines in which your choice to keep your customized WWE Superstar as a babyface or a heel will affect the story.</p>



<p>The Island mode will also come to PC for the first time ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-creation-suite-options-spark-new-life-in-wwe-2k26">New Creation Suite Options Spark New Life in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>In addition to all of those updates, there are major improvements to the Creation Suite. For the first time, there will be 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots. This is double the existing amount and provides plenty of options not only to create your own stars but also to download popular stars from other promotions. Additionally, Community Creations now supports 2,000 images, advanced body/face morphing, and two-tone hair blending for maximized Superstar and arena customization.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release to the general public on March 13, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/">if you pre-order a premium edition</a>, you can get Early Access.

      <p>Greg Bovino, who was voted “most likely to run a lawless band of white nationalist secret police” in high school based on looks alone, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/27/gregory-bovino-minneapolis-minnesota-alex-pretti-shooting?ref=aftermath.site"><u>might be out</u></a>, but Minnesota is still under siege. 3,000 ICE agents continue to run rampant, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brainnotonyet.bsky.social/post/3mdlzwx6lek2g?ref=aftermath.site"><u>neither side</u></a> of our government seems particularly interested in reining them in. It’s one thing to watch the carnage play out on a phone screen; it’s another entirely to be there. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ben Hanson of worker-owned media outlet <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax?ref=aftermath.site"><u>MinnMax</u></a> to talk about what it’s been like covering games – and just generally existing – amid ICE’s violent occupation of Minnesota. Ben tells us about the strange juxtaposition of tragedy (abandoned cars, large portions of the population terrified to leave their homes) and triumph (ordinary people working together to protect their neighbors on a previously unprecedented scale, the generally good vibes of any given protest) that characterizes Minnesotans’ daily existence.&nbsp;</p><p>He also explains his decision to publish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dyNcRGRXY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>a video demonstrating what ICE is doing</u></a> to people in Minnesota on the YouTube channel of MinnMax, which, again, typically focuses on video games. Keep politics out of games? Kinda hard to do when politics are literally banging down your door. (MinnMax is also collaborating with Giant Bomb to host <a href="https://www.givemn.org/story/qexfdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an ICE OUT charity stream</u></a> today, which you should absolutely tune into.)</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that as many people as possible can hear us tell ICE to fuck off. Speaking of, in the unlikely event that an ICE agent is reading this: Fuck off.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Ben: </strong>Some of [our show ideas] are going out in Minneapolis and filming stuff on location, so to speak. And it’s like, well, we just can’t do that. It doesn’t feel safe to be recording and having fun in the streets of Minneapolis these days.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s smaller things. The plan was, Jacob Geller and I were going to do a reaction stream to the <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> Direct that was happening on Sunday. Obviously the most important thing in the world. And then with the second murder happening on Saturday, it was an unbelievably devastating day – a tough day to try to wrap your mind around what’s happening here. Still, throughout that day I was like “I can do the <em>Mario </em>stream, I can do the <em>Mario </em>stream. I can spend ten minutes with Jacob Geller looking at <em>Mario</em>. That seems fine. That seems fine.” It was midnight the night before that I had to reach out to Jacob and be like “I can’t do it. It just feels disingenuous for me to be like ‘Look how cute Yoshi is!’” with “federal murder, federal murder” blinking in my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Then I ended up watching the <em>Mario </em>movie trailer later in the day, and there’s a freaking scene in it with Luigi being scared, and some <em>Mario </em>enemy comes out of a cave, and Luigi panics and fires a thousand fireballs in it. Even just that connotation of somebody panicking and unloading everything they have with their weapon – not to be a complete wimp about it, but that would have hurt to stream Sunday morning and see that live with everything so prominent in my mind. So it impacts content like that in a strange way, I suppose. It’s odd when it sort of sneaks up on you like that.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Are you introducing your listeners and viewers to what’s happening and to politics, or are most of them pretty clued in?</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Most of them are pretty clued in. That was definitely the goal of that standalone video: If you’re not paying attention, maybe this will get you to look at it. Maybe MinnMax has enough clout for you to give it a chance if you’re like “Well, I’m sick of the news. I just want to get away from politics. But I don’t know; if that Ben guy put this together, maybe I’ll watch it. I like his travelogues to GDC.” I don’t know what the comparison is.</p><p>I haven’t seen too many comments of “Wow, I had no idea.” But I have seen a lot of comments of “I’m gonna share this with family members and friends.” That’s impactful. It’s not that common that we’ve seen people be like “F this, stop talking about politics.” We see it every once in a while, but because I think we choose our lanes and try to have an impact, it’s coming from a place that feels like it’s necessary. The part I always like to emphasize too is just that idea of, you can say, “Stop talking about politics,” but at a certain point, this is beyond the realm of politics. When our neighbors are being dragged out of their houses, is it politics to speak up and say, “Uh, guys? We should talk about this! This is happening!”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/i-do-not-feel-safe-in-the-country-international-developers-are-skipping-gdc-because-of-trumps-border-chaos/"><div><p>“I Do Not Feel Safe In The Country”: International Developers Are Skipping GDC Because Of Trump’s Border Chaos [Update]</p><p>‘The reality is the US has become increasingly hostile to foreign nationals regardless of origin’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64541">Famitsu</a> has shared the latest look at physical sales in the region, and it's Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> that has come out on top with 23,428 units sold in its debut week. That's not a particularly high number, it's true, but considering that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came in second with almost 14 thousand, it's not bad going.</p>
<p>A couple of other new releases also broke into the top 10 this time, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> and Broccoli's <strong>UN:LOGICAL</strong> making the cut at fifth and sixth, respectively.</p>

<p>Expectedly, the Switch 2 has remained on top of the hardware side of things, with an additional ~72,000 units under its belt. The standard Switch model sold marginally more than the OLED this week, interestingly, but neither was enough to overtake the PS5 Digital Edition or the Switch Lite.</p>
<p>Combining the three SKUs for Switch this time gives us a total of 17,515, while the trio of PS5 models combine for 9,766.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> is certainly ramping up, as we've just had another <strong>three casting announcements</strong> after two new cast members were announced just yesterday. A report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a> confirms previous rumours that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> <strong>will</strong> <strong>reprise his role as Mimir</strong>, while <strong>Danny Woodburn</strong> (Seinfeld, 90210) and <strong>Jeff Gulka</strong> (The X Files, Once Upon a Time) will play the dwarf brothers <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong>, respectively.</p>



<p>Duncan, Woodburn, and Gulka are the sixth, seventh, and eighth additions to the cast that we've heard about, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> was cast as <strong>Kratos</strong></a>, followed by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong></a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">getting tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker</strong> getting cast as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> accepting the role of <strong>Thor</strong></a>, and last night's latest addition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong> stepping in to play <strong>Odin</strong>,</a> replacing The West Wing's <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who voiced him in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>All of these casting announcements have happened within the month of <strong>January 2026</strong>, with Ryan Hurst being named as Kratos kicking things off just two weeks ago. We may not get the rest of the cast revealed today, but it certainly feels like we have more announcements coming, and that Amazon is trying to get all of these reveals out before the show starts filming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">which is reportedly due sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With Brok, Sindri, and Mimir now settled, other remaining casting choices include <strong>Freya, Baldur</strong>, and, of course, <strong>Atreus</strong>. There are more characters we could see cast for the series, though we can't exactly speculate that we're waiting on casting choices for characters like <strong>Tyr</strong>, <strong>Magni,</strong> <strong>Modi</strong>, <strong>Freyr</strong>, <strong>Thrúd</strong>, and <strong>Angrboda</strong> until we know a bit more about the show's plot direction.</p>



<p>Right now, we know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be pulling from the Norse mythology-based games from 2018 and 2022, but that's about it. The character descriptions included in Variety's report don't include any new information that those who've played the games don't already know, so for now we're left waiting until Amazon, <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>, and Moore can start talking about the show they're planning.</p>



<p>Even though it is focusing on the Norse-based games, it would be exciting to see callbacks to Kratos' days running around Olympus. It seems unavoidable for the show not to address Kratos' past, which opens up an even bigger can of worms regarding which characters are left to be cast. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-early-access-date-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1421290</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Road to Vostok, a highly anticipated first-person survival shooter from a lone developer, is hitting early access in April. This news follows years of development that have yielded multiple demos, scores of evolutions, and the emergence of one of the most exciting games in the hardcore shooter space.</p>



<p>Fans of games like Escape from Tarkov will be enthused by Road to Vostok. While it’s not an extraction shooter, it boasts a very similar aesthetic and core concepts, and it’s set in a ‘post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia.’</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-road-to-vostok-coming-out">When is Road to Vostok Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Road to Vostok, being developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a one-man Finnish team</a>, is the culmination of years of work. Before putting his head down and creating this all-new survival game, Antti Leinonen served in the armed forces and taught visual game design. His efforts have come to life in Road to Vostok, a single-player survival title with hardcore mechanics.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1963610/Road_to_Vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurb on Steam</a>, where you can wishlist the game in anticipation of its early access release, tells you all you need to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Road to Vostok is a hardcore single-player survival game set in a post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia. Survive, loot, plan and prepare to cross the border into Vostok, a permadeath zone where one mistake can end it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Antti uploaded a new trailer for Road to Vostok earlier today, confirming that the game will hit early access on <strong>April 7, 2026</strong>. It will be priced at €14.99, including a 25% discount that starts at launch and runs for two weeks, at which point it will become €19.99.</p>



<p>We’ve been covering Road to Vostok for years, and our impressions of the demos this solo developer has produced have always been stellar. It’s sure to be a hit with fans of games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a>, which you can more or less gauge by the game’s new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Road to Vostok has first-person shooter mechanics aplenty, but it also has a hideout system, multiple maps, in-game traders, dynamic events that unfold as the game’s lifecycle evolves, and a looter-shooter gameplay loop, all of which are applicable to Tarkov fans everywhere.</p>



<p>There’s weapon and character customization, weather systems, a day-night cycle, and survival mechanics that involve elements like eating and drinking, as well as inventory and health management.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to explore Road to Vostok when it launches, you won’t have long to wait, as it comes out on April 7th in early access. For now, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-public-demo-2-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo on Steam</a> that you can explore right now. Until now, more than <strong>one million people </strong>have downloaded the demo, and 600,000 have followed up with a Steam wishlist.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f3fc8a98f2e28"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Peach Winking" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3fc8a98f2e28/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-peach-winking.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is approaching its eight-month anniversary, and developers across the world are interested in getting their games on the newest gaming system out there. At least, that's what <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">GDC's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a> reveals (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twice-as-many-developers-surveyed-by-gdc-say-they-want-to-make-games-on-ps5-or-switch-2-than-on-xbox/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>The report shows that 39% of developers surveyed are at least interested in the Switch 2. That puts it fourth, but barely, as the PS5 and Steam Deck are both at 40%, while PC is way ahead at 80%.</p>
<p>Looking at a few other platforms, the Switch 2 is almost twice as popular as the Xbox Series X | S, which only 20% of the sample of developers are apparently interested in. The original Switch console still has some eyes on it, too, with 13% of developers still keen to develop for the system</p>
<p>In terms of platforms that developers have used to release their most recent games, the Switch consoles are a little lower down — 21% of devs have released a Switch game, with 18% getting their game on the newer Switch 2, from those surveyed. Both are behind the Xbox One, which sits at 23%.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch is a much-less powerful system than other consoles, and the Switch 2 has only been out since June 2025, so those numbers will likely go up this time next year, and as more developers get their hands on dev kits.</p>

<p>But the numbers for the Switch consoles here are a little closer, because more people have a Switch 1 than Switch 2. And that's backed up by a further poll, where developers and companies surveyed were asked what they consider most when choosing a platform to release their game on.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the top result was audience reach, with 78% of developers picking that option. Business model success and discoverability also ranked highly, with 44% and 43% of votes respectively. So it's all down to easy-of-access and past successes, then.</p>
<p>So, it's a pretty good start for the new console, in our eyes. And with a third-party-stacked 2026 ahead of us, we think things can only go up from here. Or, we hope, at least.</p>

			<p><strong>Split Fiction</strong> is one of the many video game-to-film or TV adaptations that <strong>Amazon</strong> has under its belt, and it appears that the adaptation starring <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/"><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong> and directed by <strong>Jon M. Chu</strong></a> has hit a major milestone in the course of its production, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/"><strong>Hazelight </strong>boss <strong>Josef Fares</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezone</a> in a red carpet interview at the <strong>Guldbagge Awards</strong> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>), Fares confirmed that he had seen the first finalized version of the script, and confirmed that he's met Sydney Sweeney in a meeting, but he's not holding his breath about anything just yet. </p>



<p>"<em>I got the first version of the script today," </em>Fares told Moviezone<em>, "but you know, there’s so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this ‘I believe it when I see it.'</em>" Regarding Sweeney, Fares didn't have much to add beyond, "<em>I’ve had a meeting with her and she seems super chill</em>."</p>



<p>We first learned that a Split Fiction movie was in the works back in April 2025, but it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">June 2025 that Amazon MGM won the bidding war</a> to get the film's production rights that it had found a home. Now, it has a script, and while there are plenty of steps to go before we can really start to look forward to the movie, it's better to hear some updates instead of nothing, which is currently the case with <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/">the <strong>It Takes Two </strong>film that was announced back in 2022,</a> and we haven't heard anything about it since.</p>



<p>Split Fiction isn't the only video game adaptation Sweeney is working on, as she's also signed on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">produce an adaptation of <strong>Out Run</strong> alongside <strong>Michael Bay</strong></a>. As for Amazon, it is currently days away from the premiere of the season two finale for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Fallout </strong>TV show adaptation</a>, and lately we've been hearing a lot about the cast for the coming <strong>God of War </strong>TV series, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> all confirmed to be a part of the cast.</p>
