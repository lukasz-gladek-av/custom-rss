Unlike other modes that feature multiple stages with waves of enemies, you only have to worry about two bosses. What spices things up are the additional traits they gain over the four increasing difficulties as well as some general modifiers.</p><p>If you’ve played the Pure Fiction game mode before, you already have a great idea of how the modifiers work. Similar to that mode’s Whimsicality and Cacophony effects, Apocalyptic Shadow has Ruinous Embers and Finality’s Axiom. The former refers to a unique stage effect that’s present in every fight while the latter are buffs that you can choose.<br></p><p>Two teams are necessary to take on the bosses. Your goal is to beat them as fast as possible, as there is an action value that keeps depleting. The fight will end prematurely if it reaches zero. Your score at the end is determined by how much of the action value and the boss’s HP (if any) remains. Aim for high scores to unlock additional rewards. While the mode is permanent, it will be updated every few weeks with a new phase and new enemies to challenge.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0c0408c37e485a5c723a110af730453e" data-recommend-id="image://0c0408c37e485a5c723a110af730453e" data-format="png" data-width="621" data-height="335" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot with details of the Stormwind Knight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot with details of the Stormwind Knight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c0408c37e485a5c723a110af730453e" data-recommend-id="image://0c0408c37e485a5c723a110af730453e" data-format="png" data-width="621" data-height="335" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot with details of the Stormwind Knight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h29927"><a id=""></a>Apocalyptic Shadow Stormwind Knight tips</h2><p>This first-ever phase of the mode is titled Stormwind Knight and pits you against Cocolia and Argenti. They both start with the Steadfast Safeguard trait, which buffs them with 50% less DMG taken. Breaking through their Toughness and triggering a Weakness Break will delay their action and increase their DMG taken by 100%.</p><p>What can help you even more is the Ruinous Embers effect for this phase. Whenever an enemy with the Steadfast Safeguard trait is Weakness Broken, your team will recover all of their skill points and have their Ultimates fully charged. The enemy will furthermore take 15% more Weakness Break DMG as well as 25% more Super Break DMG.<br></p><p>I’ll be breaking down specific strategies for each boss below, but I first want to go over some general tips:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If you can trigger a Weakness Break on a boss’ by utilizing your Ultimates and Skills, go for it! The Ruinous Embers effect will fully recover skill points and recharge every character’s Ultimate, so it’ll be a waste to not go all out beforehand. (This is extra important for any healing Ultimates. You’ll be throwing away free health recovery otherwise.)</li><li>Teams that center around Break Effects and increasing Break Efficiency will excel against both bosses.</li><li>Speed is the name of the game, so feel free to add someone who can increase the SPD stats of your team or advance their actions. Asta and Robin are great picks.</li><li>Characters with AoE attacks will be a big help since both of these bosses can fill their side with summons. Use AoE attacks to keep everyone in check.</li><li>Consider bringing along any characters who can apply weakness types. Cocolia can transfer her Weaknesses and Argenti can summon statues with different Weaknesses. Silver Wolf, Boothill, or the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-2-3-update-firefly-jade-1851550895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-2-3-update-firefly-jade-1851550895">recently released Firefly</a></span> can bypass these inconveniences.</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="57c8d6eb0ba0ad167635ca679671aa14" data-recommend-id="image://57c8d6eb0ba0ad167635ca679671aa14" data-format="png" data-width="622" data-height="337" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Apocalyptic Shadow Cocolia battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Apocalyptic Shadow Cocolia battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="57c8d6eb0ba0ad167635ca679671aa14" data-recommend-id="image://57c8d6eb0ba0ad167635ca679671aa14" data-format="png" data-width="622" data-height="337" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Apocalyptic Shadow Cocolia battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h29928"><a id=""></a>How to beat Apocalyptic Shadow Cocolia</h2><p>Cocolia might be the more annoying of the two bosses in this mode. Her Frozen and Imprisonment crowd control debuffs can still be a real pain, especially when compounded with everything else she gains in Apocalyptic Shadow. Her unique boss traits are as follows:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Battlefield Transfer (Difficulty 1-4) - Gepard joins as an elite enemy that can provide a shield for her. Additionally, Cocolia will transfer her Weaknesses to the Ice Edges she summons. Defeating them will return the Weaknesses and reduce her Toughness as well.</li><li>Nowhere to Escape (Difficulty 3-4) - Cocolia’s summon will mark one of your allies. When Cocolia attacks with a single-target ability, she’ll follow up on the ally that was marked.</li><li>Tenacious Resolve (Difficulty 4) - Reduces DMG received by all enemies, but every Weakness-Type they have increases DMG received.</li></ul><p>Your biggest hurdle here will be the Battlefield Transfer trait. I highly recommend initially focusing on Gepard to get him out of the battle. While he won’t be too annoying when it comes to damage, you don’t want him to apply his shield.<br></p><p>The other half of that annoying trait will be needing to destroy her summons to reapply weakness. This process can stall the fight if you can’t take care of them quickly. It’s even worse in her second phase when she summons four of them with one weakness each. Prioritize the ones you know you can commit the most damage with first.</p><p>The second phase of this fight can be pretty tough as Cocolia will keep charging up her Last Choir of Genesis attack. If you can bring a healer that can also debuff your allies, they’ll be very helpful here. There’s nothing worse than having your DPS locked down by Cocolia’s Imprisonment debuff. Keep everyone free to move and always deal damage to take care of her.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f784b188a0b4e7469d9a8b0fab603acb" data-recommend-id="image://f784b188a0b4e7469d9a8b0fab603acb" data-format="png" data-width="625" data-height="332" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A scene from the Apocalyptic Shadow Argenti fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A scene from the Apocalyptic Shadow Argenti fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f784b188a0b4e7469d9a8b0fab603acb" data-recommend-id="image://f784b188a0b4e7469d9a8b0fab603acb" data-format="png" data-width="625" data-height="332" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A scene from the Apocalyptic Shadow Argenti fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h29929"><a id=""></a>How to beat Apocalyptic Shadow Argenti</h2><p>Argenti requires a mostly similar strategy as he does in other fights. You’ll want to get rid of his summons to prevent him from gaining buffs. His unique boss traits are listed below.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reversal of Fortune (Difficulty 1-4) - Gains access to three Combat Stances that each summon four of the same statues.</li><li>Chivalric Wrath - Summons Speartip statues and takes less DMG. Has Toughness Protection when there are four statues on the field.</li><li>Golden Harvest - Summons Shield statues and increases DMG</li><li>Medal of Elegance - Summons The Honored statues, which must be defeated to select him as a target again.</li><li>Turn Back the Tide (Difficulty 3-4) - Instead of enhancing one statue to be Soulfreed, all statues will be during Phase 2.</li><li>Stellar Protector (Difficulty 4) - All enemies are buffed to receive less DMG and deal more DMG for every summoned unit on their side of the field.</li></ul><p>Just like Cocolia, it’ll benefit you to focus on taking out the summons. He’ll replace the statues with new ones once they’re all gone, but you don’t want them around to buff him. If you’re playing on difficulty 4, it might be worth leaving just one or two alive so you can focus on damaging him directly. There can be a small window before he summons another set and fighting four statues at the highest difficulty is not ideal.<br></p><p>Keep an eye on the countdowns and meters below his HP bar. Reaching the end of the countdown will result in him summoning shields that taunt each of your allies and only have one weakness. AoE skills, Ultimates, and/or characters like Firefly will be your best bet to deal with this.<br></p><p>Likewise, you don’t want to deal with the meter that appears in his second phase. If the four shields he summons manage to buff him all the way, he’ll deal some serious damage. Destroy one and then focus everything you have on him. Once he is Weakness Broken, let him have everything you got.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8858b2ecd42af463619590f78ae0bb1a" data-recommend-id="image://8858b2ecd42af463619590f78ae0bb1a" data-format="png" data-width="623" data-height="336" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screenshot showing Apocalyptic Shadow Stormwind Knights details." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A screenshot showing Apocalyptic Shadow Stormwind Knights details." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8858b2ecd42af463619590f78ae0bb1a" data-recommend-id="image://8858b2ecd42af463619590f78ae0bb1a" data-format="png" data-width="623" data-height="336" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screenshot showing Apocalyptic Shadow Stormwind Knights details." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h29930"><a id=""></a>Best teams for Apocalyptic Shadow Stormwind Knight</h2><p>Between the Ruinous Embers effect and the available buffs, there are some standout characters to pick and form teams with. I’ve listed some potential teams worth trying out to take on these tough challenges below along with the best buffs:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>High Damage for Cocolia - Acheron, Silver Wolf, Boothill, Huohuo, Sundered Paradise Axiom</li><li>DoT Team for Cocolia - Kafka, Black Swan, Sampo, Huohuo, Persistence of Decay Axiom</li><li>F2P Team for Cocolia - Xueyi, Qingque, Serval, Lynx, Sundered Paradise Axiom</li><li>DoT Team for Argenti - Kafka, Luka, Guinaifen, Luocha, Ashen Battleground Axiom</li><li>F2P Team for Argenti - Trailblazer (Preservation), Yukong, Asta, Natasha, Ashen Battleground Axiom</li><li>Weakness Break for Either: Firefly, Trailblazer (Harmony), Ruan Mei, Gallagher/Natasha, Sundered Paradise Axiom</li></ul><p>Of course, these aren’t the only characters who have a chance. Some other characters can fit similar roles as many of the above. There are also a lot of different buffs to make other potential teams viable. </p><p>Try using your favorite/strongest characters and experiment with different builds if need be. This likely isn’t the last endgame mode planned for <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, so there’s no problem with having fun when you can.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Opening Cinematic | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The weapon in question is none other than Frostmourne, the legendary runeblade wielded by Arthas, the villainous Lich King in Blizzard's classic RTS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-2650">Warcraft 3</a> and in the MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>. Two models for Frostmourne can be found in the Diablo 4 Season 5 PTR, with one model sporting a silver blade and crossguard ornament, while the other features the blade and ornament in black.</p><p dir="ltr">What, exactly, these weapon models are for is still unclear. Wowhead additionally datamined all the new Unique items coming as part of Season 5 and Frostmourne is not among them. Blizzard previously offered Frostmourne as a mount ornament, as well as the Lich King's helmet, the Helm of Domination, and his horse, Invincible. The items were offered together as a <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/wows-invincible-lich-king-mount-arrives-to-diablo-4-including-helm-of-domination-and-frostmourne/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 cosmetic bundle</a>. This appearance of Frostmourne is different, however, as it is a weapon model and not a mount ornament, meaning it could be used as a weapon or weapon appearance for Diablo 4's sword-wielding classes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Frostmourne appearing as a wieldable weapon in Diablo 4 would hardly be the first time Blizzard's two fantasy universes have crossed over. Blizzard has offered Diablo-themed mounts in WoW in the past, and to celebrate the launch of Diablo 4 last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-diablo-4-event-has-players-hunting-down-treasure-goblins/1100-6514568/" data-ref-id="1100-6514568">WoW held a Treasure Goblin event</a> where players could earn a number of various Diablo-themed cosmetics. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, players were even able to wield <a href="https://www.diablohub.com/database/item/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker/information/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker</a>, another Legendary WoW weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether Frostmourne will become usable in Diablo 4 with Season 5 or is planned for the future is still unknown, but it does seem worth noting that WoW is celebrating its 20th anniversary later this year, with Blizzard no doubt planning some special events in its games to celebrate the occasion. Given Frostmourne's soul-devouring nature, the weapon would certainly be right at home in the dark Diablo universe were it to be included as part of some WoW crossover event, but fans will have to wait for more information before learning what the weapon's true purpose will ultimately be.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-uniques-are-getting-a-major-buff-in-season-5-ptr-patch-notes/1100-6524451/" data-ref-id="1100-6524451">Diablo 4 Season 5 will be bringing some big changes to Unique items</a>, which have felt neglected and less powerful following the buffs made to Legendary items in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">well-received Season 4 Loot Reborn update</a>. Season 5 will be shorter than previous seasons, but will begin on August 6 and last until the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, in October</a>.</p>

Additionally, different discounts will be provided, and its currently 80% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>When December 15 comes around, Forza Horizon 4 will also be removed from Xbox Game Pass, along with its complete delisting from digital storefronts such as the Microsoft Store and Steam. However, those who already own the game can continue to play it as normal. The online servers are not going to be shut down, and all multiplayer and offline features will still be playable.</p><p>Players with active and fully paid Game Pass subscriptions on June 25 are eligible to receive a game token if they've purchased any extra content for Forza Horizon 4. Forza Horizon games have been delisted in the past, typically as a result of music licenses expiring.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24185747/xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="bwAIzv">There’s a lot to love about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox/2019/6/9/18658748/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-e3-2019-release-date-specs-microsoft">Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller</a>: interchangeable thumbsticks with adjustable tension, multiple paddles (also interchangeable), a comfortable rubber grip. There’s also one thing that’s been slightly less loved: a $179.99 price tag that has persisted since its 2019 debut. </p>
<p id="b0Jh2h">As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1805631532843024522">pointed out by Wario64</a>, Lenovo’s online store has an <a href="https://howl.me/cmxqsjlFMS4">Xbox Elite Series 2 controller deal</a> that substantially assuages that concern. Using the code <strong>XBOXELITE</strong> at checkout will drop the price down to a much more reasonable $95. That’s a savings of $84.99, or about 47 percent off the MSRP—whichever way you want to math it out, it’s a compelling deal if you were looking for a first-party upgrade. </p>

<p id="n2oHFh">The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller works both wired (via USB-C cable) and wirelessly (via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth) for both console and PC. It won’t make you better at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC</a>... but it <em>might </em>make playing feel a little better as you improve.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24185675/lara-croft-dead-by-daylight-survivor-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lara-croft-is-the-next-survivor-to-join-dead-by-daylight%E2%80%99s-huge-roster.911016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185675/lara-croft-dead-by-daylight-survivor-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="i9vXos"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/dead-by-daylight/39050"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a> is packed full of original characters, but it’s also known to cross over with other properties. This started exclusively with horror icons like Nightmare on Elm Street series’ Freddy Krueger and Pyramid Head from <em>Silent Hill</em>, but it’s expanded into less expected properties like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, the real life actor <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23784793/dead-by-daylight-nicolas-cage-dlc-release-date">Nicolas Cage</a>, and now <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/lara-croft-in-dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider/">Tomb Raider superstar Lara Croft</a>.</p>
<p id="prSLTM">In the lore of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, both Killers and Survivors are pulled into a dark realm ruled over by the extraplanar god known as the Entity. It seems like Lara’s various adventures and expeditions was enough to capture the Entity’s attention and see her claimed by the supernatural Fog. Lara Croft will arrive alone, with no map or associated Killer, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/1/30/24054923/alan-wake-dead-by-daylight-crossover-synergy">similar to her colleague Alan Wake</a>.</p>
<p id="sUcWPe">Like other Survivors, Lara comes with three perks that affect her gameplay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="dwWlB5"><strong>Finesse</strong></p>
<p id="TEhYI7">This perk activates while you are healthy. Your fast vaults are 20% faster. This perk goes on cooldown for 40/35/30 seconds after performing a fast vault.</p>
<p id="RCrLuf"><strong>Hardened</strong></p>
<p id="Ul7o59">After you unlock a chest and cleanse or bless a totem, this perk activates. Anytime you would scream, reveal the Killer’s aura for<strong> 3/4/5 seconds</strong> instead.</p>
<p id="mJvSDE"><strong>Specialist</strong></p>
<p id="QqRqMM">Each time you open or rummage through a chest, gain 1 token, up to 3/3/3. When you do a great skill check on a generator, consume all tokens. Then for each token consumed, reduce the maximum required generator progress by 2/3/4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="XG4FEx">Over the years, <em>Dead by Daylight </em>has moved away from solely using horror characters, and introduced more action- or thriller-oriented characters as well. Lara Croft is a popular choice for such crossovers; she appears in many other games, including Call of Duty, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Brawlhalla</em>, and <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p>
<p id="x1WrQV">The next licensed tie-in after Lara Croft will likely be the Castlevania crossover, announced earlier this year. Expect more info on the Castlevania chapter later this summer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-together-is-the-cruel-co-op-platformer-that%E2%80%99s-blowing-up-on-steam.911013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185778/chained-together-co-op-platformer-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9ihOp5">There’s a genre of game I lovingly call “antics generators” — games where the high points include players howling over voice chat and perfectly clippable moments to share on social media. <em>Lethal Company</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, and the Mario Party franchise are perfect examples of this phenomenon, and it looks like another contender is emerging: <em>Chained Together</em>, a co-op game about escaping hell with three of your buddies.</p>
<p id="qPfPW0"><em>Chained Together</em>, which has proved popular on Steam since it was released on June 19, has a simple premise: platform your way out of hell. The catch is — and you may have guessed this from the title of the game — that you and your friends are chained together. You can play solo or in a four-person squad, and the wackiest way to play is with a full team. </p>
<p id="CLK4BF">As you get out of hell, the climbing becomes increasingly difficult. Even if you play impeccably, a slip-up from one of your teammates sends all of you back to the depths of hell. It’s co-op <em>QWOP</em>.</p>

<p id="1RhzaG">This kind of game already does well on streaming — consider the success of <em>Getting Over It</em>, or the similar platformer <em>Only Up</em> — but when you add in the chaotic element of co-op, it gets very silly very quickly. There are sometimes moments where you save one of your pals with some lucky chain physics, and at that point you feel like a solid team made up of comrades. But most runs are defined by plummeting back into the depths as everyone shouts at each other.</p>
<p id="4AuYU5">There are ways to adjust the difficulty; a run can be much friendlier with the checkpoint system enabled, allowing you to try again from the highest point you’ve reached. Or, if you’re particularly devious, there’s a hard mode where lava chases you upward to make you climb faster. To many players, the tough circumstances are part of the charm — it allows for big saves and dramatic victories.</p>


<p id="eHobqQ">And for other players, the frustration is part of the fun. Having one of your friends doom you to a fall as everyone howls and hoots over voice chat is delightful. It’s chaotic and intense, and the first time I played it with friends it ended with us deciding to collectively rage quit. After cooling down, we agreed to schedule another night, because the fury was just part of the fun. But those frustrating moments of getting nailed out of nowhere with an obstacle, or missing a narrow platform, just make the success of climbing all the sweeter.</p>
<p id="YfyjiI"><em>Chained Together</em> is available for around $5, and it’s likely not an experience that can keep a group playing for months — but it’s a solid antics-heavy game that challenges players to overcome not just the map, but to work together as a team, even when someone misses their jump and pulls the group back down to the pits of hell.</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic has confirmed that Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be released on September 24th, and has also launched pre-orders for the collector’s edition. That edition of the Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will set you back $199.99/£174.99. Those who pre-order digitally will get a costume pack with three skins and 24 hours early access, but the caveat is that the early access is for consoles only. The standard version is priced at £49.99, though <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CW3N62GY?th=1">Amazon has priced it at £40.95</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopto.net/en/ps5di03-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-playstation-5-p1180965/">Shopto have it for £40.85</a>.</p>

<p>The collector’s edition of Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed will include a 28cm Mickey Mouse statue, n Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain, a vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign, six Disney Epic Mickey postcards, a Collector’s Steelbook, and the Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack.</p>
<p>The original Epic Mickey was released in November 2010 and follows Mickey as he breaks in to a world of “forgotten things”, concept art and animations for cartoons that never made it to the screen. The levels are loosely a based on locations at the Disneyland theme park, and Mickey will be tormented by Shadow Blot, a creature he created but based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey his original comic strips. A sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, followed in 2012.</p>


<p>In our review for the original Disney Epic Mickey, Dan said, <em>“Bitterly, bitterly disappointed is my summation of the last ten plus hours. At its core DEM is a solid game which flits between genius and mediocrity, yet is mired by a camera system that is fundamentally broken. Disney fans will find lots to love, as it is complete fan service, and there is a good story to enjoy. “</em></p>

  <p id="x8V3a3">There’s an arcade-themed bar near where I live in south London that has an original <em>Monkey Ball</em> cabinet. This classic 2001 Sega cab, which became a Nintendo GameCube launch game called <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, features a single banana-shaped joystick before an angled screen. Players use the banana to guide AiAi, a monkey in a ball, to the end of tricky platforming stages. It’s goofy, minimalist, and brilliant — even 23 years ago, it felt like a time warp back to the surreal innocence of early video games.</p>
<p id="UIFbt6">I played the shit out of <em>Super Monkey Ball </em>on the GameCube; it’s one of my favorite games ever. When I spotted the old cabinet in the bar, I had to try it. I didn’t do that well — the banana joystick had seen better days and was a bit slack, with a roomy dead zone. (Also, I was a few cocktails deep into my evening by that point.) But the game itself folded the preceding two decades down to nothing. The feel of the ball physics, the routes through the stages, the shortcuts with their risky ricochets and heart-in-mouth tumbles — all of it was still there, programmed into my muscle memory, ready and waiting to be revived by an instantly recognizable blast of cheery techno music.</p>
<p id="AhrAHV">Monkey Ball went on to become a modest franchise for Sega, fueled in part by the GameCube game’s addition of a suite of inventive, comical party games (Monkey Target, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, and more). But the perfection of the 2001 game’s original set of single-player stages turned out to be tough for the developers to follow. It’s difficult to elaborate meaningfully on something so simple and pure; every subsequent release ended up diluting it.</p>

<p id="AiE5sK">To make matters worse for Monkey Ball, the Sega team that made these games soon had another hit franchise on its hands, and it couldn’t have been more different: Yakuza, now called Like a Dragon. The studio that had once been called Amusement Vision, then CS1 R&amp;D, eventually renamed itself Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio after the Japanese name for its series of sprawling gangster melodramas.</p>
<p id="HNz4OO">RGG Studio didn’t have much time left for AiAi and his friends, and the series fell fallow for a while in the 2010s. But after remakes of the first three games and <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz</em> revived interest, RGG Studio decided to have another go. The result is <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>: a new release for Nintendo Switch, the first original Monkey Ball title in a decade, and a take on the series that’s simultaneously fresh and deeply nostalgic.</p>
<p id="WayJgr">The basics haven’t changed: Get to the goal before the time runs out and pick up bananas on the way. As ever, the trick to Super Monkey Ball is understanding that you’re really tilting the whole level rather than controlling the ball. <em>Banana Rumble</em> is super smooth (the adventure mode runs at a flawless 60 frames per second) and instinctive to play. The levels are pretty easy in the early part of the game, with lots of broad, safe platforms to roll along, and they tend toward interactive elements and away from the extremely tough balancing challenges of the original.</p>

<p id="PFlC0b">But RGG Studio has layered the difficulty with meta-challenges for each level — target completion time (usually just a few seconds), total bananas collected, and a golden banana to aim for — as well as a new spin dash move that can be charged up to give your simian orb an extra speed boost. Pressing a button in Monkey Ball? Sacrilege! …Although, just think of the shortcut opportunities it opens up.</p>
<p id="GpeF5t">“We looked to lower the difficulty level on the early worlds of Adventure Mode, but the new spin dash technique broadened the possibilities of how users can beat any given level and made each stage worth playing, even for advanced players,” director Daisuke Takahata told Polygon over email. Takahata leads a team at RGG that includes several Monkey Ball veterans, including Yukio Oda, a level designer who’s worked on many games in the series, all the way back to the original.</p>
<p id="byPlTy">“The Super Monkey Ball series uses a unique physics system that allows for the creation of essentially any type of level, and we are proud to say this approach is a wonderful way to stimulate the imagination of level designers,” Oda explained, also over email. “Even after looking back over 20 years, there are many levels that I think are very original. I think that the originality of the first <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is the DNA of the series, so I made <em>Banana Rumble</em> keeping all of this in mind while also trying to adapt it to the changing times and the needs of the players.”</p>

<p id="wYjMei">In their answers, Takahata and Oda made several references to responding to shifting tastes among players, and if <em>Banana Rumble</em> is more welcoming and flexible than Monkey Ball games used to be, that’s probably why. But Oda pointed out that players have been surprising the developers since day one. “I have been involved in the series for many years, and I feel that more than half of the shortcuts found so far were not intended at all by the level designer. We are often surprised to learn of these unexpected shortcuts through various online videos,” he said.</p>
<p id="gIbp9U">Some innovations don’t have the design impact you would expect, however. <em>Banana Rumble </em>supports four-player co-op in the adventure mode — essentially allowing four players to pool their efforts to beat a stage simultaneously — but Takahata says this didn’t really influence the level design at all. There’s also a 16-player battle mode, but its slow, choppy frame rate feels anathema to Monkey Ball play. This is one game series for which a solid 60 fps needs to be a baseline requirement.</p>
<p id="mUeLda">One of my greatest gaming memories is defeating the “0.1 string” on the Advanced 11 stage of the original <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. This simple but devious level is shaped like a guitar, presenting four “strings” — straight routes to the goal — of increasing narrowness. The 0.1 string is a tenth as wide as your monkey’s ball, and for a long time, it seemed impossible to me. But with patient coaching from a friend, I made it, and realized it had been quite simple all along; it wasn’t a test of skill, but a test of nerve.</p>

<p id="h1ZFwX">“If you still remember that stage today, it means that I was able to create a memorable level,” Oda said. “If I were to comment on that stage in particular, I would say the theme would be ‘courage and confidence,’ along with ‘challenging yourself and the sense of accomplishment that follows.’ When designing the most difficult stages, it is also important that it makes users think, ‘I almost beat it!’ and ‘So close!’ But if a stage is just too difficult, and you have no idea how to clear it, or if you fall down in an unreasonable way, it wouldn’t make you want to try again, right?”</p>
<p id="9IFMv9">It’s fun to think of Oda, who designed those brilliant, maddening stages back in 2001, returning to continue his life’s work, but surrounded by other developers making the street-brawling combat, loquacious cutscenes, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24050765/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-animal-crossing-minigame-dondoko-island-yakuza">bizarro minigames</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24047430/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-pc-xbox-ps5"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>. (Takahata said the Like a Dragon team helped playtest <em>Banana Rumble</em>, and their perspective helped with “the overall quality of the level design.”) The studio that made <em>Banana Rumble</em> has changed a lot over the last two decades, but the simple joy of the Monkey Ball series remains. It’s refreshed, even; <em>Banana Rumble</em> is the first new entry in a long while that feels more like a love letter than an obligation. Oda said one thing — perhaps the most important thing — about making Monkey Ball hasn’t changed at all over the last 20 years: “The fun we had while creating it has not changed in the slightest. :)” </p>

  <p id="epkcnr">When Spry Fox co-founder and studio director David Edery and his team set out to make a second <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22368702/cozy-grove-review-nintendo-switch-pc-animal-crossing-review">Cozy Grove</a> game, they wanted to mirror the first game, but “bigger and better.” The concept of the original game and its new sequel, <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em>, is simple: Each day, you check in on the bear spirits at camp, helping them accomplish tasks in exchange for wares and spirit logs, which feed and grow your fire, Flamey.</p>
<p id="LafvlX">When Flamey eats enough logs, new areas of the island get unlocked, with new spirits that reside there. Each day, you help the spirits return color to their sections of the map, learning stories of their living days as you go. Interactive elements like piles of leaves, fish, and bugs are randomly regenerated on the map, making the same areas intriguing to explore even after months of playing.</p>

<p id="JbmkeB">And if the satisfying task completion and foraging isn’t enough to hook you, the story likely will be. As a human camper from another realm, the player is in a unique position to help the ghostly bears, who share very human stories of loss, regret, and fear. Their tales are written in quippy dialogue that only serves to further endear them to you — and that’s to say nothing of the sweet symbolism of how they’re illustrated, molded into cubic shapes and blended with items from their past lives. </p>
<p id="98SZu5">As Edery said at a presser for <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em>, the games aren’t necessarily for children. In the new game, developed by Spry Fox and published by Netflix, one NPC shares about their struggle to communicate with their immigrant mother who speaks a different language. Another navigates a deep betrayal by their business partner.</p>

<p id="4PQcGn">The gameplay is much the same between the two games, though <em>Camp Spirit</em> incorporates lots of new elements and minigames like hosing down dirty buildings — and Edery said the studio plans to continue updating <em>Camp Spirit </em>as it learns more about how people are playing the game. (It has no plans to keep the original <em>Cozy Grove</em> updated at the moment, for the record.) </p>
<p id="I6z48S">Spry Fox certainly accomplished what it set out to do by expanding the game while also fixing some quirks of the original engine that led to limitations and bugs. <em>Camp Spirit </em>includes several buildings, for instance — not just your own tent, which was the only interior in <em>Cozy Grove</em>. </p>
<p id="gb9yRb">“By taking the time to rebuild major parts of the Cozy Grove codebase, we unlocked the ability to add more interior spaces and even whole new islands to the game, should we choose to do so,” Edery wrote in an email to Polygon. Those interiors, like the inside of Orsina’s caves or the packed-up remnants of Kumari’s failed business, leave room for novel illustrations that you wouldn’t see in the rest of the game, which is set outside.</p>

<p id="To5leD">The revamped code also allows for something <em>Cozy Grove</em> players have wanted for years: multiplayer. While I wasn’t able to test multiplayer before launch, the game introduced me to the mechanics via NPCs. Players will be able to see their friends on their islands asynchronously (as in, you can collaborate with them to forage better items at any time, not only when the other player is online).</p>
<p id="lBL4HD">There are still a few of those small glitches that occurred in the original game, like the occasional frame skip. But the main problem with <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em> has nothing to do with the game at all — it’s about the platform and publisher.</p>
<p id="B3ZaD3">The only way to play <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em> currently is by downloading the game on your app store and logging into your Netflix account when the app launches. If you don’t subscribe to Netflix, you can’t play the game.</p>
<p id="tZ9k4a">It’s unhelpful to criticize Spry Fox for any of this — Netflix acquired the studio outright in October 2022 — and Edery described the relationship as “a safe harbor in the storm” of the current games industry. According to Edery, the Netflix deal meant the devs and designers didn’t have to worry much about things like marketing the game — a huge win for what was once a small indie game.</p>
<p id="xHuh1I">But the way Netflix has decided to launch the game means that it’s currently only available on mobile (iOS and Android). To play <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em>, you must first download the Netflix app and log in. Then, go to games, click on <em>Camp Spirit</em>, and download the game, where you’ll log in to Netflix once more.</p>
<p id="E6LB4F">I tested <em>Camp Spirit</em> on my iPhone 15, using my touchscreen as my controller. It’s often fine. It’s also often cramped, if not occasionally frustrating. My finger covers up the grid when I use Decoration Mode to place items, and the UI overlaps with itself during certain actions, I assume due to the size of my screen. </p>

<p id="G0zWU0">The optional zoomed-out view makes this a bit better when you’re traversing your island, but it irks me that I couldn’t choose from the beginning to start my game on Steam for bigger screen real estate and WASD controls. (For what it’s worth, that’s coming from someone who plays mobile games daily.)</p>
<p id="rpEdoQ">“I can say that we definitely want Cozy Grove to be available on all the platforms that Netflix is, which of course, long-term, includes TVs and PCs/Macs,” Edery told Polygon. </p>
<p id="FhHakM">In terms of input, you can play with any controller compatible with your mobile device, or even an Apple Pencil, according to Edery. In the past, Polygon reporter Nicole Carpenter has posited that the original game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22375612/cozy-grove-apple-arcade-preferred-device-mobile">was actually better on mobile</a>, and Edery said the numbers back that up: “Given how well Cozy Grove did on Apple Arcade, my guess is that quite a lot of people are going to prefer playing with touch on a phone.”</p>
<p id="kffgK7">Those gripes aside, I can’t stress enough that if you already have a Netflix account, you’re going to want to play this game. The grind-to-fun ratio is excellent, and there’s so little pressure to log in that it actually motivates me to log in <em>more</em> — I’m simply thinking about my bears organically, rather than stressing about whether I’ll finish every daily task before the end of the day.</p>
<p id="4egUfu">In that sense, mobile is a fitting platform for <em>Camp Spirit</em>, because the game isn’t meant to take up hours upon hours of your life (try me, Spry Fox). “We’re a game that folds into your life — you have a lot of other obligations,” lead designer Alicia Fortier said during the <em>Camp Spirit</em> press event. </p>
<p id="lSwLgO">Rather than playing on your starved dopamine receptors like tons of other mobile games do, <em>Camp Spirit </em>isn’t so desperate for your attention. The feeling I get while playing the game, whether I’m standing still and listening to the music while I write game reviews or hunting feverishly for a lost item I’ve been looking for all day, is that the island exists whether I’m there or not — but the bears really like it when I’m there. </p>

Of course for owners of the new expansion, the inclusion of <em>Dawntrail</em>’s new quests, jobs, and continent is the big draw, but this massive patch brings a lot of new features for all players. The standout is the graphical update to the game, which has been a long time coming for the decade-old MMO. While character models and certain weapons, gear, and environments will get the update, you might not see drastic changes across all of Eorzea. That’s because the graphical update will apply to <em>Dawntrail</em> content first, with other parts of the game getting texture upgrades later down the line. So you might not see prettier trees while running old content but your Viera will look much better.</p><p>On the topic of looking good, you will now be able to dye gear with two colors! There are also new hairstyles to play with in the graphical update. And if you’re thinking you might want to change up your character’s look in more significant ways at some point, don’t miss out on the new quest “Bottled Fantasy” in Uldah that is being added with 7.0. This will be available to all players who have finished the “The Scions of the Seventh Dawn” main quest from <em>A Realm Reborn </em>and grant a free Fantasia, which can be used to change your race at any time. If you want to try out playing as a female Hrothgar, pick this quest up ASAP. </p><p>A small quality-of-life change for players still completing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span> is a reduction in the number of Aether Currents in that expansion’s maps, which you previously needed to find all 10 of in a given area before you could fly there. We don’t know the new number but anybody who has met the new requirement will immediately unlock the ability to fly in each area. And for those exploring <em>Dawntrail</em> (now or when the full release drops), an absolutely incredible new setting will let you hide nearby players when close to quest-related NPCs. That means no more trying to click through hordes of players crowding that one guy you need to click to move forward.</p><p>Finally, Square Enix has implemented a change to the annoying stealth missions expansions tend to have. These are missions that require you to follow an NPC and stay out of sight as well as a certain distance away from them. The distance and sight line are not indicated in any real way, which led to players constantly having to start these frustrating missions over. Patch 7.0 changes this by adding indicators for sight line and distance.</p><p>There are a lot more small bug fixes and tweaks to the many systems of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> in patch 7.0.

<p>Playground Games has announced that Forza Horizon 4 is set to be delisted from digital storefronts worldwide at the end of the year due to licensing issues. It was confirmed in a recent blog post that the game will be taken offline from December 15, 2024, making both the game and any additional contact unavailable for purchase on digital stores on Xbox and PC. </p>



<p>From today, Forza Horizon 4’s DLC will be delisted, with the full game being taken down in several months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road</h2>



<p><a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">Playground Games and Microsoft confirmed</a> that discounts will be offered across the Forza Horizon 4 suite, making the game a little more affordable before it’s inevitably pulled offline later in 2024. It was stressed that existing players will still be able to access their game after December 15, but no new users will be able to get involved with the platform.</p>



<p>It was also revealed that users who played Forza Horizon 4 through Game Pass and who purchased DLC will receive ‘a game token’ as compensation. </p>



<p>It was then said that the game’s final series – Series 77 – will start on July 25 and that it’ll usher in the last Festival Playlist for the game, which will debut on August 22. Following that, there will be no more content added to the game, the playlist menu will disappear, and only a skeleton platform will remain in terms of events until December 15, when the game is delisted.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 4 was released in 2018 and has since been ‘replaced’ by Forza Horizon 5, which was released to an overwhelmingly popular reception in 2021.</p>

<p>If you find yourself craving a little Destiny 2 in the middle of the work week, well, you’re not alone. Unfortunately, it appears Destiny 2 is down for maintenance. Developer Bungie revealed its maintenance schedule for the day, and the servers will remain down for a few hours total.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-destiny-2-down">How Long is Destiny 2 Down?</h2>



<p>Currently, Destiny 2 is down for maintenance as part of update 8.0.0.5. In total, it will take approximately four hours to complete the maintenance, and the official timeline is:</p>



<ul>
<li>6:00 AM PDT — Destiny 2 maintenance begins; sign-on and game integration features unavailable.</li>



<li>6:45 AM PDT — Destiny 2 was completely brought offline for maintenance, and players were removed from online activities.</li>



<li>10:00 AM PDT — Destiny 2 update is available on all platforms and regions. Players may log back into Destiny 2, and queue times may increase as a result.</li>



<li>12:00 PM PDT — Destiny 2 maintenance concludes, and console players should reset their systems to download the update.</li>
</ul>



<p>All in all, it’s a relatively short period of downtime in Destiny 2. If you were itching to play, however, then you’ll likely find that no other game satisfies in the meantime. I’m right there with you, as I was about to boot up the game when I received the notice!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-info-on-destiny-2-s-servers">Where to Find Info on Destiny 2’s Servers</h2>



<p>First and foremost, the best place to check on the status of Destiny 2’s servers is via the <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/sections/360010290272-Destiny-Troubleshooting-Guides" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official help section on their website</a>. It offers a ton of useful information about servers and update statuses, maintenance updates, and more.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can <a href="https://x.com/BungieHelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">check the studio’s X</a> (formerly Twitter) for up-to-date information on the game’s servers and live status.</p>

I am glad to be here today.”</p><p><strong>Let’s talk first about the game’s story. Can you share more details about the origins of the strange Mud that has spread all over the world and how it shaped the last city of mankind known as <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a>swell?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Let us find the answer in the game.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Hmm, OK. So who are the Bladers, and what went into their creation?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “The Bladers are the only ‘life force’ symbols of the wasteland. I hope their appearance can reflect this idea. They should be vivid and bright, yet not disconnected from the desolation and decay of the wasteland city. Take, for example, Arrisa, our protagonist. She originally had long, bright pink hair in the early designs. As we delved deeper into the game’s world and developed more details, we realized that as a Blader who has spent years crawling and fighting, her appearance should reflect her athleticism more. Therefore, Arrisa now sports cool, short, light pink hair (not white!). Her attire has also evolved from exquisite tailoring to a more post-apocalyptic mix-and-match style, reflecting the limited fashion choices in the barren wasteland.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you tell us about the “wide variety and number of weapons” players will have access to? How many or what kind of weapons can players look forward to?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “The game has approximately 20 to 30 types of weapons in total. The variety of weapons provides different combat styles and pacing, making combat experiences more diverse. Few of them have been in the previous trailer released on Jananuary 19. For example, the Straight Sword is an all-round weapon with balanced features. The Double Swords are a fast, aggressive attacker. We will disclose more weapons in the future, such as the scythe and Tachi.”</p><p><strong>How does the transformation mechanism in the Blader’s left hand affect combat strategies?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Arrisa’s left hand can use special Blader’s abilities, such as Spells and skills. Spells, skills, and weapons combined will bring countless fighting styles for players to try. For example, the skill ‘Counter Field’ is similar to ‘parrying.’ It can neutralize enemies’ attacks and then initiate a counterattack. Another skill, ‘Piercing Claw,’ enhances Arrisa’s rage for a more powerful attack upon enemies. There is also a laser-like spell that allows Arrisa to perform long-range attacks to handle different scenarios. These are just a small sample of the skills and spells available. Players will have a wide range of choices to create their own fighting style. If you are interested in seeing more in the future, check our <a href="https://twitter.com/ailimit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X account</a>.”</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the game’s synchronization system and what role it plays in combat?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Sync Rate replaces the Stamina in Soulslike games. This change encourages players to focus more on their quick thinking and adaptability in combat.”</p><p>(<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> We asked for further clarification on the Sync Rate system—what it is and how it encourages players to focus more on “quick thinking and adaptability” when compared to the Stamina system seen in other Soulslike games—but a public relations representative interjected to clarify that more information will be shared in the leadup to the game’s launch.)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Is combat slow and tactical, or fast and combo-based? If you could compare it to any existing game systems, what would be the closest match?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “On combat pacing, Arrisa is more agile compared to your average cursed undead in <em>Dark Souls</em>, yet more grounded compared to fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [1,959 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>. It’s roughly positioned between <em>Dark Souls III</em> and <em><a title="Games > Bloodborne [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>, although individual experiences may vary. Overall, the action performance is quite agile, and the cancellation of recovery animations and aimed stop have been adjusted to a more lenient degree. We hope that players will not feel overwhelmed by enemies in terms of basic attributes, and that the confrontations with enemies will return to a test of skill and mentality.”</p><p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the game’s variety of enemies and the process behind designing them?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Because Arrisa, the protagonist, has relatively strong combat abilities compared to other Soulslike games, we have also designed equally capable enemies. Take the Necros, one of the enemy factions in the game, as an example. Necro is a general term for a type of monster that wreaks havoc throughout the city. Their signatures include spikes, blades, tentacles, silver shells, and insect-like wings, symbolizing chaos and slaughter.”</p><p><strong>Are enemies unique in that different strategies are required to defeat different foes?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Please allow me to continue use Necros as an example. They possess overwhelming strength. Some move with swift and eerie agility, making them elusive and hard to predict. Others have sharp claws and blades that not only deal damage but also inflict very troublesome status effects. Some can harness extremely dense energy to create explosions and rays… Even with enhanced mobility, the onslaught of Necros is by no means easy for players to withstand. Only by leveraging all resources and mastering every aspect of the combat system can one hope to survive this rebellious wasteland.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>How does the narrative integrate into the game? Are there cutscenes and story-focused elements, or is the story mostly told through world interaction?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “<em>AI LIMIT</em> focused more on gameplay rather than cinematic elements. The game doesn’t have too many ‘force you to watch’ sections. Even if players don’t talk to NPCs at all, they can still beat the game. However, interacting with NPCs allows you to make choices that determine the direction of the story. I hope the different endings provide you with meaningful experiences.”</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge the development team faced during the game’s development?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “For a first-time developer, the complexity of the entire project exceeded our expectations. The further we progressed; the more technical issues arose. At certain points in development, iterating on technology caused challenges with maintenance and <a title="Genres > Management [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>. Looking back, we recognize that many of these issues stemmed from our lack of experience as first-timers. However, all of that is now in the past. We believe the game will soon be ready to see the world.”</p><p><strong>How has being part of the China Hero Project program benefitted development?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “<a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,853 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> offers project management advice and opportunities for market exposure and brand promotion, which are very important to us. Sony Interactive Entertainment also provides middleware, QA, and sound support, plus consulting from <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,383 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studios, all for free. I deeply appreciate it.”</p><p><strong>Outside of publishing the game, how did <a title="Companies > CE-Asia [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ce-asia">CE-Asia</a> help support development?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “As the publisher, CE-Asia has provided us with extensive support, including financial backing, marketing, quality assurance, and improvement advice. They are currently managing the global distribution for both console and PC versions of the game, ensuring it gets rated worldwide. Additionally, they are showcasing our game at gaming exhibitions in different regions. Thanks to their assistance, my team can focus on game development.</p><p>“I would also like to extend special thanks to Mr. Wu, the CEO of CE-Asia. With over twenty years of experience in the gaming industry, he has a wealth of knowledge. During our collaboration, he has identified many issues we hadn’t considered, helping our team avoid numerous pitfalls and ensuring the smooth progress of our development work.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>What aspects of the game are you proudest of? What do you hope players will take away after their time with the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “To make the fictional world of <em>AI LIMIT</em> more convincing, we put a lot of effort into building this world. We ensured that the content in the game reflects the setting and enhances the player’s immersion. Vegetation is usually used to fill in scene details for the game. However, in <em>AI LIMIT</em>, vegetation has gone extinct, so this method could not be used. We came up with other ways to construct the scenes. Although it was quite challenging, we persevered and made it work.”</p><p><strong>Did any other titles serve as an inspiration for <em>AI LIMIT</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “It is hard to point out one game as the main inspiration. However, I drew a lot of inspiration from classic Japanese works such as <em>GHOST IN THE SHELL</em>, <em>BLAME!</em>, and <em>AKIRA</em>. Additionally, I incorporated some interesting designs into the game.”</p><p><strong>Before we sign off, is there anything you would like to say to players looking forward to <em>AI LIMIT</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Thank you all for your love for <em>AI LIMIT</em>! The <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,586 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> with Arrisa to Havenswell awaits. I hope you will enjoy this game. Stay tuned!”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Yang Bin!</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.</p>

<p>Thirsty Suitors,&nbsp;a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."</p>

<p>As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.</p>

The jumbo-sized macro pad has 32 customizable LCD keys for controlling various functions on a Windows PC or Mac. It’s a staple among enthusiast and high-level Twitch streamers, but its customizability makes it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23700541/stream-deck-hacks-uses">incredibly handy for all sorts of desktop and laptop users</a>.</p><p>Want a button for quickly muting yourself on a Zoom call or to promptly summon Spotify? No problem. How about a series of buttons for controlling audio functions or emotes in your favorite game? With 32 keys, you have enough for a whole bunch of helpful tools at your disposal, or you can fill some with silly and superfluous things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23706779/stream-deck-pop-bubbles-bubbledeck">popping fake bubble wrap</a>.

Google’s flagship thermostat may be a little long in the tooth, but it remains a great option for a smart home gadget designed to save you money on your heating and cooling bills.

That price is also about $119 better than the C3’s typical discounted price in this size. The C3 is last year’s midrange OLED from LG, but it remains an excellent option for watching movies, TV shows, or playing games. It’s got excellent color contrast with HDR, and in addition to those deep, inky blacks on most OLEDs, it also supports up to 120Hz on each of its four HDMI 2.1 ports.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC yet hovers at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">Mixed</a> in the blood-encrusted annals of the Steam user review consensus. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">wrote earlier in the week</a>, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.</p>
<p>As publishers Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043">sweetly observed</a>, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.</p><!--more-->
<p>Here to save the day and reconcile the warring parties are the modders and in particular, Sereenaty, whose <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5263?tab=description">Normalized DLC damage</a> mod (thanks, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elden-ring-mod-remove-shadow-of-erdtree-scadutree-system">VG247</a>) adjusts damage dealt and received within the DLC areas to be more in line with the base game, theoretically doing away with the need for Scadutree Fragments. As the modder sums up, "if you're tired of having your entire build thrown in the Trash just because you're not into collectibles, this mod is for you". The mod also swaps out the bulk of the game's Scadutree Fragments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-great-runes-divine-towers">Rune Arcs</a>, though you'll apparently still receive a few Fragments from enemy drops.</p>
<p>My schadenfreude about the internet's git-gudders being hoisted by their own quote-dunks aside, I don't have a magic disappearing goat in this particular Elden horse race. I haven't played Shadow Of The Erdtree yet, partly because a lot of people at the Treehouse are already playing it and partly because I'm more interested these days in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lxd-red-honey-is-an-astonishingly-good-free-metroidvania-that-owes-something-to-psychedelic-bees">psychedelic bee products</a>. Still, I'm interested in the angle that searching for Fragments in Erdtree is a chore you must undertake if you want to make headway, and how that differs from the experience of levelling a character by gathering runes. If you're playing, I'm keen to know whether you feel like you're being forced to search for them, or whether discovering them is coming about as part of routine exploration, which is the major thrill of any From Software game for me.</p>
<p>People who don't want to mod Erdtree and also don't want to be speared and barbecued by any given foe should definitely check out our guides section. Ollie, Kiera and Jeremy have put together <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations">a list of all 50 Scadutree Fragments and their locations</a>. They also strongly recommend that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order">fight Erdtree's bosses in this order</a>. Forget modders - guides writers are the true champions of the realm. They git gud only to ensure that we might git gud in turn.</p>

BioWare has been focusing a lot of its marketing push for the sequel on the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">party of seven heroes</a></span>, each of whom embodies a different faction within the universe and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">will be a romance option</a></span>. But where will these new characters fall in the pantheon of the series? <em>Dragon Age</em>’s companions are arguably the most well-regarded thing about the franchise, as is pretty standard for BioWare games. It’s got us thinking, who are the best characters in each <em>Dragon Age </em>game? Rather than creating an unwieldy list of 30+ characters spanning the entire series thus far, we decided to break them up between games. Here’s our ranking of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>party members and advisors, from worst to best.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It is incredibly fitting that Cole, the spirit of compassion who can join the Inquisition, has the ability to make people forget about him, because that dude is unfortunately a pretty forgettable guy. Cole is by no means a bad character, but his story doesn’t quite live up to the highs of his peers. Cole’s existence as something in between a spirit and a human, and how he chooses to lean into one path or the other, creates some interesting routes for the character, but it ultimately hits with the same fervor as a fairly forgettable side quest. He’s good! He’s just unremarkable against the competition.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Josephine Montilyet is the only advisor in <em>Inquisition </em>who fans didn’t have an established relationship with prior to the 2014 RPG, and she still managed to carve out her place in their hearts. As the Inquisition’s resident diplomat, Josie is always thinking practically where Cullen might send soldiers to handle a problem and Leliana would cut its throat. As her story unfolds, it’s revealed that the most buttoned-up character in Skyhold has a bit of a wild side, but is still a fan of the finer things in life, like theater and team base gossip. Despite her political expertise, Josie is one of the most grounded, charismatic characters in <em>Inquisition</em>. Her story isn’t about some massive faction or world-shattering event, it’s about a girl who is trying to make sense of a world where dragons roam and people can shoot fire from their hands.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sera, the elven rogue and Friend of Red Jenny, is an acquired taste. She’s impulsive, disruptive, and judgemental, but she is a product of the world she’s been raised in. As a city elf, Sera has seen the worst of how Thedas treats elves and anyone who isn’t seen as part of the upper class. She’s rebellious and pursues her idea of justice with reckless abandon. That means she’s also a source of tension and drama as she butts heads with anyone who doesn’t fit her idea of what elves should be. Sera is thorny but that’s what makes her delightful when you get closer to her, letting you look past the manic angst and see someone who wants things to be better.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-recommend-id="image://ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-recommend-id="image://ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As one of the few characters to appear in every <em>Dragon Age</em> game, Cullen’s role as one of the three advisors in <em>Inquisition</em> is the culmination of every story we’ve seen him pass through. This is a man who started out dedicated to the church and his calling as a mage-fighting Templar just to watch it fail him and others time and time again. Like several other characters in <em>Inquisition</em>, Cullen reckons with who he is after the systems he bought into have fallen apart. Depending on the player’s actions, he can grow from all he’s endured in <em>Origins </em>and <em>Dragon Age II</em>, or he can succumb to the rot the church put inside him. He’s an effective symbol for the failing systems of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and an excellent reminder that its people and the world they live in are not beyond saving.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-recommend-id="image://8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-recommend-id="image://8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At this point, Varric has become a face for the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, if not <em>the </em>face after appearing prominently in three games.

Varric has gone from a simple roguish businessman in Kirkwall to a storyteller recanting some of the biggest moments in history to anyone who will listen. He has become so world-weary by the time of <em>Inquisition </em>but he’s never lost hope. His personal questline isn’t world-shattering, but it’s a reminder that this man has been dragged through unprecedented times, and will continue to be so as we head into <em>The Veilguard </em>this fall. He deserves rest. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">I hope he gets it</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-recommend-id="image://bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leliana talks to the Inquisitor.

Some of this was explained retroactively through epilogues, but those did little to alleviate feelings of the spymaster being one of BioWare’s seemingly unkillable favorites. Though she serves as a case study in <em>Dragon Age</em>’s complicated relationship with continuity, Leliana’s story in <em>Inquisition</em>, much like Cullen’s, shows one of the few mainstays of each <em>Dragon Age </em>game finally becoming who they were always meant to be. After saving the world once, Leliana has gone from the once soft-spoken bard to a cunning agent of the Inquisition. She is disenfranchised from the church, but not the people she served alongside. She has the potential to become the leader of the church within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe, and depending on whether you push her to remain compassionate or steel herself, her reign can be paved with kindness or blood. <em>Inquisition </em>is all about watching the world change and seeing the people who make it happen become who they’re supposed to be, and despite the series-wide complications, Leliana shines once more in her third appearance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been a lot of Qunari throughout the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but none have made an impression quite like Iron Bull. The mercenary is a double agent, but he’s refreshingly upfront about it when you meet him. He’s a fun-loving warrior who likes to drink, kill dragons, bro about with his team, and fuck. But despite his seemingly one-track mind, Iron Bull is one of the only characters who can actually betray you if you give him a reason to. Depending on your choices in the main game, Iron Bull may turn on you during the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC with seemingly no remorse; even if you’ve entered a romantic relationship with him. The Qunari spy told you who he was, and he will still be that by the end if you don’t give him a reason to be anyone else. You can’t judge a book by its cover, even if the title on the spine tells you everything you need to know.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blackwall, or a man going by that name, is one of the most slept-on characters in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. He is initially believed to be a Grey Warden sent to find people to join their Darkspawn-killing ranks. It turns out, however, that he’s not a Warden at all, but a man named Thom Rainer who took on the name after the true Warden Blackwall recruited and was then killed protecting him. Rainer, believing his life otherwise forfeit, assumed Blackwall’s identity and strove to continue his work as a Warden. But in taking another man’s identity, he sought to erase his own, including his past crimes and treachery. As the guilt of his past failings catches up to him, Blackwall’s story can go multiple ways. He can accept his punishment, be given to the Wardens, or be given freedom to atone without hiding. A lot of those big reveals have gone unnoticed by fans because they’re buried under a story that feels like that of a pretty standard, overly stoic fantasy RPG warrior. Once all is said and done, though, Blackwall’s story is a pretty damn effective tale of owning up to one’s mistakes, and proudly being better.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-recommend-id="image://ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-recommend-id="image://ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame that Vivienne, one of the only mages who isn’t opposed to the Circle of Magi, the mage prison masquerading as a school in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, wasn’t in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, the game that had the war between mages and their Templar keepers at the center of its story. As much as I disagree with Vivienne’s beliefs on a fundamental level, I can’t help but be drawn in by the nuance. Vivienne is a mage who fully admits that she and people like her are dangerous, and a system like the Circle could probably alleviate everyone’s problems, but not in its current form. Whereas <em>Dragon Age II</em> paints mages as an oppressed class of people (while also simultaneously believing that they are inevitably going to become threats to society no matter what you do), Vivienne’s view of the situation is far more complex, and it makes you wonder if the catastrophic events of <em>Dragon Age II</em> might have gone very differently if only someone like her had been in Kirkwall. As a person who plays a mage in all of these games, hearing her condescend to me when I say mages should be free still feels like a particularly bad case of tinnitus, but she at least is talking more sensibly about the situation than anyone else in the room, all while having to shoulder her own personal burdens. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s inability to sit with that nuance has been the undoing of a lot of its world-building. It needed a character like Vivienne two games ago.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Religious upheaval is a central theme of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and no companion embodies that more than Cassandra. She’s the first character the Inquisitor gets in their party, and she is immediately suspicious of you. As far as she can tell, you are a symbol of everything she knows of the world changing. If you’re unwilling to play along with her worldview, any potential friendship between the two of you can sour almost immediately. How is she supposed to support the Inquisition when the person at its center is a heretic? Her reckoning only unravels further as she learns that the organization she has followed for most of her life has been corrupt, oppressing mages in ways deemed inhumane by even <em>Dragon Age </em>standards. Cassandra is one of the most devout people we’ve met in a series full of radicals, and yet while she struggles with the truths laid before her, she doesn’t shy away from them in the end. It would be so easy for a weaker person to retreat, deny the truth, and become stagnant. Cassandra watches the world change and decides to change with it.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-recommend-id="image://7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-recommend-id="image://7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, Solas is one of the less remarkable characters in <em>Inquisition</em>’s roster. He’s characterized by his knowledge of Fade-related magic, has some cool hat tricks to show you in his early conversations, and altogether seems a bit smug and judgy. Things start to change, though, as he reveals he is the source of Big Bad Corypheus’ magic. He shows frustration with the ways of the modern world, his personal quests solidify and reinforce his anger at how flippantly people view spirits, and when all is said and done, he leaves the Inquisition without a word. Then it’s revealed why Solas feels like a person out of time: He is the Dread Wolf, an elven trickster god having awoken to find himself written in history as a traitor to his people. Solas reveals in <em>Trespasser </em>that he barely viewed his friends in the Inquisition as people, and was using them to further his plan to tear down the Veil that separates the real world from the spirit one and bring back the elves’ long-lost immortality. That all changed as he grew to care for the friends he made along the way, but his mission can’t bend to newfound sentimentality. Underneath Solas’ pompous exterior is a man ravaged by guilt for what he did several millennia ago. Should he succeed in tearing down the Veil he created, that guilt will be replaced with a new one as he watches the world burn to correct his mistake. We’ll see what happens in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but <em>Inquisition </em>sets him up as the most compelling antagonist the series has ever put forth.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-recommend-id="image://d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-recommend-id="image://d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Throughout <em>Dragon Age</em>, the land of the Tevinter Imperium has been almost exclusively framed as a culturally homogenous, villainous place where mages rule without opposition, slavery is commonplace, and unspeakable evils made it the origin point of one of the Blight, one of the most ruinous phenomenon in the universe. Most of our frame of reference is from characters who were suffering at the ground level, at least until Dorian Pavus struts into view in <em>Inquisition</em>. By all accounts, Dorian should be thrilled with his setup in Tevinter. He’s the son of a powerful family, has been given every resource to nurture his magical talents, and is pretty much guaranteed a spot at the top of the country’s politics. But he is also his own man, and does not wish to cave to the life his family envisions for him. That includes standing proud as a gay man unwilling to continue his family’s bloodline, even as he is threatened with a magical take on conversion therapy at the hands of his own father.</p><p>Dorian escapes his home in Tevinter and is clearly jaded by the time he meets the Inquisitor. But as he watches the world change before him, how can he view his home country that, despite everything, he still loves? The <em>Dragon Age </em>series has often fallen into cynical cycles of scorching the earth, as if it can’t conceive of a better option. Dorian Pavus has been put through hell and back in Tevinter. He could have easily been a cautionary tale for how his home country is just as terrible as everyone in the series has ever told us. But instead, he’s a shining beacon proclaiming that it doesn’t have to be this way. Whether or not Dorian shows up in <em>The Veilguard</em>, which takes place partially in Tevinter, remains to be seen, but in <em>Inquistion</em>, he is radical hope personified. He is living, breathing proof that history is defined by those who believe that a better world is possible.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Walking into a Walmart or Target and seeing the game section made up almost exclusively of download codes makes my gamer spirit cry out in anguish. By the same token, any time a physical edition of a new game or an old classic gets announced I get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside again. Limited Run Games recently held a showcase that announced a bunch of physical editions for all types of games, including the tragically ill-fated, one-of-a-kind PlayStation 1 sequel: <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>.<br></p><p>During a 30 minute presentation, the Embracer-owned boutique distribution label Limited Run Games announced 26 upcoming releases it will be manufacturing discs and cartridges for, including some that were remastered  using its own proprietary Carbon Engine for layering retro emulation. I have no idea if works well or not, but I hope it means they got the love, attention, and respect they deserved. </p><p>There wasn’t a whole lot of information on pricing or release dates for some of the physical editions, but it’s still a nice heads-up. Now anyone who wants a physical copy can hold out for when those become available instead of double-dipping with the digital version too. After all, fans have waited decades for some of these games. What’s a few more months (or god forbid, years). </p><p>  <em>Tomba! 2</em> was the highlight, for sure. Joining Limited Run’s previously announced physical edition for the first <em>Tomba!</em>, the sequel brought the colorful PS1 platformer into a hybrid world of linear paths and 3D environments. It was a bold experiment that left the team behind it, Whoopee Camp, shuttered following its lackluster sales, though creator Tokuro Fujiwara recently directed the 2021 nostalgia trip <em>Ghosts ‘n Goblins Resurrection </em>and has provided his blessing to <em>Tomba!</em>’s return. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2b96df6601906d4702a45f73a7131a5" data-recommend-id="image://b2b96df6601906d4702a45f73a7131a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Penny rides a yo-yo in Penny's Big Breakaway.

When will these updates come? "[Solo mode] will be improved once we improve this feature," head of community and global brand director Almir Listo said in a developer update <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r26hIijRoRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You will still be required to start the game while online in Solo Mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature.</p></div><p>"It's not our full vision for this feature," he began. "For now, we're setting it as a beta to see how it runs. We expect the performance to be affected since the parts normally frontloaded by our servers will now have to be run on your own hardware.</p><p>"It will work though, and you can get progression that will update you once you return online. You will still be required to start the game while online in Solo Mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature. For now though, we want to test that the features that went into this work work properly."</p><p>The initial release of the Solo Mode Beta will be released as part of a greater patch to go alongside the Boys in Blue update, which adds a new playable character, weapons, and more on June 27, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Payday 3 Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Payday 3's launch in September 2023 was somewhat of a disaster, plagued with server issues that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-devs-ceo-apologizes-for-server-issues-at-launch">forced then Starbreeze CEO Tobias Sjögren to apologise</a>. "We are so sorry that the infrastructure didn't hold up as expected, and although it's impossible to prepare for every scenario — we should be able to do better," he said (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starbreeze-ceo-out-after-payday-3-disaster">but has now left the company</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologises-for-lack-of-communication-as-mid-october-first-patch-still-a-no-show">Almost a month after its launch and Starbreeze apologised again</a> for its lack of communication, and then just a week later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologises-for-radio-silence-explains-mia-first-patch">said sorry one more time for not delivering a promised patch</a> and again going quiet.
