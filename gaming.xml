            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry has returned with a new "system face-off" video – this time putting Nintendo's hybrid hardware, the Switch 2, up against Valve's PC handheld, the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the video above, you can see how the Switch 2 holds up against the Steam Deck OLED model across various "head-to-head" match-ups, including battery life, form factor, controller design, as well as OS and software availability.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie acknowledges how there are some obvious similarities, but also notes how these are two very different systems at the end of the day. Here are his closing thoughts, if you don't get the chance to watch the full video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think the Switch 2 is better as a console-like device than the Steam Deck is. It offers a streamlined, stress-free experience for playing controller-oriented games, the OS is rock solid, it docks perfectly, and it has great exclusive games - it's a more enjoyable, delightful machine to use moment to moment, if you want a slick gaming experience, it's hard to go wrong here, but it doesn't have the flexibility of a PC handheld, it can't access thousands upon thousands of PC games, you can't add special launch parameters, change up settings, swap refresh rates, or check out performance overlays, and you don't have the control options to make cursor oriented software work on the go. So, each machine has its strengths.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2 is a great machine to enjoy a game like Cyberpunk 2077 or exclusives like Mario Kart World or Fast Fusion, but a game like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 benefits enormously from having trackpad input, and the deck can play a larger vaiety of software, including older games that will probably never get a Switch 2 release. It's kind of an intractable battle, a fight between a console and essentially a PC in a console suit. Personal preferences and priorities are going to dictate this one, but I think most gamers will find a lot to like in both devices."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it comes down to what's best for you, along with your personal preferences, according to Digital Foundry. If you're eager to see more, Digital Foundry has also done comparisons of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and investigated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-tests-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation">Switch 2's GameCube emulation</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-still-a-space-ninja-game-technically-is-now-drawing-inspiration-from-world-war-i.1248144/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Wait, so what kind of game is <em>Warframe</em>, exactly?” is a common refrain among people who don’t play <em>Warframe</em>, upon hearing someone try to explain <em>Warframe</em>. So here, let me help: The sci-fi space ninja shooter’s previous expansion took players to the year 1999, where – by <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating a bunch of hot people</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listening to boy band music</a> – they uncovered key revelations about the nature of the universe. How do you follow that? Easy: World War I-inspired anime fights.</p><p>This only makes slightly more sense in context than out of it, but the beauty of <em>Warframe </em>is that it is constantly, sometimes to its own detriment, trying shit. The end result is a broad emotional palette, a decade-running narrative that can detour into tongue-in-cheek ‘90s-stalgia before pivoting back into a tale of war, woe, and what happens when one group attempts to subjugate all others. The game’s next narrative quest expansion, <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/tennocon-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Old Peace</em></a> launches later this year and takes place during the war between the Orokin, the ancient civilization that set the game’s whole story into motion, and the Sentients, Orokin creations that ultimately turned on their masters after being thrust into the dangerous Tau system. The Tenno, Orokin child soldiers forced to psychically pilot flesh mechs (and <em>Warframe</em>’s player faction), end up stuck in the middle.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TennoCon 2025 | The Old Peace | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfoypaVNGuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Ultimately, <em>Warframe </em>will head to an entire new solar system – the aforementioned, long-whispered-about Tau – in 2026, but this quest sets the stage by letting players venture into Tau’s past.&nbsp;</p><p>“We're really going to lean into themes of true war, and that's the state you left this moon and Tau in,” creative director Rebb Ford told Aftermath. “That way, when you go back there, you'll recognize everything in the same way a battle of old would be recognized."&nbsp;</p><p>True to <em>Warframe</em>’s name, other narrative quests have already depicted the conflict that took place during that era; this one explores a brief, brittle period of peace. A demo, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSqwET8-P-Q&amp;t=21575s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted today at TennoCon</a> in London, Ontario, shows one of the game’s lithe not-quite-cyborg ninjas sliding and soaring through trenches straight out of World War I as fire rains down. This turns out to be a training exercise between a Tenno and their Sentient schoolmate Adis, but the choice of imagery is no coincidence. World War I influences, creative director Rebb Ford told Aftermath, are more than skin deep.</p><p>“I’ve been kind of addicted to reading World War I novels,” she said. “[We’re going to explore] the idea that war happens so quickly when people make a decision that impacts the peace and armistice.”</p><p>As far as players understood previously, the Orokin and Sentinels fought bitterly, the Tennos turned the tide, and that was that. The idea that the two sides buried the hatchet, even briefly, is new to this expansion.</p><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches,” lead writer Adrian Bott told Aftermath. “That all-too-brief moment of commonality between enemies and recognizing something in one another – the idea of playing in this environment of trenches and devastation."</p><p>Of course, <em>The Old Peace</em> is not a 1:1 World War I story (space ninjas tend to get in the way of that), but the developers at Digital Extremes want players to recognize that every war past and present is a tragedy – specifically, a human one.</p><p>"I learned to be a storyteller through tourism and teaching history, and in that sense, when you forget to tell the human story inside history and abstract it to just names and dates, that's where teaching history in schools goes wrong,” principal writer Kat Kingsley told Aftermath. “When you just say 'Then this number of people died, and it happened on this day,' it just goes in one ear and out the other. One thing I think <em>Warframe </em>does really well is, it takes these epic sci-fi fantasy stories and tells them from a human aspect. It connects them to human emotions, even if they involve the wildest science fiction characters. I think with this update, we're telling a war story from a [place] of human emotion."</p><figure><blockquote><p>That all-too-brief moment of commonality between enemies and recognizing something in one another – the idea of playing in this environment of trenches and devastation.</p></blockquote></figure><p>As a result, the developers focused more on studying individuals’ battlefield horror stories, rather than the history books.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've not delved into things like historical records, the kind of thing that could distance you,” said Bott. “I've really tried much more to refresh my familiarity with [war poets], the men who were on the ground describing things. I think the idea of war poetry in itself might seem ironic, but it's not rendering something brutal whimsical in the slightest. It was finding a way to communicate what Wilfred Owen calls 'the pity of war distilled.' ... Drawing attention to it and saying 'This is the reality of what we suffer. This is what war is. This is what we went through.'"</p><p><em>Warframe </em>also boasts a long history of using music to bolster its space opera – up to and including full-band songs with lyrics and lore, so many of which now exist that this year’s TennoCon featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKai40IaURo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nearly-stadium-sized concert</a> with multiple vocalists and a pyrotechnics show (Ford played bass in the band). <em>The Old Peace</em> leans into this particular penchant, albeit in a more somber way than <em>1999</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"The song sung by the Sentients to one another as they crossed the deep gulf of space [to Tau], it's got that kind of pioneering vibe to it, but it's also got a fatalistic vibe,” said Bott. “There's a direct inspirational link between 'There is some corner of foreign field that is forever England' and 'Who but we shall distant die on that far shore forlorn.' It's that same sense of 'We know that we are fated to eventually perish on some literally alien landscape,' but that is our nature, that is our destiny.'”</p><p>"'We've been made to die,'" added Kingsley.</p><p>It’s a stark tonal shift away from <em>Warframe</em>’s previous expansion, but the developers at Digital Extremes are confident in their ability to navigate it.</p><p>"<em>Warframe</em> tries to never repeat itself beat for beat, and because <em>1999 </em>was more tongue-in-cheek and was goofier and more humorous, this is more of a return to form," said Kingsley.</p><p>"I think [giving people something like <em>1999</em>] would have been an easy thing to do, but that's why we didn't do it,” said Bott. “The intent is to deliver something that is, palette wise, completely different than what we just did, and that is something we have done again and again.”</p><figure><figcaption>Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure><p>If nothing else, it’s relevant subject matter, considering the ever-worsening state of the world. But as far as Ford is concerned, that’s always been the case.</p><p>"My mom is a very eccentric woman, and she sent me a text about two months ago. She was born in the 50s, and she said 'Ever since I've been born until the day I die, the world has been at war,’” Ford said. “She's only known war her whole life despite living in the most peaceful times, and there's never been more peace. But you can't really say that with the world we have where everything is so accessible, especially stories of what's going on with conflict and war."</p><p>"The inspiration for taking a slice of time where a treaty should have happened and what's going on, it of course is coming from anything the globe can put in front of us.” she added. “We can look at it and we can say, 'How can we make this human story about space kids that control robots be rooted in the truth of all war?'"</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update: 🤔]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During TennoCon 2025 (the tenth edition of the community event), Digital Extremes announced what's coming next to Warframe, its popular free-to-play third-person online action game.</p>



<p>Later this year, Warframe will be updated with a new Narrative Chapter titled 'The Old Peace'. It will usher players into the past, where they will relive the long-forgotten tale of Tau and his childhood friend, Adis, and the war between the Orokin and their creations, the Dax Anarch Warriors (a new enemy faction), on the Perita moon. This quest will be operator-focused, in case you were wondering. The Old Peace continues Warframe's current “Void War” story arc and sets the stage for the monumental Tau Narrative Chapter, coming at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>Alongside The Old Peace, the developers will also add a new side story titled 'The Devil's Triad'. In this narrative, players will welcome a new trio of characters: Father Lyon Allard (Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (Protoframe of Wisp), and Uriel (the new devil-themed Warframe).</p>



<p>Digital Extremes also unveiled the Operator's graphically remastered character models and cosmetic assets to improve visual fidelity, including new facial animations, and align with Warframe’s latest assets. Last but not least, a new Ultimate ability will be introduced for the Operator. More details about this will be revealed later.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developers then moved on to the untitled Fall update that will debut in a few months. This patch will continue improving the new player experience in Warframe, with a new Mod tutorial Quest, The Teacher, developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital. The 62nd Warframe, a long-awaited Oberon rework, a fresh Lavos deluxe skin, among other quality-of-life improvements, are scheduled to be released with this update, too. More details will be provided in the September live stream.</p>



<p>The Android closed beta for Warframe will also arrive this Fall. Sign-ups for the closed beta playtest <a href="http://warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are available now</a>. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> scares me a bit. Ok, it scares me a lot. Here's this big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> MMO that's been growing for over a decade, adding layers upon layers of complex sci-fi lore and context to its imposing metal form.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell you before googling it why one of my fellow article writers had declared in the chat for a recent press preview that Excalibur Prime users won't be spared when the revolution comes. I can tell you that its end of year 2025 update is called The Old Peace, and looks like it'll be a hoot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Old Peace, which developers Digital Extremes have just shown off a demo of at this year's edition of annual Warframe get-together TennCon, is all about "the war-scarring conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors" upon the Perita moon". The demo of it kicked off with the player fighting a huge robo-lad that turned out to be manned by a small robo-lady, who then accompanies you through events you're hallucinating via a Matrix-esque tech bath with <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Lotus">The Lotus</a>, the mysterious figure who talks you through missions from the start of the game.</p>
<p>"You had the new war, you know about the old war," Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford said of the update, "but now it's time to learn about the old peace, where, as with all wars, there was a moment in time when there was an effort for peace, a treaty. There was a time on Tau when things could have been different."</p>

<p>The Old Peace, which'll expand Warframe's focus skill tree and add in a new baddie faction, is bringing with it a standalone side story called The Devil's Triad that looks like it'll see you take on three scary bosses to earn a new warframe and a couple of new protoframes. The frame's dubbed Uriel, it's devil themed, and it's also the last warframe that the game's former art director Michael 'Mynki' Brennan worked on prior to his death from cancer in <a href="https://www.vg247.com/remembering-michael-mynki-brennans-warframe">October last year</a>.</p>
<p>Before all of that, the game'll also be getting an autumn update featuring a Lavos Deluxe cosmetic, a rework of the Oberon frame, and a quest called The Teacher. The latter's designed to teach you all about modding in Warframe, which sadly is of the adding stuff to gear in a game variety, rather than the downloading a thing that turns NPCs into Shrek variety.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Digital Extremes also announced that a standalone Warframe TTRPG module, made in collaboration with sci-fi dice game Starfinder devs Paizo and dubbed Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias, is launching in October this year.</p>
<p>Going back to The Old Peace, the very end of its TennoCon showing teases Warframe's future, with an update dubbed Tau coming in 2026 set to continue the game's current "Void War" story arc. "We have a very ambitious next couple of years [planned], to get the roots of Warframe and everything we're gonna need [in place] to continue this crazy journey," Ford said.</p>
<p>So, no slowing down in sight for the massive MMO's continued metamorphosis, even as Digital Extremes' other project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>, inches closer to full release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warframes-2025-end-of-year-update-is-all-about-the-old-peace-as-hallucinated-via-communal-matrix-bath]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> is getting The Devil's Triade update this fall, adding two the devil frame Uriel, a new quest, and two new protoframes. Yes, you can romance them.
</p>
<p>The update is a side story that's coming alongside the next major update: The Old Peace. The protoframes you'll be meeting are Harrow and Wisp, a sign that new protoframes will still be coming even as the game leaves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">the Warframe 1999 setting</a>.
</p>
<p>Uriel, the devil-themed warframe coming alongside The Devil's Triade, was confirmed by Soulframe's creative director Geoff Crookes in a pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A as the last design by Michael “Mynki” James Brennan, who passed away last year.

<p>In that same pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A, Warframe community manager Megan Everett confirmed that those who choose to romance these new Protoframes as part of The Devil's Triade side story will not have to worry about pre-existing relationships in the Warframe 1999 setting. The reason being that Warframe 1999 is The Drifter's story, whereas this upcoming update focuses on The Operator.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of reveals of Tennocon this year. Earlier today, Soulframe got a new trailer and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026">opened the floodgates for anyone who signs up</a>. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> fans won't need to be reminded it's a big weekend for developer Digital Extremes and its long-running sci-fi shooter. Thanks to this year's TennoCon live event, which is traditionally the time for the studio to dazzle its community with all sorts of things to come, we've now got a pretty good idea of what Warframe's next twelve months look like.
</p>
<p>
Top of the list for this year's big updates is The Old Peace, Warframe's next major quest and narrative chapter. It's basically the prelude to next year's big Tau update (which we'll get to in a bit) and comes packaged with a new side story called The Devil's Triad.
</p>
<p>
Focusing on The Old Peace's quest bit first, it whisks players back to the Tau of the past, where - to paraphrase the official description - they'll ecnounter a childhood Sentient friend named Adis, and experience the conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors upon the Perita moon. And as for that Devil's Triad side story, it'll serve as the introduction to three new characters: Father Lyon Allard (the Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (the Protoframe of Wisp), and new devil-themed Warframe Uriel.
</p>

<figcaption>Warframe - The Old Peace trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfoypaVNGuU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Alongside all <em>that</em>, you've got a new enemy faction, a Focus expansion introducing a new Operator ability, and - on that subject - a full graphical remaster for Warframe's Operators, which includes new character models and cosmetic assets, new facial animations, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for The Old Peace yet besides its vague "2025" window, but you can at least keep your Tenno spirits up in the immediate terms with the tuneful Lullaby of the Manifold, which is leaping out of Digital Extremes' Old Peace reveal trailer and onto "most" major music streaming platforms on 21st July. Valkyrie gets some new premium in-game cosmetic options when her Heirloom Collection arrives on the same day, and - as summer departs in its annual seasonal strop - there's still more to come. 
</p>
<p>
In October, Digital Extremes is teaming up with tabletop RPG creator Paizo to bring Warframe to tabletops in both physical and digital forms, while other autumnal treats include the launch of Warframe's closed beta on Android (you can <a href="http://warframe.com/android">sign up for that here</a>), and another big update currently known only as "untitled". It might not have a name yet, but it'll still be one to watch, and it's introducing a very much-requested - and much-needed - tutorial quest teaching players how to use Warframe's complicated upgrade system, Mods. Digital Extremes has sought outside help for this one, and the resulting quest, appropriately known as The Teacher, has been developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital.

<p>
On top of all that, "untitled" brings an  Oberon rework, a new Lavos deluxe skin, plus various quality-of-life improvements, which you can learn more about in a livestream this September. And one more thing to add under 'relatively imminent': Caliban Prime Access arrives "soon".
</p>
<p>
And finally for your Warframe calendars, should that be a thing you own, there's the aforementioned Tau. It's described as a "monumental" new narrative chapter that follows on from the events of this year's The Old Peace, and it's launching in 2026. And if Digital Extremes' wish comes true, Warframe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-studio-would-love-to-do-a-proper-switch-2-version-but-its-still-waiting-on-a-dev-kit-so-if-you-know-anyone">might even be available on Switch 2</a> by then.

            <p>EA is planning a three-day event that will finally include the reveal of the next Battlefield game. Rumour has it, it's called - yup, you've guessed it - Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>According to Battlefield content creator Rivalxfactor, via a combination of informants and a <a href="https://i.ibb.co/mVCZqL74/battlefield-6.jpg">now-deleted tweet</a> from a content creator who received a "massive" Battlefield 6 case in the mail, they believe a reveal is imminent, with Rivalxfactor stating they have it confirmed that "there is indeed a three-day RA event starting on 29th July".</p>

<p>"This is where Battlefield 6 will be revealed, devs will be interviewed in a somewhat fixed format, and the game will be featured with content creators," Rivalxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946401115240644819">wrote</a>. "The open beta will launch shortly after.</p>
<p>"It will be much like the BF1 event with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased," they <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395">added</a> on a different tweet.</p>
<p>As for the picture of the promotional case that's seemingly gone out to content creators? We can't presume it's real, of course - so take it all with the requisite dollop of salt - but the image shows a case with 'Battlefield 6' emblazoned across the front, its straps seemingly branded with different Battlefield modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, PTFO, and Rush.</p> <div>

<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>. EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.</p>
<p>Although the closed Battlefield playtest is described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requires participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage has popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy Reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking, but stuff continues to leak, including clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a> mode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">its single-player campaign</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">18 minutes of Rush mode</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-called-battlefield-6-and-the-reveal-event-is-coming-very-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Outlast Trials Season 4, Project Diarchy, is now available, ushering in 2 new MK-Challenges, a reworked Rebirth system, new cosmetics, and an all-new Shopping Mall map in which new prime assets Otto and Arora Kress will terrorise you. Lovely.</p>
<p>Conjoined at birth, the Kress Twins "have a set of eyes both fore and aft". Able to spot a victim from any angle, you'll either have to stop them with a thrown vile of noxious poison, or "split them in two with their buzzsaw". Double lovely.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new trial - Kill the Politician - and the complementary MK Challenge, which sees you guarding them "door to door". There's also Sentence The Prosecuted in which you'll have to decipher the charges, pin them to the defendant, and "make sure that it sticks". Which probably means exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>As for the Rebirth rework?</p>
<p>"After careful consideration, Easterman is reopening the Rebirth to all reagents who deserve it," Red Barrels writes. "Rebirth now offers two options: The original Rebirth for solo players. The new Rebirth, called Communal Rebirth, which is designed for teams."</p>
<p>Communal Rebirth drops the players in a random Trial with 3 unique variators - Mirror, Rebirth, and Classified. Rebirth now requires each member of a group to have 100 Rebirth Tokens. It is now possible to stack up to 1000 Rebirth Tokens, which is just as well, because Rebirth Token rewards for completing Trials have also been revisited, and you'll now get 5 Rebirth Tokens per Trial, and 3 Rebirth Tokens per MK-Challenge.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a> launched back in 2013, casting players as journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated the notorious Mount Massive Asylum. Its terrifying (and often quite grim) blend of first-person night-vision exploration and frantic chase thrills quickly attracted fans, leading to a story expansion the following year and a full-blown sequel in 2017.</p>
<p>This second outing - which saw players investigating a murder in the Arizona desert - ramped up the violence and strenuous pursuit sequences to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-2-review">slightly less positive reception</a>, but it still did well enough that Red Barrels was able to launch a third game, co-operative multplayer survival horror <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>, into early access in 2023.</p>
<p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-horror-series-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">Lionsgate recently announced it's working on a film version of developer Red Barrels' survival horror series, Outlast</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-season-4-is-here-heres-whats-new]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soulframe-preludes-opens-up-to-public-access-for-everyone-who-signs-up-by-july-20.1248021/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes has revealed major <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulframe</a> news at TennoCon 2025. Preludes, the Pre-Alpha version of the game, will be opened to public access for everyone who signs up <a href="http://www.soulframe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> by July 20 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time. They'll continue to have access until the game's full public launch. After the open sign-up period ends, players can still sign up but will be placed in a queue until additional access becomes available.</p>



<p>Geoff Crookes, Creative Director of Soulframe, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Over a year now of players going hands-on with Soulframe in our Preludes pre-alpha builds, we’ve learned so many lessons and built a lot of new features for us as a studio. After last TennoCon, we put a huge amount of effort into improving combat fluidity and continued that passionate work into exploring brand new features like player social hubs, asynchronous player messaging with World Trees, among so many other additions. Today, we shared what the latest additions to our next Preludes build would be and beyond. We promise to all existing and future players to keep trying new things outside our comfort zone and work with you to create something we’ve all been looking for.</em></p>



<p>Combat has been significantly improved since last year, with smoother and more grounded fights. Movement and stagger have been overhauled, and a new "Smite" critical hit that allows "soul stealing" from enemies has been implemented. Bows have been reworked as well, and a new "Combat Arts" system, where packs and weapons level up through combat to unlock unique arts, is being introduced. More weapons will be added, including a two-handed axe.</p>



<p>The gameplay demo from TennoCon 2025 also showed new content and features coming to Soulframe.  A new fable, "The She-Wolf Snared," which is Orgal's fable, has been added. Playing it allows players to get their own puppy. New time-based festivals, including the "Festival of the Circade" and "Akfolmar" (a spooky season event), have been introduced. Improvements have been made to the Sparrow's Tale system, an in-game mission system now tied to factions, offering greater variety in mission types. The new player experience has been improved, too, with the game now starting with a choice to pick an alignment (Spirit, Courage, or Grace), which is connected to one of three enclaves in their faction system (Alchemist's Children, Kith and Kin, and Silent Rose).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players will soon find a new enemy, the Wazzard of Wastes, who is the source of the rot in the heart of the Galvinar Swam. Furthermore, this magical mini-boss offered a new perspective on Magick-focused combat in Soulframe, showing off a new parry feature that can reflect projectiles back at the corrupt thaumaturge. After an initial tease, TennoCon 2025 attendees and viewers were even treated to the next Omen Beast boss fight: Bromius. Players will explore the underground realm of the Neath’uns, which is full of corrupted Sproutfolk and environmental puzzles that hinder the rehabilitation of the mutated, three-headed Bromius from the sinister whispers within the dark, tainted sap.</p>



<p>The Soulframe development team then showcased the first set of hairstyles available for players to customize their Envoy. Eight different hairstyle cosmetics are in production, and additional customizations for Envoys are still to come. More interestingly, the Soulframe team presented a customizable approach to combat techniques and skill progression that can be tailored to individual playstyle preferences. Offensive and defensive build options can be mixed and matched, including close-range melee focused on creating space with dodges and ranged damage that can close the gap with timed parries. Other combinations include more supportive roles. This progression approach allows players to tailor their Envoy's strengths to their preferred playstyle. It also adds to situational party compositions when playing cooperatively with others across various encounters.</p>

            <p>Fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a> remains nestled away in its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-warframe-devs-want-you-to-come-try-their-luxurious-fantasy-action-rpg-soulframe">closed alpha form</a> as this year’s TennoCon arrives. Despite plans to open that beta’s doors to a bunch more folks over the course of this weekend, developers Digital Extremes are keen to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>'s cottagecore sibling closed off for at least a bit longer.</p>
<p>The good news is that they have a bunch of new stuff they’re planning to unleash into fantasy land soon, as they continue to build a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe">strong fairytale-infused foundation</a> for the tale of the natural world clashing with technologically-advanced invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, if you've signed up for an account via <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/signup">Soulframe’s website</a> to this point or do during the course of this weekend, July 19th to 20th, you’ll be granted access to Soulframe’s Preludes alpha testing, joining the fair few folks already running around in there. Given that’s likely to drive a pretty sizeable expansion of the playerbase, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair was asked during a press preview attended by RPS whether it indicates an early access release might be coming soon.</p>
<p>“We have ambitions, we have a few things…about our progression systems that are not quite in yet. We’re not comfortable doing anything open until those systems are in,” he replied, “So, it’s a great opportunity to join us and help shape that future, but we still have a few things we need to get in before we’re comfortable even trying that.”</p>
<p>While they’re still playing a bit coy with regards to timings on Soulframe additions, the devs did show off a number of features that’ll be arriving in the game soon, with the biggest being a new quest in the form of the Waste Bear fable. This got a big demo playthrough as part of the game’s Tennocon 2025 showcase, and it’s all about you being enlisted by a witch who is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur</a> levels of French to investigate the plight of a three-headed bear omen spirit called Bromius, who's struggling to fulfil his duty of caring for the trees.</p>

<p>There’s outside pollution that’s affecting him, some little woodland fellas called Sproutfolk that you’ll have to battle to save them from the corruption, and a boss battle you’ll have to trek through a new dungeon called the Neath’uns to face. If you want to know more about how it came to be and why it features a mini-boss who is brilliantly named the Wazzard of Wastes, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-director-chats-wiz-versus-waz-and-a-demo-he-hopes-will-help-prove-its-not-just-a-soulslike">our pre-TennoCon interview with Soulframe director Geoff Crookes</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the devs also teased the mote system that’ll allow you to unleash weird little woodland creatures on your opponents, expanded character customisation via the means to change your hairstyle, and some medieval-style martial arts manuals being added into the progression system to teach you skills like parrying. Plus, the promise of more stuff to do down the line in the form of extra Sparrow’s Tales, fables, and ancestor ghost people to recruit to your home camp, the Nightfold.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty cool, though that might just be me being easily swayed by the fact the bear fable involves you fighting a Wazzard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframes-getting-a-bear-quest-and-its-devs-want-you-to-keep-bearing-with-them-as-you-wait-for-it-to-emerge-from-alpha]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Soulframe is a free-to-play, open-world multiplayer RPG with a fantasy setting that sits in contrast to Warframe's sci-fi world. It’s much more rooted in a connection to nature, encouraging exploration of Midrath’s mystical wilderness. Instead of guns and lasers, think bows and magic.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're interested in trying the game for yourself, you can sign up right now on the Soulframe <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2QQfvF1_72cTWjozBDJbSrvJV_Nt-eZQ3-D_SvKgyLAS1b0gjmAFILXJPex6kUuka-j-ml9wMeC1paZGCHTEXX6NqVnpvHSwUtapNkrV9WkY7_Pa-XKCIlEUmps0Q_MJBe1ZqUVT08dSr3jVssyBRX5IJwR-aG3IDv4RLMZUGy2RpUEo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a>. Digital Extremes is granting Soulframe Preludes access to all players who sign up during TennoCon weekend, <strong>before July 20 at 11:59 p.m. ET</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Earlier, Steve spoke about how skill trees felt "boring," and maybe not the right fit for Soulframe as a live service game, while showing off concept art of a new skill system. Can you speak a bit more about the new way of managing and obtaining skills, and how it works better for Soulframe? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scott McGregor</strong>: If you're familiar with the early days of Warframe, we had a version of a skill tree. And we found it didn't work. And then, we repeated the same problem again [laughs]. And in Soulframe, we were attempting to try to tie it to… a broader category of weapons to sort of make that pace work with the length of the game that we're making. The games that we make, obviously, are thousands of hours. You know, we're getting players, hopefully, in for a long time, right? We have lots of players that have been with us on Warframe for the full 12 years.</p><p dir="ltr">And designing systems that can be interesting and deep enough for that amount of time is a challenge. So, obviously, seeing where we were on the skill trees, we felt, again, it wasn't going to work for us. So we're pivoting to a system that's more open-ended, and more something that you can add to quickly, and out of sync. Skill trees sort of suffer from this problem [where] you have to respect all the player's investment in it.</p><p dir="ltr">So, a player that has been with us for a very long time… if you add something cool and new to the game, they can get the thing that's at the very end of the tree, right? A new player that, you know, joined five years in, cannot. Or someone that just, you know, happened to watch a dev stream is like, "Oh, those new skills that you're adding to the game look really cool. I want to check out this game." And then they look at the skill tree and go, "Oh my God, this is thousands of hours just to get to the end where I can get this final new skill."</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas an open-ended system, where you can add things and take away as we develop them, allows new and old players to experience those things. So I think that is one of the reasons why we're doing this. It's like making a system that can grow with us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534957-bromius-fight-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534957" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534957-bromius-fight-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534957"></a><figcaption>The Envoy fighting a troubled Bromius.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534957-bromius-fight-6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: It's not 100% [one way or the other]. [Your] progression of the amount [of skills] that you can slot will be tied to the progression of the weapon category. So if you're using bows, you'll have like a bow skill ninja scroll type thing that you can slot in--different bow techniques and bow skills. And then, as you get better with more bows, you [will] have more slots to slot [skills] in. And then finding the individual skills will be based on what's in the world. Like you can find it from an ancestor, or pick up a rare one from a drop, or something like that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>We met this French-speaking witch, Verminia--who I love by the way, because I speak French--and it was mentioned that language is important in Soulframe. Does language diversity tie into the narrative, or is it more of an overall vibe or feeling you were going for when expanding or fleshing out the world?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sydney Hills</strong>: Yeah, definitely a big part of the soul of Soulframe is the different languages and the different accents. We've worked with voice actors from tons of different places already. Kim Bonifay, who voices Verminia--she's French, [but] I think she's located in London, England. Also, for the Bromius quest, we got Øystein Kanestrøm, who is the voice of Bromius. And he is Finnish, recording from Finland.</p><p dir="ltr">I know in my writing, I source a lot of inspiration from historical languages and historical slang. For our last update, we got a bunch of Scottish voice actors in for all of these NPCs around Dendria, which is our pseudo-Scottish town. And I learned so much good Scottish slang and it was so much fun [to learn]. A lot of the time, I would come into the recording sessions with some Scottish slang in the script, and the Scottish actors would be like, "So does this mean he's drunk?" And I would be like, "Well, no, I thought that meant he was tired." They're like, "Nope, this means drunk." Every Scottish slang [term] means drunk if you really get to the bottom of it [laughs].</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534955-bromius-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534955" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534955-bromius-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534955"></a><figcaption>Bromius looking at an acorn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534955-bromius-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Anyways, tangent, but definitely in the Bromius quest too, we had a lot of influence from Finnish mythology [and] Finnish language. There's this word… a Finnish word, [and] it kind of means "tears of the deep forest spruce." And again, it's alcohol. It's another euphemism for moonshine.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: Oh, really?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Doing that sort of early language [research] definitely helps inspire a lot of the themes. It definitely helped inspire the Bromius quest. And, you know, what would a tree cry? It would be sap.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are some of the challenges you face when crafting a narrative for a live service game in these early stages, while players are still playing Preludes, and it's not, you know, fully open yet? How far ahead do you have to look and plan for a game that wants to grow year after year?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Narrative-wise, it's definitely a lot of guessing. There's a lot. There's some things that we know for sure. We have really big plot points surrounding some of our big villains and our big heroes, and people that we'll need to save. But a lot of it… comes up organically in writing weapon descriptions or location text in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a lot of, you know, very slow building, and every once in a while I'll insert another, "Okay, there's another place in this world called 'Skelflind.' And now that's a thing, and we can draw on it later. It's a lot of following threads of what we find interesting and hoping that they'll all fit together in the end.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That sounds really difficult, I'm not gonna lie [laughs].</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: There's a lot of planting seeds. You're leaving little nuggets of stuff that you're going to come back [to] years later and be like, "Oh, well, this is what I meant back then about that thing that I only mentioned in one sentence." But we expand that later. I always found that was super interesting about the Warframe development. Stuff that was, you know, vaguely referenced in very early lore, becomes this great big thing later on. And I think that was fantastic. And I think Soulframe will follow that same path.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534956-wavetwood-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534956" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534956-wavetwood-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534956"></a><figcaption>The Envoy exploring the woods.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534956-wavetwood-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: It's a different category. So, sidearms are our subsection of weapons that can only fit into that slot. I won't say that we won't allow you eventually to mix and match and put a sidearm into your main [slot] or your main into your sidearm [slot]. That could end up being a thing, but currently, right now, we have them in two [different] buckets.</p><p dir="ltr">But there will be different options in your sidearm. So you'll be able to get a magic casting wrist gauntlet for your sidearm. Or you'll be able to get a wrist-mounted bow. It isn't always just gonna be blades or maces, or stuff like that. There'll be a variety of weapons in both categories.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think community manager Sarah [Asselin] was talking about it, and she said that the sidearm is very distinctly not [a] secondary weapon.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: Yeah… I think Steve [Sinclair] is rubbing off on Sydney, too. They like to name things--give them names for Soulframe. Which, you know, makes my life difficult because I always stumble on these things when we're trying to talk about them in public. Because it's like, "It's your sidearm," [but no,] "It's your secondary."</p><p dir="ltr">I think that's what's great about the games that we do make is [that] we go that little bit extra to make sure that they have a flavor and a uniqueness. It isn't just the same thing that everyone uses. We try to make sure we put something on it that makes it unique to our game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534948-wazzard-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534948-wazzard-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534948"></a><figcaption>The new Wazzard of Wastes enemy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534948-wazzard-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: For me, currently the coolest one I think we've got was the alt fire for the bows. 'Cause [it's] like a rain of [arrows] in an area of effect. I thought that was a nice play on something that's sort of... there's bows in a lot of games, and there's a lot of ways to do it. And I thought that felt really unique to us.</p><p dir="ltr">The mechanic that we've been really buzzing about in the demo is--if you saw it in the live demo--was the [ability to] reflect magic back and forth. It was like a wizard on wizard battle. So, you can actually ping-pong that projectile back and forth, like a parry, right? With swords, that's how it works. If you're timing it right, you can actually bounce that back and forth. And every time that projectile goes back and forth, it gets a little bit more powerful. So, landing that shot could feel very amazing if you are the one sending it. That was one that's been super popular in the studio, that feels really awesome.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Magic ping-pong. Has anyone called it that yet?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: I don't know [laughs]. I'm waiting for you guys to name it so I can stumble over it later.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Magic ping-pong. Write that down [laughs].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: And then, future things. For me, it's Motes. We have a Mote system in the game--it's just kind of bland. It's just stats. And we've come up with this [new] idea that the Motes are creatures that live in your sword and give your sword unique abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">As that system progresses and starts to come together, and we add to it and change it, it's starting to really feel unique to the game. So, I'm excited about where that's heading as a future thing I'm working on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534949-motes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534949-motes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534949"></a><figcaption>The Motes menu, where you choose upgrades and buffs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534949-motes.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Soulframe is built on a story tied to nature. And we can see that in environments and characters like the bear, Bromius, in the demo. Was there any emphasis being put on adding more talking or singing animal encounters or companions? Because I'm imagining a Disney princess vibe, but just more dangerous.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Yeah, the current lore is it's just our Omen Beasts who can speak. All of the other animals in-game, currently, are just cute little chittering noises. Though we were talking [about]--[and] someone made a joke today about [it having] a Pied Piper vibe--a bunch of little singing and dancing animals following behind a bard. And I thought that would be really cute if they sang.</p><p dir="ltr">But no, I think for now, our Omen Beasts… embody almost the collective spirit of the animal species that they stand for. So Bromius is the collective spirit of all of the bears in Midrath. And so, because of that, he has this extra source of power that allows him to communicate with the Envoy. And I'm sure we'll keep building on that with new Omen Beasts in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any stories or tales you take inspiration from when crafting the narrative that people might not expect?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Since working on Soulframe, I've gotten super into historical mythologies. And when we first started talking about doing a bear Omen Beast, I definitely did my little research to see what kind of cultures have bears in their myths. And there's a lot of them. We ended up going with the Finnish inspiration because Finland <em>really </em>is passionate about their bears.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, [bears] persist in the mythology [of several cultures]. Back [in] BC--like prehistoric or early historic, ancient antiquity era, they have… I wrote it down… Otso! [He] is this mythological bear that's a part of this really, really awesome poetry epic from Finland that is kind of a creation myth. And it has the bear as the king of the forest. And he's kind of equally feared and respected, which I thought is an interesting thing to think about with Bromius.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll see more of him in the rest of the demo, but he's more than a big, scary guy. He's got a really sweet and soft side that I'm really excited about.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I mean, he </strong><em><strong>was </strong></em><strong>singing to a plant. </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: [laughs] Yeah! You've seen it. It's there.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yeah, I can't wait to see the rest of the demo.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is still in pre-alpha. The game is set to launch for PC later this year.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li>The sun went away long enough for <strong>TSBonyman</strong> to play more Tainted Grail and to make a start on Dead Island 2, or more accurately, a re-start, picking up from his trial save file.</li>
<li>Dead Island 2 was also on <strong>Andrewww’s</strong> playlist, as he checked it out before it left PS Plus. He found it a little disappointing though, so moved along to The Stanley Parable, which he enjoyed somewhat, and watched his daughter playing Astro Bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend and we’ll see you for more gaming gubbins on Monday.</p>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>
<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026. It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>"Krafton's decisions were made to ensure Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players - who are at the heart of everything Krafton does - and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands," a Krafton spokesperson told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/krafton-responds-to-subnautica-founders-lawsuit-we-look-forward-to-defending-ourselves-in-court/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica’s fans."</p>
<p>All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> last weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would "minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft's own shareholders have directly challenged the publisher to respond to the huge swell of support behind Stop Killing Games – a consumer movement generated by Ubisoft's decision to take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">The Crew offline last year</a>.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions.</p>

<p>The games preservation movement was motivated by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.</p>
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said, as noted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a> (paywalled) and spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/ubisoft-ceo-addresses-stop-killing-games-after-overseeing-the-deaths-of-the-crew-and-xdefiant-support-for-all-games-cannot-last-forever/">GamesRadar+</a>. "And, whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7."</p>
<p>Guillemot suggests the publisher already provides "information regarding the game and how long the game can be played", and pointed out it also adds an "online connection required" warning to the front of its boxed products as well as explain that the company can "cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice" in the fine print.</p>
<p>Guillemot also told shareholders it offered "a one-Euro fee proposed to all buyers of the game. For just one Euro they got to buy the next version." As Game File points out, this appears to be in reference to a sale last year that briefly sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> for $1/€1.</p>
<p>"This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft," Guillemot added. "All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever."</p>
<p>"The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there's a service component, eventually services may be discontinued, because eventually the software may become obsolete over time," Guillemot concluded. "A lot of tools become obsolete 10 or 15 years down the line. They're no longer available. And that is why we release a new version. And so we have version two and then version three. But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."</p>
<p>Gulliemot's response, however, feels a tad simplistic, as never-ending access to a game isn't what the Stop Killing Games movement is actually asking for.</p>
<p>"We are in favor of publishers ending support for a game whenever they choose," the FAQs <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">explain</a>. "What we are asking for is that they implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary. We agree that it is unrealistic to expect companies to support games indefinitely and do not advocate for that in any way. Additionally, there are already real-world examples of publishers ending support for online-only games in a responsible way, such as: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-sport">Gran Turismo Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a>."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> is demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated, and it's already surpassed 1m signatures. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - weighed in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement]]></content:encoded>

<hr>
<p>My first gaming memory: waking up in the middle of the night, heading downstairs, and booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_superstar_baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a>'s campaign mode on my GameCube.</p>
<p>It was completely out of character, according to my parents, who still tell the story of my midnight gambit to this day. I had never dared transgress the norms of bedtime before, but my love for Mario and his cadre of ball-playing desperados drew me there – in front of the television in the wee hours of the morning, having the time of my life playing my favourite game. I was six. It was 2005.</p>
<p>Mario Superstar Baseball is reviewed as a completely mediocre game across the board. An ancillary Nintendo sports title developed primarily by Namco and released in the fog of the GameCube's dying breath. Yet it deserves its moment in the spotlight for its ability to show sports kids what makes Mario fun, in a gentle and approachable way. It made video games accessible to those of us in the mid-2000s whose inner nerds waited patiently just beneath the surface. For that reason, Mario Superstar Baseball is more than a nostalgia trip. It's a connector that encourages players old and new to come out of their shells (blue, red, green, or otherwise) and explore the colourful world of games.</p>

<p>When you isolate its core mechanics, Mario Superstar Baseball is pretty close to a rhythm game. Fielding is mostly automated, outside of a few button presses and the option to control players as they race to get underneath pop flies. Thus, the overwhelming majority of gameplay is spent performing baseball’s two other essential functions: pitching and batting.</p>
<p>To pitch, you aim over the plate with the sticks before holding and releasing the 'A' button on time with your character’s specific pitch motion. Part of the game’s nuance is perfecting the timing of these motions across different characters while learning the little tricks that come along with tossing change-ups, curveballs, and special pitches that make use of your character’s “Star Power.” Pro tip: Even though Kamek doesn’t come to mind off the bat as a dominant athlete among the roster of Mario characters included, this Magikoopa’s change-ups rank among the most brutal salvos the game has to offer. Have a go – you’ll be impossible to hit in no time.</p>

<p>Batting, on the other hand, is all about subtle choices. Beginners will charge up their swings by holding 'A' before each pitch, but doing so can throw off your timing, especially on fast balls. What’s more, a lot of skill-based characters, like Daisy and Luigi, are optimised around getting on base with a single button tap at the right time rather than hitting home runs with a supercharged cut at the ball.</p>
<p>Therefore, mastering the art of the bat also requires getting to know each character in your lineup. Knowing how to react when it's Shy Guy’s turn in the order versus a power hitter like Bowser or Donkey Kong constitutes a large part of Mario Superstar Baseball’s catalytic joy. Each character’s play style matches their personality and special traits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> titles might get all the hype these days, especially in this new era of the Switch 2, Mario Superstar Baseball should not be forgotten, as it is a key example of what Nintendo wants to do with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-sports-games-of-all-time">Mario Sports</a> titles. That is, to provide a whimsical on-ramp for new fans to access the joys of the franchise while staying true enough to its roots to delight even those disciples that have enjoyed Mario since the Jump Man days. If you’re ever looking for more blasts from the past in this same vein, have a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a> for the DS (<strong>Mario Slam Basketball</strong> in Europe). Oddly enough, it was developed in collaboration with Square Enix and thus features characters from the Mushroom Kingdom competing against mainstays from the Final Fantasy franchise. A true handheld treat!</p>

<p>Speaking of handhelds, now that the Switch 2 has hit store shelves, Nintendo has managed to reclaim the video game industry spotlight. Every time they release a new console, I can’t help but think back to my favorite hardware from the Nintendo canon – and that frosty night back in 2005, just before New Year’s, when I crawled out of bed and braved the pitch darkness so that I could play a few more delightful innings with Mario and friends.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo and the gaming world at large appear to have all but moved on from Mario Superstar Baseball — especially since the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Super Sluggers</a> for the Wii and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_sports_superstars">Mario Sports Superstars</a> for the 3DS — it’s essential to look back at what makes this game and its quirky little cube-shaped console special as we move into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>While I hope Nintendo does continue to innovate, I also enjoy keeping the lamp lit for less heralded titles from its past that have made a difference larger than the sum of their parts, mediocre reviews and all. Mario Superstar Baseball is one such title, and a reboot in this era of gaming could have the potential to bring us all back to a simpler time. A time when twangy harmonica music played us into a pristine cutscene of Mario making an athletic play at his home stadium, finding a flyer from Bowser challenging his crew for the title of best baseball team in town, and questing from ballpark to ballpark all in the name of good fun and weird minigames. With nothing on the line that a secret midnight foray into the family room couldn’t fix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: </strong></em><em>this article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Donkey Kong Bananza. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is now out in the wild, and one of the biggest burning questions ahead of launch centered on DK’s new best friend: Pauline. She’s a teenager in Bananza –  13 years old, to be precise – and this has led to rampant speculation that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey, which features an adult Pauline living in New Donk City. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve played through the main story of Bananza and completed most of its major post-game beats, which means we now have the answers to that question and more. But be warned, we’re about to <strong>spoil the entirety of Donkey Kong Bananza's finale</strong>. So if you’re still working your way to the Planet Core, turn back now, and join us once you’ve seen Bananza through to the end yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/new-donk-1752851646893.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline and DK arrive in New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza eventually reveals that 13-year-old Pauline does, in fact, call New Donk City home, just like her Odyssey counterpart, and the story’s grand finale takes place in the metropolis after it’s been completely overrun by the returning King K. Rool. When DK and Pauline break through to the surface, Pauline exclaims “This is MY city!”, confirming the fan theory that Bananza would end by returning Pauline home to Odyssey’s most iconic location. But is this city connection enough to confirm that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background on Pauline, who is central to this mystery. In Odyssey, Pauline (who’s a full-grown adult) is the Mayor of New Donk City, perhaps most memorable for her performance of Jump Up, Super Star! at the New Donk City Festival. Teenage Pauline and Mayor Pauline share a lot in common: Beyond their shared name, they are both singers and performers, with much of Teenage Pauline’s character arc revolving around gaining enough confidence to perform in front of her hometown. She also sings the Bananza Transformation songs, and Void Kong is obsessed with the power of her voice… at least until King K. Rool boots him out of the story entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Pauline’s age, most expected Bananza would be a prequel to Odyssey, and potentially an origin story for New Donk City itself. It would make sense that DK, acting as Pauline’s hero and best friend, would prompt the people to name the town after her savior once she was safely returned. But in Bananza, New Donk City is already established before DK and Pauline arrive, and during one of Teenage Pauline’s monologues at a Getaway, she references New Donk City’s nickname “The Big Banana”, a Kong-inspired parody of New York’s “The Big Apple.” It’s a nickname we’ve heard before, first uttered in Mario Odyssey by a New Donker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using all that as a starting point, it seems that there’s actually more evidence to suggest that Bananza is a <em>sequel </em>to Odyssey, and that Teenage Pauline is Mayor Pauline’s daughter, and the granddaughter of original Pauline (who we’ll call Arcade Pauline). Let us explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teenage Pauline regularly references her grandmother throughout Bananza, including one time directly in the main story. After the pair run into Diddy and Dixie Kong in the Racing Layer, Pauline says to DK during the dive to the next layer, “I’m glad you got to see your friends again! But if I don’t get home, Grandma will worry.” Teenage Pauline’s Grandma is the only family member she directly mentions in Bananza, so Nintendo clearly wants us to think about who her grandma is.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/cutscene-1752851935120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline says her grandma is at "home", later revealed to be New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most likely answer becomes clear when we consider Donkey Kong’s grandfather: Cranky Kong. It is well-established that Cranky Kong is the original Arcade Donkey Kong that kidnapped Arcade Pauline way back in the day. Bananza reinforces this lore, as Cranky rants about his old rival who wore overalls, clearly referencing Mario… or Jumpman, as our favorite plumber was originally known. Cranky and Wrinkly Kong’s son is Donkey Kong Jr., who - despite what the Super Mario Bros. Movie may have tried to tell you - is not actually our current Donkey Kong. Junior starred in the Donkey Kong Jr. arcade game and made various other playable appearances before being essentially wiped from the face of the earth. The tie-wearing Donkey Kong we know and love – first introduced in Rare’s Donkey Kong Country – is actually Donkey Kong <em>the Third</em>, son of Donkey Kong Jr. and an unknown Kong mother. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we’ve established three generations of DK, which brings us back to Pauline. Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline don’t look like the same person. Arcade Pauline has blonde hair, while the Mayor is a brunette. You could argue this is just a character redesign, but a billboard in Odyssey’s New Donk City shows a blonde version of Pauline. Perhaps that’s just a fun easter egg, but perhaps it’s a clue to canon, and we have to use all the evidence we can. The New Donk City Festival – which sees Mario recreating gameplay from the Arcade Donkey Kong game – is held to “tell the story of our city's beginnings," according to Pauline. This implies that New Donk City was founded after the events of the arcade game, built on the foundation of the girders Jumpman climbed up towards Donkey Kong.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/easter-egg-1752851969004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This image of Pauline in Super Mario Odyssey is a reference to the original Pauline from the Donkey Kong arcade game. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New Donk City is a sprawling metropolis, and it likely took the course of at least a human generation to build it up to such an enormous size. That, combined with the different appearances, leads us to believe that Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline are two different people. Perhaps, dare we say, they are mother and daughter? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose it’s possible that Bananza could still be a prequel, that Mayor and Teenage Pauline are one and the same, and that Arcade Pauline is her grandmother with a missing generational link between them, but it feels cleaner to suggest that there are three generations of Pauline: Arcade, Mayor, and Teenage, just like there are three generations of DK: Arcade/Cranky, Jr., and the main DK of today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We really hope our theory that Teenage Pauline is the granddaughter of Arcade Pauline is true, because it’s absolutely adorable that the grandchildren of two of the oldest Nintendo characters have now teamed up and become best friends in Bananza. It’s very cool to think that Nintendo has found a clever way to redefine one of its oldest character dynamics over 40 years later. Unfortunately, completing the bulk of Bananza’s postgame content – which are called Bananza Rehearsals and leads to Bananza’s true final platforming challenge – doesn’t really shed any more light on this. Pauline returns to the surface to perform a song for her city, but all we see of that is a new piece of art that appears after the credits have rolled. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/1000006378-1752850870617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Completing Bananza's post-game content unlocks this bonus art that... doesn't really tell us anything new. | Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while Bananza’s position as a prequel may make a lot of sense, it ultimately can never be more than a theory. There’s just not enough concrete evidence from Nintendo. This theory does raise some concerning, perhaps even supernatural questions about Mario, though. If he has really interacted with multiple generations of Paulines and Donkey Kongs… does this mean Mario never ages, while those around him do? Or are there multiple generations of Mario? Is Nintendo implying that Mario and Jumpman are two different characters? It’s probably best not to think about it too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most crucially, it’s important to remember that Nintendo historically doesn’t care about lore and continuity across its games. Even The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild – has lore inconsistencies that are ultra-hand-waved away. So it’s quite possible Nintendo doesn’t even have a truly established timeline between the original Donkey Kong, Odyssey, and Bananza, and just loves to keep fans guessing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think is going on in Donkey Kong Bananza? Is Teenage Pauline the daughter of Mayor Pauline and granddaughter of the original Pauline Cranky Kong kidnapped all those years ago, or are we being completely ri-Donk-ulous?
