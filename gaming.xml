            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s eighteenth season launches next week and is bringing a Persona 5 crossover alongside a brand new hero.
</p>
<p>
The trailer for Season 18 ends with a tease of Joker from Atlus' beloved JRPG, who will likely appear as a skin for an existing hero. No further details are known at present, but hopefully more character skins and references will make their way into Blizzard's shooter.
</p>
<p>
The new hero joining this season is Wuyang, a Chinese "aquatic prodigy" who fights with a Xuanwu Staff and various water abilities as a support character.

<p>What could it be..?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Acclaim, which was revived earlier this year after more than two decades of dormancy, is teasing some sort of announcement for next week.</p>
<p>It's tough to know exactly what this entails at this stage, and the only clue within the above tease is a very quick cut to show some sort of digital, demonic face with power symbols surrounding it. We've screenshotted this and included it below for your perusal. Any ideas..?</p>
<p>Within its PR release, Acclaim promises "big things to come" and is supposedly hard at work on its "mission to bring players unforgettable, lasting experiences that will keep them coming back for more".</p>
<p>Sounds intriguing, at least. We're not expecting big name franchises at this early stage of Acclaim's revival, but we'll be sure to keep an eye on the upcoming teaser and let you know how things shake out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developers have lifted the lid on the matchmaking system used in the title following a wrath of criticism from players.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, NetEase confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals does not use the controversial EOMM</a> matchmaking system and promised to explain how matchmaking works in a future video.</p>



<p>That video has now been shared, detailing the process of matchmaking and explaining why larger party groups of four-to-six players have been banned in higher ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-matchmaking-explained">Marvel Rivals Matchmaking, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of detail. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the video <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1958627668536311945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), it was explained that several factors are taken into account when queuing for matches, including team composition and your competitive score—the latter calculated by Base Points and Performance Points.</p>



<p>Base Points depend on the outcome of the match, your current competitive score, and the average competitive score of the enemy team. Performance Points, meanwhile, reflect how well you perform in the match, but this doesn’t just tally up stats from the game due to the variety of characters.</p>



<p>The longer you wait for a match, the broader the search will become. When fighting in a part, you’ll only fight against similar-sized parties.</p>



<p>Questions have been asked on why Rivals has not introduced role-based matchmaking to the game, and the answer is that it would result in longer queue times. Similarly, that’s why four-player and six-player teams at higher ranks have also been restricted in a recent update.</p>



<p>Check out the full video below.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> studio Team Cherry already has plans for DLC, with extra content planned in the months and years to come.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">release date was announced for the sequel</a> after seven years in development. Co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen spoke to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> about creating Silksong, and what's coming next.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," said Pellen. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."

<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," added Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p>
<p>
Despite its lengthy development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Silksong hasn't been in development hell</a>. Instead, hype for the sequel snowballed, resulting in sales of the original game skyrocketing. In turn, this provided the financial freedom for Team Cherry to take its time.
</p>
<p>
Hollow Knight Silksong will be released on 4th September, across PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass).

<p>The latest set coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket has leaked ahead of an official reveal, showing that the legendary beasts of Johto will be the main focus.</p>



<p>Leaks for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new set have been rather consistent and accurate, detailing what players can expect ahead of time before an official reveal takes place.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s A4a set, set to release next week, follows on from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4-card-set-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wisdom of Sea and Sky A4 set</a> released last month and is once again focused on the second generation of Pokémon.</p>



<h2 id="h-suicune-raikou-amp-entei-star-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4a-set">Suicune, Raikou, &amp; Entei Star in Pokémon TCG Pocket A4a Set</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a leaked trailer <a href="https://x.com/UniteVids/status/1958758609996714277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), pack art featuring Suicune was ripped open to reveal a host of new cards, including Suicune ex, before a transition to a volcano environment where Entei ex appeared. Then, Raikou ex made an appearance.</p>



<p>The legendary trio will clearly be the stars of the new set, which could be the penultimate set before a big shake-up in Pokémon TCG Pocket that introduces Mega Evolution to the game.</p>



<p>Mega Evolutions’ arrival will mark the start of the second season in the game, potentially changing the rules and pushing the sets to ‘B’, though at this stage it’s merely speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has teased a “big update” later this year, though, which aligns with suggestions it could reformat the meta and transition into the next stage.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review.1277955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Where do you draw the line with a remake? How do you balance creative freedom and remaining true to the original? Everyone's answer is somewhat different, but for Konami, staying faithful was the top priority with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the 2004 stealth-action game that was led by Hideo Kojima. In not being shy about crediting Kojima and his team throughout, Konami preserved Snake Eater in a way that's nearly one-to-one, other than a massive visual overhaul. So while it has definitely aged in the 21 years since, there's a certain novelty to its old-school stealth-action gameplay and spy thriller story that still hits – especially with the way Snake Eater wraps up, how can you not be romantic about Metal Gear Solid all over again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've played Snake Eater, almost everything will be familiar to you. It's the same captivating story, delivered with the same mix of melodrama and absurdity to the backdrop of its Cold War-era historical fiction. Its penchant for long cutscenes steeped in political theater is intact, alongside over-the-top characters and cinematic stylings with a tinge of classic espionage drama; you can put it side by side with the original and they'll sync up just fine. The iconic gravelly voice of David Hayter as Snake lands with a warming familiarity – only he can get away with always asking questions that are just him repeating the last thing that was said over the Codec. Item boxes are all in the same spots, and they still pop out of guards when you hold them up at gunpoint or drop their bodies. Despite the upgrade in tech that makes everything look current-gen, the layout of each area is untouched; they remain broken up into their distinct sections separated by brief loading screens. That's all to say, Delta is Snake Eater as you remember it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Going in, I was unsure about the Unreal Engine 5 makeover, and having completed a 12-hour playthrough (and a full stealth non-lethal run) I'm still a little conflicted at times. Does that sheen atop the new photorealistic graphics take the edge off of the original's stylings? Not entirely. But there are moments when its campiness doesn't land as confidently in high fidelity. There's something uncanny about Ocelot howling to call backup or The Cobra unit's inexplicable superpowers, which don't have quite the same whimsy when punched up. However, you couldn’t cut these things out and still call this Snake Eater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tradeoff is generally worth it, because the jungles and mountain ranges look fantastic and give a density to these contained zones that wasn't as felt before. And in its prestige-level cutscenes, the revamped graphics really pay off. It's one of those rose-tinted glasses situations, where this is how I remember it looking when I was blown away by the PS2 version as a teenager playing it for the first time. But now it actually does look this good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The spirit of Snake Eater persists.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami put in considerable effort to maintain Snake Eater's classic touches by offering the "Legacy Style" camera angle that uses the old bird's eye view, along with the original control scheme. As much as I appreciate the nostalgia, though, the "New Style" is the optimal way to play. It uses an over-the-shoulder angle gives a modern perspective that doesn't detract from the way it was meant to be played, which we already knew because the 2012 3DS version and other re-releases used this camera angle as well. I also prefer it because you get to see Delta’s newfound detail closer to the ground level, and it’s been made less rigid and more accommodating by some new accessibility options. Even little things, like being able to use the original UI elements along with New Style camera, show it isn't stubborn about letting you tailor things to your liking. Unexpectedly, the most impactful option for me was the color filters – I played the entire game with the Legacy filter and found it much better than the somewhat sterile default look. As someone very attached to the specific color palette and aesthetic of the original Snake Eater, this was close enough for me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the thing I enjoyed most about this remake was that I found the old-school stealth action to be oddly refreshing. At a time when series like Splinter Cell, Thief, and, well, Metal Gear Solid are largely absent in the modern gaming world, playing through Snake Eater tapped into that part of my brain again. Each section feels like a puzzle to be solved, where guards and terrain are your obstacles and your limited gear leaves room for creativity. I was reminded about how reactivity is a defining feature of the Metal Gear series – whether I'm dropping dirty magazines to distract guards or popping out of a cardboard box for a close-quarters takedown, that mix of deliberate decisions and adapting when plans don't exactly work out remains satisfying. The thrill of evading an alert phase while hiding within inches of patrolling guards matches the high of pulling off a perfect no-kill stealth run, and toying with the guards once you understand their behavior can be as fun as going in guns blazing. I still hold MGSV: The Phantom Pain in high regard for its "emergent gameplay," but Snake Eater's more contained scope makes for a throwback that represents what made Metal Gear Solid so much fun to begin with.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Snake Eater's camouflage system works the same here, so you can expect different uniforms and face paint to affect your camo percentage based on the terrain you're in. It was innovative back in 2004 and is still a welcome layer of depth to the tried-and-true stealth gameplay that we haven’t seen often since, especially when it has a genuine impact on what you can get away with in different environments. There’s a convenient change in that you can access camo presets by holding up on the D-pad so you don't have to always go into the menus to make a tweak. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The injury system is back, and although it's a pain to keep patching up Snake after every mistake, it's on you to be careful and stay stocked with medical supplies. The hunger system remains an interesting wrinkle that's a smart alternative to typical health meters of other games, pushing you to hunt or find rations to keep Snake fed so his health replenishes over time (and to make sure his tummy doesn't grumble too loud). This kind of mechanic is common now, but it’s interesting to remember that Snake Eater predated the survival games today, and it's good to see these mechanics have aged well.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's Top 10 Metal Gear Games Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate that the controls have been mostly modernized to align with how third-person games are typically played today, including quality of life improvements to CQC and mobility that's similar to MGSV: The Phantom Pain. But some of the annoying quirks of movement and interacting with the environment haven't really changed. Having Snake stick to cover, make miniscule movements in certain directions, and connect on melee attacks can be frustrating, even if it's the sort of friction I'm used to putting up with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The higher difficulties provide a fun challenge and replayability, but when I took a step back, Snake Eater is understandably not quite as expansive as it felt 20 years ago. Relative to modern games it feels rather small in scope, and its challenges aren't as complex as I once thought, and that comes with the territory of an stubbornly faithful remake. Enemy density is a bit sparse the gameplay dynamic doesn't evolve much the deeper you go. Even if shooting a tranq dart into every guard's head is the easiest solution, Metal Gear Solid is at its best when treating it as a playground for improvising.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Snake Eater is understandably not quite as expansive as it felt 20 years ago.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss fights are another area where Konami might’ve played it a little too safe by not sprucing them up in some way, so they’re still hit-or-miss depending on what you're asked to do. There are dull ones like The Pain or The Fear, where you're just waiting for a window to pop your shots. On the other hand, you have classics like The End's cat-and-mouse shootout and The Sorrow's novel meta-layer that remind me that Snake Eater was thinking outside the box and doing things that only Metal Gear was at the time. And if you remember any of the old tricks and secrets from the original versions, just know that they all still work in Delta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The storytelling didn’t really need changes, because to me, this one's timeless. I'm a sucker for Kojima and company’s embellished political drama, and with the backdrop of the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, inserting their flavor of government conspiracy is captivating to indulge in. For all its stone-faced goofiness, Snake Eater has a story that hit in a way I didn't expect when I was younger – and after all these years, I felt a new wave of emotions revisiting it as an adult. That's due in large part to the enigmatic relationship between Snake and The Boss; it's conveyed with a certain earnestness, leading to revelations that brought things full circle for Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid as a whole at the time it came out. This culminates in what I still consider the best moments in the entire series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even twerps like Ocelot earn his respect through a rivalry with Snake that has its own little story arc. And aside from The Boss, Eva remains one of my favorite characters in the series, stealing every scene she's in and playing an important role of an agent you can't get a read on until the very end. (I do wish the story didn't treat her so poorly at certain moments, so I can’t say Delta wouldn’t have benefitted from a couple of changes in this regard.) For as much flack as Metal Gear may get for its lengthy cinematics, Snake Eater is a focused story told at a fairly brisk pace, and it knows when to pull its far-fetched punches.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Snake Eater is a focused story told at a fairly brisk pace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Weaving in grainy old footage from historical archives alongside Yoji Shinkawa's art direction to ground its story is still effective. These touches add texture to what's at stake for Snake: fail and be used as a scapegoat for your government, or succeed and become an unknown hero. Both are tragic in their own ways. Yet, with the inexplicable supernatural edge to its villains, this is a series best enjoyed with a particular suspension of disbelief – also for the silliness that comes with conversations about real-life movies with your remote assistant Para-Medic. That leaves room for its cinematic flair, seen in iconic moments like climbing the ladder to an acapella rendition of the Snake Eater theme song and pivotal conversations on a flower field amid conflict breaking out at the Soviet border. This is a series known for letting you infiltrate top-secret military facilities by hiding in conspicuous cardboard boxes; no one does camp like Metal Gear Solid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, for all its adherence to the original, I wondered: did we need this remake? Is there a way Delta could've been a much higher elevation of the original Snake Eater? Yeah, I'm sure, and we have faithful remakes like Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill 2 to look at, for example. That's not what Konami set out to do though, so I'm left to acknowledge the ways it doesn't quite hold up today, and appreciate the things that make it timeless. Delta didn't necessarily elevate my love for Snake Eater, but it did remind me of why I've held it in high regard all this time.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’m far from alone in the assertion that <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i> featured some of the best stealth mechanics of the series. Were they packaged with a story and overall level design that did them justice? I say no to that, but I can’t deny that <i>MGSV</i> plays like a dream. Oh, and the plot twist was super neat, for the record.</p> <p>When <i>Delta</i>, the remake of 2004’s <i>Snake Eater</i>, was announced, many an <i>MGS</i> fan hoped that the game would play similarly to <i>MGSV</i>, and would perhaps even run on the celebrated Fox Engine.</p> <p>Folks, I’m here to tell you that’s not the case. As I alluded to in my review of the fancy new remake, <i>Delta</i> plays much like the <i>MGS3</i> you remember from just about any of its re-releases over the years. Plus, it runs on Unreal. And in my experience, that worked out well. I experienced very few technical issues during my time with a pre-release build provided by Konami. I was not thinking about graphics engines; I was fully immersed.</p>

 <p>But let’s have a chat about how this game plays in its moment-to-moment gameplay and put <i>Delta</i> under the microscope to compare it against <i>The Phantom Pain</i> and the original <i>Snake Eater</i> as it exists in the current <i>Master Collection</i>.</p> <h2><span id="movement-and-shooting"></span>Movement and shooting<span></span></h2> <p><i>Delta </i>and <i>MGSV</i> feel very different in motion, but it does feel like there’s a similar animation framework under the hood. <i>Delta</i> has a slower pace to it. <i>MGSV</i>’s Venom Snake is a bit choppier in his movements (not choppy in a bad way, but he has a kind of rigid urgency in how he moves that doesn’t feel present in <i>Delta</i>). Play some animations next to each other and you’ll see similarities, but to me, both with what I can see and what I have felt while playing <i>Delta</i> for 30 hours, the new remake feels smoother even compared to the impressive, and somewhat speedier, gameplay of <i>MGSV</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619227">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unlike <i>MGSV</i>, <i>Delta</i> does not feature a sprint option. Snake’s speed when you’re pushing forward on the analog stick (or the W key on keyboard) without using the stalking feature is his top speed. In my opinion, sprint wouldn’t have worked in the remake as the environments are just too small. They feel as dense and lush as a jungle should be, but even compared to those in <i>MGS4</i>, these environments are smaller. It’s a PS2 game after all!</p>

 <p>Snake’s forward roll from the 2000-era <i>MGS</i> games is back and it functions like you remember it. You can roll into enemies to damage them. Rolling is key to non-lethally damaging certain bosses, and is especially important when trying to beat Volgin without “killing” him.</p> <p>Snake can now hop over waist-high cover like in <i>MGSV</i>, something not possible in the original.</p> <p>A very odd, basically insignificant change for all but the most diehard <i>MGS</i> freaks (and I’m one) is that flattening yourself against an opened locker door does not close the door. Does this matter? Here, no. There aren’t many lockers in the jungle. Should we ever see a <i>Delta</i>-fied <i>MGS2</i>, however, I’ll make a case for keeping this quirk in that game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619217"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619217">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Comparing the feeling of guns is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/13u1iyr/the_crocodile_seen_in_mgs3_is_known_as_an_indian/">a tough gavial</a> to wrestle as <i>MGSV</i> features a wildly different palette of weaponry with different ammo counts, even among similar categories. Also, <i>MGSV</i> let you upgrade weapons to improve their performance. No such mechanic exists in <i>Delta</i>. What you find is what you get.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619214">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Delta</i>’s shooting feels like it splits the difference between the over-the-shoulder standard we see in every damn third-person shooter these days and what exists in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>. You can swap camera orientation to the left or right on the fly, like in <i>MGSV</i>. And the speed of shooting feels a touch closer to <i>MGSV</i>, but only on a very superficial level. It still feels like the pacing of <i>Snake Eater</i>, and you kinda have to play it to really feel what I’m talking about here. You’ll experience this most directly if you get caught and have to shoot your way out of a situation.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619215">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A non-animation-related change <i>Delta</i> makes from the original concerns how the tranquilizer pistol functions. There’s a distinct bullet (dart?) drop over a distance, Making this pistol dramatically less OP. To me, this is a huge win as the tranquilizer gun, while essential for the series’ meta commentary on violence, made it too easy to quickly put a number of guards to sleep, often diluting the sneaking experience. In <i>Delta</i>, you’re gonna have to get closer to the enemy if you want to put them to sleep without doing a bunch of physics in your head to calculate where that dart is going to land. This makes for a more challenging and immersive experience.</p> <h2><span id="closequarterscombat-(cqc)"></span>Close-Quarters-Combat (CQC)<span></span></h2> <p><i>MGS3</i> introduced CQC to the series, deepening the way you would enter and leave combat. Before this, Snake had a simple punch-punch-kick animation and the ability to flip an enemy or grab them in a chokehold, from which you could either knock them out through strangulation or snap their little digital necks.</p>

 <p><i>MGSV</i> expanded CQC to include all manner of new moves such as throwing an enemy up against a wall, stealing their gun, or going all Neo on a swarm of enemies with a rapid series of punches on multiple targets when surrounded. In <i>Delta</i>, you still get that old familiar punch-punch-kick animation with three taps of the melee button. It feels a little awkward to be honest, being mapped to the right trigger on a controller, but that button serves as your CQC command here, just as it does in <i>MGSV</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619219">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Snake’s moveset is otherwise just like it was in the original (at least as far as I can tell after 30 hours). You can grab with similar speed and movements; you can toss an enemy down to the ground by combining the CQC button with a directional movement. This feels easier to do in the <i>Remake</i> than it does in the original. Holding enemies up at gunpoint, however, is a little trickier. You have to be <i>real </i>close to do it. I didn’t hold up enemies a whole lot during my playthrough as I found I wasn’t close enough and ended up getting spotted too often. Maybe with future playthroughs I’ll get a better sense of that, but it feels harder than it did in the original, and even compared to <i>MGSV.</i></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619224">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>CQC in <i>Delta</i> sticks very close to how it was in the original game. There’s a more dramatic flair at work in the animation that can sometimes feel different, but Snake typically grabs and tosses enemies at a similar pace as in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>.</p>

 <h2><span id="it-feels-like-snake-eater,-it-tastes-like-snake-eater-(with-a-bit-of-hot-sauce)"></span>It feels like <i>Snake Eater</i>, it tastes like <i>Snake Eater </i>(with a bit of hot sauce)<span></span></h2> <p>While <i>Delta</i> has clearly taken some cues from <i>MGSV</i>, and maybe it even borrowed some animations here and there, the experience of playing this remake almost never feels like <i>Phantom Pain</i>. Yes, Snake can now crouch walk and transition to crawling in a way that doesn’t exist in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>, but otherwise everything feels like an analog copy of the original. Analog in the sense that it’s not a pure copy, and features a few quirks of its own.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619221"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619221">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When in battle, <i>Delta</i> also feels dramatically more similar to its original in my experience. <i>Phantom Pain</i> is snappier, faster, conceived as a modern third-person shooter. The new camera style of <i>Delta</i> can make things easier (veterans should probably start on Hard mode, as I mentioned in my review), but you’re still in trouble when the enemies spot you and start increasing in number. It is hard, as it was in the original, to shoot your way out of situations. <i>MGSV</i>, in my experience, could let you be more of a bloody menace if you so desired. <i>Delta</i>, however, aims to preserve the outnumbered, outgunned feeling of the original.</p> <p><i>Delta</i>’s unique additions to the <i>Snake Eater</i> formula feel grounded in its roots with gentle modern modifications. A <i>Snake Eater</i> mod of <i>MGSV</i> this is not.&nbsp;So if you’re like me and hold that 2000’s-era <i>MGS</i> experience in high regard, get ready for a wildly satisfying modern tweak of a legendary stealth game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s an exciting time for <i>Metal Gear Solid </i>fans such as myself. We’re not only about to get a remake of one of the best <i>MGS</i> games of all time, but also a new take on the classic stealth gameplay that made it so memorable. Earlier this month, I and several other journalists were invited to a <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> event to get some lengthy time in with the game and to check out the super cool installation at NYC’s Lightbox studio that housed a recreation of the iconic flower bed of the game’s final showdown. Along with Michael McWhertor of <i>Polygon</i> and Destin Legarie of <i>The Destin Channel</i>, I got to chat with <i>Delta</i>’s producers, Noriaki Okamura and Yuji Korekado.</p> <p>What follows is a transcript of our roundtable conversation, with some slight edits for brevity and clarity. Konami provided a translator for our interview.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Michael McWhertor, <i>Polygon</i>:</strong> There’s been a lot of remakes in recent years, especially at Konami, and I wondered when you started working on this project how much you wanted to do this as a reinterpretation, or as a straight remake. Did you wanna add to it? Did you want to make <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> through the lens of 2025? What was that approach like? Was it a straight remake or something else?</p>

 <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura, Producer, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>:</strong> This is something we contemplated at the very beginning when we were starting this project: What would be the best way to do a remake of <i>MGS3</i>? And in those conversations what we ultimately decided on for <i>Delta </i>is [that] the concept of <i>Delta </i>is to be able to have new <i>Metal Gear</i> fans, new<i> Metal Gear </i>players to experience the original as is, as much as possible. Obviously we did the modernization that we need to so that it will be more fluid and more accepting to modern gamers and how they play games but in order for us to respect what was originally great about the game, we wanted to keep it as is as much as possible.</p>  <p><strong>Destin Legarie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL"><i>The Destin Channel</i></a>:</strong> You’ve had a few preview sessions and you’ve gotten some feedback online. What changes have you been able to implement based on that online feedback today?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado, Creative Producer, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>:</strong> So one of the things we did is that, after we announced that we’re gonna do a remake, obviously there were a lot of reactions from a lot of <i>Metal Gear </i>fans and one of the things that really stood out to us is some of the additional modes that were, you know, removed, and because this game has been re-released so many times, and so some of them were they really wanted Snake Versus Monkey back, or, like, the Secret Theater videos back. After we we saw that there’s so much demand for it we decided, OK, what can we do to make those modes come back and what kind of way would be best to bring them back? So we did look into that kind of feedback.</p>

 <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> Specifically, I’ve seen a lot of feedback about some of the facial animations. Has that feedback been taken to heart?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> Yes, we did get that kind of feedback. We heard them loud and clear and especially after we released some of the earlier trailers, that’s definitely something that was pointed out to us and like I said, we want to make sure the experience that we provide in the remake is the same kind of experience that the people who played the original experience had. We wanna make sure that wow factor is still there, so after that we definitely wanted to make sure that the quality is on par to what a <i>Metal Gear </i>game needs to be.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619261"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619261">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Claire Jackson, <i>Kotaku</i>:</strong> What was it like balancing modern stealth mechanics with the stealth challenges of the original game?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> One of the things we did for <i>Delta</i> is to provide two types of what we call “Play Styles.” We have the Legacy Style which you can play kind of with a similar camera and controls as the original, and the new style you can play with more modern controls and a third-person camera setting. And when we allowed that new type of play style, we had to make some adjustments, some rebalancing because the way that you can now see the map changes how you need to hide and what you can see and what you can look out for. So one of the things we changed was the character animation, character motions and also the reactions and the responses of of some of the NPCs, the AI as well, and we needed to do that because allowing a different kind of angle, different kind of play style changes the thrill, the nervousness of needing to hide. So this is something that we had to go back and do a lot of testing with, utilizing modern technology to make it feel [like] that same nervousness as you were playing in the original style, but with a new modern control and camera.</p>

 <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> Do you feel that modernization might make it too easy? Because I remember when [the GameCube remake of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, <i>The Twin Snakes </i>came out, a lot of the criticism was that having that extra perspective made gameplay easier and the game easy.</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> To simply put it, yes, we knew this would happen, obviously. So, we had to do a lot of rebalancing between when you’re playing the Legacy Style versus the New Style, we had to make sure that the difficulty level would still match whatever playstyle you’re playing with and not make things too easy or too difficult.</p>

  <p><strong>Claire Jackson:</strong> Does the team have a preference between the original, overhead camera or or the third person one?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So, for [me] personally, [I love] both. Obviously modern players are more used to the third person camera and you know, specific types of controls. So for [new players] we want them to play with New Style first and because we think that this is the best way for them to get immersed into<i> Metal Gear</i>’s world in that way that they’re more used to. And once they cleared the game it will be fun for them to go back and replay the game in Legacy Style and see, “oh my goodness, there’s a whole new way of playing this game that I didn’t even know about,” so we would love for them to enjoy both Play Styles.</p> <p><strong>Michael McWhertor:</strong> I’m wondering if any technical issues came up developing certain aspects of the game? And I’m specifically thinking about how easy it was on the PlayStation 2 to, say, change the date, on your PlayStation 2 [to defeat the sniper boss, The End], whereas now on a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X or a PC, it’s, it’s more difficult to change the date on your system because it’s connected to the internet, and I’m wondering if you have a technical solution to that issue or if any other technical issues popped up?</p>

 <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So just with how we were able to adapt [the game] to the consoles and platforms back then, we were able to do that for all the the supported platforms that [<i>Delta</i>] is going to come out on today, and you know there’s different features on different types of platforms and features that we wanted to incorporate as well. For instance, we like the [rumble] feedback on the [PS5’s DualSense]. These are the types of things that we did really look into to make sure that we do what we can to best adapt [the game] to modern consoles as much as possible. In terms of technical difficulties, we didn’t really have too much, yeah.</p> <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> I know we’re here for <i>Delta </i>today, and we’re running low on time. I have so much that I want to ask but I would get in trouble if I didn’t ask about <i>Metal Gear </i>[<i>Solid</i>]<i> 4</i>. Is there any hope you can give for fans about <i>MGS4</i> possibly being in Volume 2 [of the <i>Master Collection</i>] or is it being worked on in any capacity?</p> <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura:</strong> This is something that we’re always, always thinking about: What is our next move in terms of the <i>Metal Gear</i> series, and we are aware that a lot of fans really want <i>MGS4 </i>back because it’s currently not playable on any current hardware or platforms, and this is something we do want to address at some point, making sure that fans can have a chance to play it once again. Unfortunately we can’t give you any more details other than that, but yeah, hopefully in the future this is something we can do.</p> <p><strong>Claire Jackson:</strong> Were there any unique challenges or surprises when it came to preserving the cinematic flair of the original [<i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>]?</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619262">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So for the cutscenes, we had to remake everything: The character models, the level, the stages, we had to do it all from scratch. And when we did that, one of our concerns was that even though everything looks amazing, if we still kept the same facing, the same camera angles, would it still hold up? And so once everything was done and we decided to create all the cinematics using the same camera, using the same background music, voice acting, we were blown away because the way that [<i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>] was built originally was already perfect to begin with and the the modern graphics just enhanced that to the fullest. So we were very surprised that, you know, even to this day the way it was originally made was, you know, [it] didn’t need to be retouched.</p>

              <p>I find myself in a simulation of a simulation, a modern recreation of a fictional jungle that I and many others fought and persisted through decades ago. As I crawl through the grass, sneak through Soviet weapons facilities, and survive on the animals of the wild, my mind oscillates through deja vu, the pleasant stupor of nostalgia, and the thrill of a sophisticated stealth experience that challenges my reflexes as well as my ability to plan several steps ahead to stay in control of dangerous situations. An inspired story threads these sneaking sequences together, telling a tale of fractured relationships, the pain they cause, and how grand forces beyond our control shape us. I’ve been here before; I’m struck with a strange feeling of being caught between memory and newness. As I crawl through the mud, I think, is this an authentic experience? Is this a substitute for the “real thing” that came ages ago? I take a step forward. “Huh? Footsteps? Is someone there?” says someone around the corner. It’s time to put those thoughts about reality, simulations, and authenticity to the side; I’ve a mission to complete. Into the fray I go, silently, swiftly, with new, deadly precision.</p> <hr> <p>To remake <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> is an interesting proposition. The winding, cryptic narrative of the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> series starts with the events of <i>Snake Eater</i>. It’s a prequel, and a well-written, rightly celebrated one at that. It also represents a maturation of the formula series creator Hideo Kojima, along with the team of developers at Konami, started with 1998’s <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. <i>Snake Eater</i> digs deeper into the series’ stealth focus, with enemies more attuned to the sounds of your footsteps and more capable of spotting you from a greater distance. You also have to contend with needs such as hunger and treating your wounds, and using camouflage is essential to staying out of sight.</p> <p>With the games that followed <i>MGS3</i>, the series began to lose much of its identity, becoming less an evolution of the original <i>Metal Gear </i>games that arrived on MSX in the late ‘80s and more a response to the third-person shooters of the Xbox 360 and PS3 era. With <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>, we drifted even further from the original mold, embracing an open-world format, fracturing the traditional narrative structure many were used to, and perhaps most controversially, replacing the iconic voice of the American version of Snake while eliminating such series’ staples&nbsp; as dedicated “codec” conversations. This fractured series identity is what <i>Delta</i> steps into.</p>

 <p>Fans of that original <i>MGS</i> experience might feel like we’ve lost our way from the kind of stealth and narrative adventures that we cherished so much in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s. <i>Delta</i> arrives as a potential reset for that, and succeeds with flying camo colors as a remarkably faithful remake of one of the all-time greats of our medium.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619271"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619271">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>After <i>MGS2</i>’s switcheroo forced players to contend with a protagonist who, to put it mildly, challenged the masculine archetype the series had centered up to that point, <i>MGS3</i> recenters traditional, Kurt Russell-inspired masculinity, the kind that defines itself through rugged violence essentialized as a struggle against nature; a thing to fight, a thing to kill, a thing to consume. And the women of the game are eager to show as much tits and ass as an M rating would allow at the time.</p> <p><i>MGS3</i>, and by extension <i>Delta</i>, is prone to complicated, often incorrect, assumptions about governments and economic systems, and its wiser moments can all too quickly be overshadowed by the excitement of wielding deadly weapons without caution and smashing up commies in the East. Still, it’s important to see <i>MGS3</i> as a bold reaffirming of what worked in <i>MGS</i> and a rejection of what didn’t, in the eyes of some, in <i>MGS2</i>. <i>Snake Eater</i> would go on to be one of the most celebrated <i>MGS</i> titles. Now we’re here in 2025, and once again <i>Snake Eater </i>exists as a kind of course correction for the series; it’s an opportunity to take the missteps of <i>MGSV</i>, its open-world structure that often felt directionless and bland, its fractured narrative that was hard to parse for a story already playing with some high level concepts, and correct them.</p>

 <p>In doing so, <i>Delta </i>stands to remind us of just how powerful this era of <i>MGS</i> was, when it was laser focused on captivating, linear level structure, along with a story you could enjoy as you would a film, not the disconnected threads that <i>Phantom Pain</i> asked players to stitch together themselves. It also streamlines those aspects of the original that saw you spending much of your time diving through cumbersome menus, and offers a more traditional camera and aiming experience via its “New Style” mode, which the game defaults to. It also, naturally, delivers the high level of graphical fidelity we expect from a modern AAA game, though some purists may take offense at differences in color grading (they should really just go play the original if it bothers them that much). I’d argue this stylistic change is in line with what <i>Snake Eater</i> was always aspiring to, and is in keeping with what Kojima envisioned for the future of the series, which was to bring it even closer to photorealism.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619272" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619272"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619272">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>And so, we come back to Kojima, whose stamp is all over <i>Snake Eater </i>and who is nonetheless conspicuously absent from <i>Delta. </i>To be frank, the lack of Kojima on this project feels weird, even preposterous. Would we accept a <i>Twin Peaks</i> “remake” or fourth season without David Lynch? Would we tolerate a shot-for-shot remake of <i>The Matrix</i> without the participation of the Wachowski sisters? Crazy talk! Would we even want those things if their creators <i>were </i>intimately attached?</p>

 <p>But of course, for all the genius and talent David Lynch gave to <i>Twin Peaks</i>, what would that show be without <a href="https://youtu.be/e-eqgr_gn4k">the incredible compositions of Angelo Badalamenti</a>? Would <i>The Matrix</i> have warped our minds in the same way without <a href="https://youtu.be/jYk0WHcmrYo">the technical and creative genius of John Gaeta</a>, who was able to bring bullet time to life? It is so often the case that the works which we remember and cherish dearly are collaborative works, brought to life by far more than just the director’s name.</p> <p>Video games are no different. While <i>MGS</i> wouldn’t exist without the enthusiastic, eccentric creative energy of Hideo Kojima, it takes far more than one person to build a video game as ambitious as any <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. Major AAA titles are team efforts, and success can never be attributed to any one individual. Who’s to say what <i>MGS</i> would’ve been like if even one other person on the teams that built these games were swapped out?</p>

 <p><i>Delta</i> makes no attempt at hiding the work of Hideo Kojima, with his name showing up a number of times in the opening credits. With very limited exceptions that will certainly be dissected vigorously by the <i>MGS</i> fanbase, the camera work in the cutscenes stays true to that in the original with frightening accuracy. The environment and characters look incredible, conveying well the emotional depth the original aimed for with its lofty cinematic goals. Add the fact that the game uses the original’s voice acting and music, and the combined effect plays a trick on the mind: <i>Delta</i> gave me both the thrills of a modern, polished AAA game and an active dose of nostalgia for the PS2 era in all the best ways.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619273" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619273"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619273">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>When that camera is turned over to you, the default settings give you a different kind of perspective than what <i>Snake Eater</i> originally shipped with. You can freely rotate the camera, you can even move in first person like you could in <i>MGS4 </i>and <i>V</i>, though at a slower pace. You press the left trigger to raise your weapon, you fire it with the right. You reload with a face button.</p>

 <p>For all these modern comforts, however, the game still feels like it’s playing in the world that <i>MGS, Sons of Liberty</i>, and the original <i>Snake Eater</i> built. Smartly, the d-pad becomes of use in a way that preserves the left and right corners of the screen as your dedicated item and weapon management system. Gone is the more <i>Gears of War</i>-esque weapon selection system of <i>The Phantom Pain</i>. Added to this layout is an up-press on the d-pad to scroll through a selection of camo to change outfits way faster than you could in the original. You can also press down on the d-pad to bring up a new codec/radio menu and swiftly hop on a call with the game’s NPCs–and yes, you can still call Para-Medic to save your progress and enjoy snippets of cinema history afterwards.</p> <p>This streamlining takes elements of <i>Snake Eater</i> that once required you to sift through different screens to engage with them and instead places them in the heat of the moment, easier to reach for when you need them. In my experience, this improves the flow of <i>Snake Eater</i>’s gameplay so much that I prefer playing <i>Delta</i> over the original based on this alone. And while I have some serious reservations about the thought of any other <i>MGS</i> game getting remade, I have to say, if it’s going to play like <i>Delta</i>, have at it, Konami! (I will now hide under my desk to avoid getting struck by lightning.)</p> <p>Most mechanics remain largely faithful to the original, rather than undergoing the kind of deep expansion you might expect them to receive in a remake such as this. Close-quarters-combat, for instance, has not been expanded beyond some flashier animations that mostly occur during certain boss fights–one fight in particular relies on these fancier animations instead of a sound cue like the original did. This marks perhaps <i>Delta</i>’s most extreme deviation from the original.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619274"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619274">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>You can, however, crouch-walk. This was not in <i>MGS</i> DNA until <i>Guns of the Patriots</i>, and it’s a welcome modernization here; moving from cover, crouching, then going to a crawl all feels suitably smooth, sophisticated, and intuitive. It makes for a wildly impressive and immersive stealth experience that demands an adherence to form in the way you approach situations. You need to learn and memorize how best to turn corners, when and where to emerge from tall grass. <i>Snake Eater</i> encourages you to build those best practices, that stealth form, like an athlete training for an event; <i>Delta</i> gives you increased mobility and camerawork to be more immersed in the experience. It can make the game easier, however. With that in mind, I recommend that veterans of the original start on Hard difficulty unless they’re looking for a breezy first trip through.</p> <p>The one downside to the new camera style is that it can, on occasion, feel claustrophobically close. There’s no FOV slider, even on the PC version, and the game’s environments are smaller than what we’re used to in modern shooters.</p> <p>The pacing of the game has not changed much either. Snake moves at about the same speed as he did in the original. No sprint function was added, and things like swimming and wading through mud still feel like a chore. I think Konami could’ve stood to be a bit bolder by speeding that pace up, but it fits with a game that’s already trying to make its combat feel meatier and more impactful than that in a rapid, twitchy shooter. Despite feeling similar to modern games in terms of its controls, <i>Delta</i> also still feels like the original <i>Snake Eater</i>, not an <i>MGS3</i> overhaul mod for <i>MGSV</i> or something. Indeed, it feels more like classic <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> than any <i>MGS</i> game has in decades, without feeling like a retro throwback that requires a rewiring of your brain.</p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>Same great snake taste you love, now with four times the pixels!</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Konami</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person stealth action game.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Faithful recreation of a classic, wonderfully improved controls.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Lack of an FOV slider, some slower elements of the original remain.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>August 28, 2025 (playable on August 26 for those who pre-order the deluxe version).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>30 hours on a non-lethal, never-spotted run on the game’s Hard difficulty setting using the “New Style” camera.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p>That extends to the menu systems, which have all of the character and detail that they exuded in the original. Eat a snake, and you’ll sometimes see a little cutscene of our protagonist chowing down, followed up by the sound of him chewing, swallowing, and commenting on how tasty it was. The game will play the audio every time you eat, as it did in the original. The remake could’ve given us an option to skip as it does feel a little tedious and repetitive when you’re more than a dozen hours into the game.</p>

 <p><i>MGS3</i> was always far from my favorite <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. It lacked <i>MGS2</i>’s fourth-wall-breaking meta stuff that had me captivated, putting me in a weird liminal space where I obsessed about what the purpose of a “sequel” even is. Its plot twists, in my opinion, don’t match up to the wild revelations of the first <i>MGS</i> or, for that matter, those of <i>MGSV</i> later on. And its survival mechanics always slowed the action down too much for me. But <i>Delta</i> really helped me appreciate what this game is by breaking down the rigid barriers of the original’s menu-diving while giving me a more sophisticated set of movement options and camera controls. And the game is visually impressive not just because it’s a modern-day AAA game with the horsepower of our modern consoles and GPUs. There’s real care in the presentation, from the improved fidelity of facial animations to carry those wonderfully well-written lines of dialogue, to bits of grass, leaves, and sticks getting stuck to your clothes and falling off as you move around. <i>Delta</i>’s graphics got more than a few “wows” out of me.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619275">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve got my critiques of that 2004 premiere of Snake in the jungle, but there’s no denying that the original <i>Snake Eater</i> will remain one of the greatest games of all time and people should play it if they care about the history of this medium, and to see how the now humble processing power of the PS2 was pushed to its extreme to tell a captivating story about shifting allegiances, broken relationships, and the threat we humans pose to ourselves by using our intellect to build super weapons. For those returning to this jungle, expect a faithful and respectful rearticulation of a game you loved–and if you didn’t love it, maybe the slight modernizations will win you over as they did for me.</p>

 <p>Should someone come across <i>Snake Eater</i> for the first time with <i>Delta</i>, they’ll find a phenomenal modern stealth experience housed in the kind of classic narrative and linear structure that modern games have been neglecting far too often in their quests to make their worlds bigger. <i>Delta </i>knows its subject matter can stimulate the imagination, and no piece of silicon can out muscle that.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </i>modernizes the classic mechanics of the original while preserving the breathlessly tense feeling of its stealth gameplay, and its painstakingly accurate recreation of the original’s aesthetic and vibrantly beating cinematic heart preserve so much of why these games have withstood the test of time. Should <i>Delta </i>be not just a one-off but the dawn of a new generation for <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, it’s a promising one indeed.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Platinum Games, the developer of acclaimed action titles including Bayonetta and Nier: Automata, contributed to the development of Konami's Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami has confirmed. Specifically, Platinum created a new version of Snake's Nightmare, an Easter egg that longtime fans of MGS3 will no doubt relish the return of.</p><p dir="ltr">Snake's Nightmare is a third-person action sequence that is accessed by saving the game when Snake is captured and thrown in prison. When the save file is reloaded, instead of going back to the prison, players wake up in a hellish otherworld where a mysterious man wielding hook-swords takes on demons in a graveyard.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The minigame, also known to fans as Guy Savage, was originally written and directed by Shuyo Murata, who contributed to a number of other Metal Gear Solid projects as part of the original Kojima Productions team. Although Metal Gear Solid 3 has been re-released in various forms since its debut on the PlayStation 2, Snake's Nightmare/Guy Savage has been omitted in the majority of them.</p><p dir="ltr">For Delta, a complete and faithful remake of the original MGS3, Konami went the extra mile and brought in Platinum to rebuild the hidden mode. As stated in our review, it's an excellent return for the easter egg. Platinum are masters of the action game genre and previously collaborated with Konami on Metal Gear Rising: Reveagance, a spin-off focused on Raiden. Their expertise is very much on show in Snake's Nightmare, which feels sharp and satisfying to play.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>, we gave the game a 9/10, saying it is "a safe but successful modernization of a beloved classic" and a "gorgeous game that brings MGS3 to life in stunning new detail."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a>'s Joker has made surprise appearances in games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and now he's making his way to Blizzard's free-to-play hero shooter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/overwatch_2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The Season 18 trailer has gone live and it finishes with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a> theme along with a silhouette of Joker. Atlus has also acknowledged the collaboration, which will go live on <strong>26th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's some additional PR about the upcoming season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bigger battles and bolder strategies await in Season 18: Stadium Quick Play!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Stadium Quick Play is here with shorter match times, quicker Item economy, backfill support, and Cross Play! Dominate as Winston, Brigitte, and Pharah at season launch, and shake things up with Tracer when she arrives in Stadium during Mid-season.</p>
<p>We’re also bringing a brand new game mode to Stadium with Payload Race, 3 new maps, and the new Draft Mode which gives players a pre-match advantage, enabling smart counter-picks and better team coordination.</p>
<p>Make a splash with Wuyang, the prodigy from Wuxing University and our newest Support Hero. With a skillset built for tactical repositioning and team utility, Wuyang rewards players who thrive on timing, precision, and adaptability.</p>
<p>Over 50 new Perks are arriving at launch, with each Hero getting at least one new one! In addition to new Perks, Season 18 is also bringing a Competitive Rank Reset, allowing a fresh start for everyone.</p>
<p>And we’ve only just starched the surface! Look out for Sojourn’s brand-new Ultraviolet Sentinel Mythic Skin, the new Season 18 Premium Battle Pass, and so much more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows on from collaborations with series like <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>One Punch Man</strong>. In more recent times, Blizzard has also teamed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> to offer unique collaboration skins based on Capcom's fighting game roster.</p>
<p>When we hear more about this latest crossover, we'll share an update. For now, you can see the latest season trailer in the video above. And in case you missed it, Atlus will also be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> to the Switch 2 on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a social media post, the Splitgate 2 development team at 1047 Games promoted the #StopKillingGames campaign. It was seen as somewhat ironic by some gamers, and they took to the comment section under the post to jibe or berate 1047 following the disastrous, self-imploding launch of Splitgate 2 in June.</p>



<p>After Splitgate 2 failed to make a mark in June, hampered by controversial comments and decisions made by 1047 Games’ leadership team, the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled back to beta</a>. The fans left waiting are now holding out for <strong>another launch</strong>, but we don’t know when that’ll be.</p>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-2-didn-t-make-fps-great-again">Splitgate 2 Didn’t Make FPS Great Again</h2>



<p>The downfall of Splitgate 2 began when 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx took to the stage at Summer Game Fest to make some controversial statements about his title. He was wearing a hat emblazoned with the message <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/">‘Make FPS Great Again’</a>, which was enough to trigger many gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Following that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some microtransaction prices</a> and design choices further impacted the Splitgate 2 launch, and once the creators moved away from the game, the player count crumbled.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the 1047 Games team was caught begging fans to still have faith:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">give us one more chance at our relaunch 🙏</p>— Splitgate 2 – Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1958637786728157577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The ‘one more chance’ comment was followed up with a similar sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally understand we’ve disappointed. Hope we’ll be able to earn your trust back!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And in another:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve definitely made some mistakes along the way, but supporting our community is always our top priority.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unlikely that Splitgate 2 will be able to make much of a splash when it does eventually re-emerge. The damage has been done, and despite the game boasting some innovative mechanics, players won’t forget what happened this year with the game’s original launch.</p>



<p>Are you waiting for Splitgate 2 to come out (again)? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following a string of controversies and concerns about child safety, Roblox has become the target of several campaigns demanding action, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-petition-ceo-resignation-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the resignation</a> of the CEO of the Roblox Corporation. Many believe that Roblox is shutting down in 2025, collapsing under the weight of all these scandals, but is it true, and will a Roblox ban surface this year?</p>



<p>It’s time to clear this up once and for all. Is Roblox getting shut down, and if not, why do so many people think it is?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-roblox-getting-shut-down-on-september-1st">Is Roblox Getting Shut Down on September 1st?</h2>



<p>Across social media and content platforms, a ‘hoax campaign’ was kicked off, claiming that Roblox will be banned from September 1st. This somewhat ludicrous claim came amidst an ongoing debate regarding the safety of children on the platform.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that there’s an inherent problem at the heart of Roblox. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-child-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being sued</a> by the state of Louisiana, Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is making a documentary</a> about it, and content creators are trapping malicious users on the platform.</p>



<p>But is this enough to warrant Roblox shutting down?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-roblox-shutting-down">When is Roblox Shutting Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Roblox is not shutting down on September 1st, or any other date. </strong>The game is not going to be taken offline because of the ongoing controversies, as it still functions as a popular platform for tens of millions of gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Roblox indeed has an insane and very public issue right now, but it’s not enough to bring the game to a complete shutdown.</p>



<p>If you’re one of the many users wondering if Roblox is being banned, fear not – the game is safe for now.</p>



<p>Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum if you have any concerns about the security of Roblox right now.</p>

<p>Get ready for "instant driving enjoyment"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's been announced another racing game is speeding onto the Switch 2 in the future. This time it's <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gear-club-unlimited-3">Gear.Club Unlimited 3</a></strong> and it's arriving at some point in "<strong>late 2025</strong>".</p>
<p>This game will follow on from the first two titles, which were released on the eShop during the original Switch generation. Apart from the teaser trailer above, Nacon has also shared some information about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3: Arcade Fun for Everyone - "Built for accessible fun and gameplay, <em>Gear.Club Unlimited 3</em> returns with a more complete formula. This new installment features two contrasting environments: the sunny Mediterranean coast and the twisting, mountainous roads of Japan. A brand-new "Highway" mode challenges players with dense traffic and high-speed moments. With over 40 officially licensed cars and a full career mode, this game offers instant driving enjoyment for all player types."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this new entry will include "contrasting environments" from the sunny Mediterranean coast to the twisting, mountainous roads of Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You don't need to spend over $2,000 to play the newest games in glorious 4K.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">You no longer have to pay an egregious sum of money to play games at a consistently solid framerate in glorious 4K resolution. Walmart is currently offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw1wD?object_uuid=1ec35d90-665e-4298-8458-39c19e2bdc58&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iBuypower Element Pro</a> gaming PC equipped with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU for just $1499 with free delivery. This was the best "high-end" gaming PC deal during Prime Day - better than anything I found on Amazon - and it's still the best deal I've seen so far at this price point. The Radeon RX 9070 XT is an outstanding graphics card that can run the latest games (like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6</a>) in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">iBuypower Element Pro Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC $1499</h2><div catalogid="bfc43746-9b7c-42f7-b829-b608cfd87865" id="224881"><div id="224881" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 9 7900X Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The iBuypower gaming PC is generously equipped across the board. It features an AMD Ryzen 9 7900X CPU, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB M.2 SSD. The Ryzen 9 7900X processor has a max boost clock of 5.6GHz with 12 cores and 24 threads. This is an excellent CPU for both gaming and multi-tasking and you won't need to upgrade from it for a long time. It's cooled by a very robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and runs off an 850W power supply.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a "perfect" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming. By "4K ready" I mean that this gaming PC can run pretty much any game at 4K resolution and at framerates of 60fps or higher. Any video card that's weaker and you'll have to compromise in order to get playable framerates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One side note is that the product photo doesn't accurately show what you're getting in terms of components. PC system builders like iBuyPower, Skytech, CyberPowerPC, and ABS use off-the-shelf parts that are available and cost effective at the time. So, for example, although the image shows what appears to be an Asus ROG Strix graphics card, you'll probably be getting the Asus PRIME card instead. If you want a PC that's made more assembly-line style with predictable components, your best bet is to stick with bigger PC builders like Dell, Lenovo, or HP.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Unboxed Benched the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Graphics Card During the Battlefield 6 Open Beta</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 beta just finished its two-weekend stint with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of players signing on to try it out. The initial impressions are mostly positive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">including those from our own IGN staff</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you looking to upgrade your rig specifically for this game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdPNxe7O_I&amp;t=407s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardware Unboxed</a> tested out a few different Radeon RX 9070 XT configurations in-game. At 4K and with the maximum "Ultra" preset, the RX 9070 XT rig maintained an average of 70-85fps with a 1% low of 67fps. This was tested with both lower-end AMD Ryzen 5 and higher-end AMD Ryzen 7 X3D processors and the performance difference was minimal, especially at higher resolutions (1440p and 4K) where games are typically less CPU limited. What's also impressive was that the GeForce RTX 5080 equipped PC only averaged about 8%-12% better, even though such a PC would run you over $2,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that these tests were not performed on a iBuyPower PC. Instead it is more of an indication of how well a typical RX 9070XT equipped gaming PC would perform in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day. When Eric isn't hunting for deals for other people at work, he's hunting for deals for himself during his free time. He is also an avid Battlefield gamer and absolutely played the heck out of the BF6 beta with over 200 matches across both weekends.

<p>Racing onto Switch 2 this November</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sakurai <em>finally</em> gave us our first proper look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> gameplay earlier this week, and based on what we've seen (and played) so far, it's not your average racing game.</p>
<p>If you want to know a bit more about what it's like, we've now put together this first impressions round up. We'll kick things off with thoughts from our video producer Felix Sanchez, who was able to go hands on with the title at Gamescom earlier this week:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's a lot we still haven't seen, but even this early on, there's so much variety... I had a really nice time racing with others and the controls feel extremely natural and easy to learn. Kirby is having a heck of a year on Switch 2"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So what do other outlets have to say about this new entry? Here are some of the previews so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/kirby-air-riders-preview-impressions-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Polygon</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even though <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> has a reputation for being simple, it’s deceptively complicated. That holds true in a sequel that’s even heavier on visual stimuli. The pace is faster, there are tons of enemies to whack, and using a power-up usually results in a massive explosion of color on-screen. Machines swerve around the tracks with loose movement that makes them feel like mechanical bulls at times."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://mashable.com/article/kirby-air-riders-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"By the time the five minutes are up, you might have a machine that's so fast that you can barely control it, or so powerful that it's unstoppable in the more combat-focused Stadium minigames. No two City Trial games feel the same. It's a little magical."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kirby Air Riders is so extremely not just a Mario Kart redux that riding around 150cc matches at home felt practically quaint. Wall rides and bar grinds? That’s cute. In Kirby Air Riders, I’m drifting corners so screamin’ fast that I barely had time to blink. Whirlpool traps and gentle river runs? How serene. Air Riders’ Waveflow Waters race course has <em>violent</em> vortexes and corridors of walls made of water to punch through. Oh, and brace yourself for a gigantic meteor shower of fireballs that reign down during City Trials too!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gamerant.com/kirby-air-riders-gameplay-city-trial-hands-on/">GameRant</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After over two decades, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feels like more than just a sequel or a revival of a cult classic. Rather, it's almost a full reinvention that refuses to be just another racing game. Air Ride scratches the competitive itch for anyone who loves speed and just wants to race, but it's City Trial that gives the sequel its unique identity, with a great deal of chaos and strategy that makes every match feel different. And then there's plenty of room for experimentation with all the different riders and machines to choose from."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Kirby Air Riders launches exclusively for the Switch 2 later this year on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. You can find out more about it in the Direct broadcast from earlier this week. We've also put together a round up of every announcement.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-stepping-down-replacement-named.1277805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longtime CEO of Bungie, Pete Parsons, is stepping down from his position as of today. The news came right in the midst of Gamescom, but a replacement has been named, fortunately. </p>



<p>Parsons, who joined the studio in 2003, has worked on several of the studio’s major titles, like Halo 2 and Destiny. Becoming CEO of the company in 2016, he helped launch Destiny 2 and worked with PlayStation on the studio’s controversial acquisition in 2022. For many, he has been the face of the company for quite a while, so the news is quite shocking.</p>



<h2 id="h-justin-truman-now-ceo-of-bungie-replacing-pete-parsons">Justin Truman Now CEO of Bungie, Replacing Pete Parsons</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are proud to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping up as Bungie’s new Studio Head as Pete Parsons retires from his position to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders.<a href="https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ">https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ</a></p>— Bungie (@Bungie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1958622787813122374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Bungie’s official website, memos from both Parsons and new CEO Justin Truman were posted. Parsons spoke on his leave, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation, and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,” Parsons said. “This journey has been the honor of a lifetime. I am deeply proud of the worlds we’ve built together and the millions of players who call them home – and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>New Bungie CEO, Justin Truman, also spoke on the matter in the post previously mentioned, stating,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds,” says Truman. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them.&nbsp;We are hard at work right now doing that – both with Marathon and Destiny. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Truman, who joined Bungie in 2010 to work on Halo Reach as an engineer, has spearheaded much of Destiny 2’s community efforts. In the game, he worked as the Gameplay Experience Director. It seems like the Bungie CEO change isn’t going to delay Marathon or Destiny, as far as we know. While Destiny 2 is still going strong with new expansions, Marathon has had some tough times getting out of the gate. Still, the multiplayer FPS plans to release before the fiscal year ends, though exact details are not clear.</p>



<p>Are you surprised by Parsons’ decision to leave Bungie? Do you think Truman is the best choice for CEO? Let us know in the comments and on the forums</p>

Settings are often personal preference, so you might want more or less sensitivity when hip firing or aiming, but for the most part, these settings will help you better refine your movement and aiming.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll likely want to adjust the sensitivity when using ground vehicles and tanks as well. Try boosting these sensitivity levels to around the same vertical and horizontal sensitivities you use for your operator. Personally, I only use ground vehicles and never fly the aircraft, but I assume those will need similar adjustments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4554496-deltaforcecontrollersens2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554496" data-ratio="0.56271929824561" data-width="2280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4554496-deltaforcecontrollersens2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554496"></a><figcaption>Controller sensitivity</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4554496-deltaforcecontrollersens2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Controller_sensitivity">Controller sensitivity</h3><h4 dir="ltr" id="Controller_Deadzone">Controller Deadzone</h4><p dir="ltr">Right Stick Center Deadzone - 10</p><p dir="ltr">Right Stick Maximum Input - 80</p><p dir="ltr">Left Stick Center Deadzone - 10</p><p dir="ltr">Right Stick Maximum Input - 80</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Input_Sensitivity">Input Sensitivity</h4><p dir="ltr">Stick Response Curve - Standard</p><p dir="ltr">Sensitivity Preset - Custom</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Horizontal Sensitivity - 450</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Vertical Sensitivity - 300</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Horizontal Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 50</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Vertical Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 50</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Turning Activation Time - 30</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Turn Delay - 0</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Horizontal Sensitivity - 200</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Vertical Sensitivity - 150</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Horizontal Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 20</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Vertical Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 20</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Turning Activation Time - 50</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Turn Delay - 0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Set Sensitivity Per Zoom - Off (You can turn this on and manually set different zooms for all your scope types, but the default setting works fine here.)</p><p dir="ltr">Sensitivity Transition Mode - ADS Transition</p><p dir="ltr">Scope Magnification Adapts Automatically - On</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Infantry Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Ground Vehicle Driver Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Aircraft Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Gunner Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Turret Locked While Vehicle Turning - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Controller Vibration - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Adaptive Triggers (PS5) - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Adaptive Trigger effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">He departs after 23 years and nearly 10 as the studio's head.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is departing the company after 23 years and nearly 10 as CEO. He is succeeded by Justin Truman, currently chief development officer and fellow Bungie veteran.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on the official Bungie website</a>, Parsons wrote:</p><blockquote>When I was asked to lead Bungie in 2015, my goal was to grow us into a studio capable of creating and sustaining iconic, generation-spanning entertainment. We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment. </blockquote><blockquote>Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders, and I am thrilled to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping into leadership as Bungie's new Studio Head. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Parsons has overseen Bungie during many turbulent years, first taking over as CEO in 2016 from Harold Ryan and overseeing its break from Activision in 2019. He was at the helm throughout many of the events catalogued in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">2021 expose of Bungie's internal work culture</a>. Though those we spoke to reported that Bungie had been toxic and hostile toward women in particular prior to Parsons taking charge, they also told IGN that he was frequently slow or reluctant to take action when issues were reported, or even seemed clueless as to how to reign in problem employees. Parsons apologized at the time, saying, "Our actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain. I apologize personally and on behalf of everyone at Bungie who I know feel a deep sense of empathy and sadness reading through these accounts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just months after our report, Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">was acquired by Sony for $3.7 billion</a>, ending the studio's flirtation with independence. As the acquistion settled in, concerns began to arise about Bungie's future. Destiny 2 was struggling, and upcoming game Marathon was still years away. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-hit-with-lay-offs-as-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon-are-reportedly-delayed">Bungie laid off roughly 100 individuals</a> and delayed Destiny 2's The Final Shape DLC, with Parsons taking responsibility for the layoffs. Developers told IGN at the time that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">atmosphere at Bungie was "soul-crushing"</a> as fears grew of a total Sony takeover of the company. In 2024, this was followed up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">even more layoffs</a>, impacting 220 people this time, despite The Final Shape's success. 155 people were also integrated from Bungie into Sony at this time. Troubles continued to rock the studio through 2024 and into 2025, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall">Marathon seeing a delay out of September of this year</a> to an unknown future date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's in this environment - Destiny 2 struggling, Marathon delayed, a smaller staff, and Sony looming, that Parsons departs the company. He leaves it to Justin Truman, who began at Bungie as a developer 15 years ago working on Destiny 1 and who has since worked his way up to chief development officer and now studio head.</p><blockquote>When we’re at our best – we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us. Something that I’ve learned, hopefully, overdelivers. </blockquote><blockquote>I’ve also been part of these efforts at Bungie when we’ve maybe not been at our best. When we’ve stumbled and realized through listening to our community that we had missed the mark. I know I’ve personally learned a lot over the years, as have all of us here, from those conversations. </blockquote><blockquote>I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them. </blockquote><blockquote>We are hard at work right now doing that – both with Marathon and Destiny. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Bungie's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bungie.net/post/3lwwqrfgiuy2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post</a>, Parsons is retiring and will seemingly not remain at the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has started testing another handheld-friendly addition to its Xbox app, allowing PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and even rival storefronts. A new “My apps” feature is being tested in the Xbox app for Windows 11, and it looks like another way to avoid having to launch the main Microsoft Store or hunt for downloads online if you’re on a gaming PC.</p><p>“My apps is a new tab within the Xbox PC app’s library that allows players to locate, view, and download third-party applications and most commonly used storefronts,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/21/available-for-xbox-insiders-get-to-the-games-faster-with-my-apps/">explains Devin Dhaliwal</a>, a product manager for Xbox experiences. “By consolidating gaming apps in one location, this feature supports the new aggregated gaming library, making it more straightforward to find, download, and launch games from multiple locations.”</p><p>Microsoft has already been adding Steam, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, and other PC games into to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">unified library inside its Xbox app</a>, but this my apps view will be useful on a handheld PC where you want to avoid using the Windows desktop interface as much as possible. “My apps enables players on an ROG Xbox Ally or other Windows 11 handhelds to more easily navigate between applications from the Xbox full screen experience,” says Dhaliwal.</p><p>I’ve briefly tested the My apps view today and it lists Battle.net, Chrome, and GOG Galaxy. I have Chrome and Battle.net installed, so it simply launches these apps, but with GOG Galaxy it tries to download and install the app all within the Xbox UI. I say try because it failed to install during my testing, but this is a beta so there are bound to be bugs.</p><p>Microsoft is testing this with a “tailored selection of apps” right now, and plans to expand support for additional apps over time. It’s an interesting move, particularly given Microsoft’s work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">merging the best bits of Windows and Xbox together</a> for the Xbox Ally handheld gaming PCs. Microsoft said last year that it wanted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">make the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and it’s sure trying to make that a reality.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the latest entry in our 'What I Do' series</a>, where we examine in detail just what it is, exactly, that individual workers do for a living in the video game industry.</p><p>Having recently spoken with<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a UX researcher</a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-age-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> age ratings guy</a> and<a href="https://aftermath.site/narrative-designer-job-description-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> narrative designer</a>, today we're interviewing Jason White, a Game Capture Director, which is a job that involves...well, I'll let Jason explain.</p><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us Jason! What, exactly, do you do for a living in the video game industry?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Jason White</strong>: So I am a Game Capture Director, which encompasses a lot of things, but in short: I capture and direct in-engine gameplay for video game trailers, which can either be straight gameplay or cinematic “freecam” angles of gameplay action.</p><p><strong><em>LP: OK, so how does that actually work? What does an average project look like?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: At the very start of a project, we will usually be sent a WIP build of the game so I can play through it as much as I can. Throughout this process, I’m taking notes of what’s genuinely fun, what areas look good, what combos or abilities or gameplay mechanics are fun and visually interesting, etc. We get some of this information in a marketing brief, but it’s usually pretty bare bones for our purposes ("3 new biomes!” and the like). So in addition to my own notes, and if this is a new game or new version of a game, I’ll also create a “What Does It Feel Like to Play” document. This document is shared with everyone else on our team (producers, writers, editor) who will not have the time to play through a game but still need to understand it from a player’s perspective.</p><p>Based off that, and what the client wants (usually the publisher, sometimes combo of publisher and developer), the writers will create a few different scripts and I’ll make adjustments for gameplay accuracy, what’s possible to capture within the build limitations, anything else relevant.</p><p>After the client selects the script, I’ll make a shot list of what we’re going to capture to tell the story of the script. We will also have an internal kick-off meeting for everyone on the project to throw out ideas to further refine the storytelling beats, any visual motifs we want to try, possible jokes (if the game/trailer is supposed to be funny), etc.</p><p>Somewhere in this build exploration, I will also find and test the different debug tools available to us. These can be as simple as the base debug camera (I use “freecam” and “debug camera” interchangeably) built into Unreal and whatever debug commands we can find ourselves, or as expansive as an entirely custom Imgui built by the devs that allow us to control camera functions, enable/adjust depth of field, spawn characters, change lighting, etc. Every game is different and figuring out what is possible within those parameters takes up a lot of time and problem solving in order to bend the game for consistent, effective, and beautiful virtual cinematography.</p><p>After all that prep, I finally start capturing. Depending on the game, this can either be a solo experience, or it can involve a second person occasionally playing the character while I control the cinematic camera, or it can involve multiple capture techs playing characters in “scenes.”</p><p>Once I’m done capturing for the day, or whenever I need to deliver footage to the editor, I hand that footage off to our Games Coordinator to ingest into our editorial pipeline. I’ll work with the editor throughout the entire process, giving notes and figuring out what other coverage is needed.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.buddha-jones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buddha Jones</a>, we like to make the V1 our ideal version, which usually takes some stronger creative swings than the client ultimately wants, and then we find a happy medium that we can all live with. Between the V1 and getting picture lock, I’ll go back to the game and either capture new stuff to address notes or recapture existing footage due to build changes/updates.</p><p>There are other aspects of my job, like smoothing out adjustments to our capture pipeline or training Capture Techs and supervising Capture Artists, that fall more into the management side of my job, but the above are my primary responsibilities when it comes to capturing for a video game trailer. I’ve also presented how our process is ideally supposed to go, there are plenty of instances in which schedules are truncated or changes are made mid stream and that presents its own challenges.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Perfect Dark - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofUi9DR9sc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong><em>LP: Given most people out there won't know most of that, what do you think might be some of the bigger misconceptions among the public about your field?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: I think the biggest misconception the general public has about my job is that there are more trailers made from vertical slices of video games than most people think. To clarify, a vertical slice is a representative demo of what the game <em>will be</em>. Or at least, what the developers are working toward at that point in their production schedule. Sure, certain things may be scripted that will eventually be dynamic, and there are more constraints than the final product will have, but a vertical slice is not a lie, nor would I ever consider a trailer made from one “fake.” They are a fairly common part of lengthy development cycles, especially ones with a lot of money behind them.</p><p>The best example of this was last year’s<a href="https://youtu.be/ofUi9DR9sc4?si=HHcxQZLsT2-gyu-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> trailer for <em>Perfect Dark</em></a> that I captured. I don’t think I need to recount the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-developer-says-eye-catching-2024-gameplay-demo-had-some-fakery-but-quite-a-lot-of-it-was-legit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire drama</a> around that, but the level designer clarified that situation pretty well. As the person who captured that game from the vertical slice, I agree with everything he said. And on a personal level, it broke my heart to see <em>Perfect Dark</em> get cancelled. I was a massive fan of Rare’s original game. Such a fan in fact that I asked a developer I knew at The Initiative to put a tiny slice of cheese in the demo for me to capture. I genuinely don’t know if anyone ever noticed, but it made me smile whenever I had to capture that playthrough for the umpteenth time.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Given you're so directly responsible for stuff that millions of people will see in a trailer, what are the coolest jobs you've ever got the chance to work on?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Pac-Man</em> in a single<a href="https://youtu.be/TecBZk01poo?si=pKIegpfnpm6JFO9r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Grounded</em> trailer</a>. But the thing I’m most proud of is actually the work I did on three <em>Babylon’s Fall </em>trailers (<a href="https://youtu.be/-zA-iGMgUqQ?si=8Sqkqr5mS5jnd6kW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA</a>,<a href="https://youtu.be/0tyQnO42TsQ?si=4wbUGd_LWNQ-x7o4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Combat 101</a>, and<a href="https://youtu.be/6eR9L_gHeak?si=KjBpJ8MucVNMxEAJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launch</a>). It may not have been the next <em>NieR</em>, to put it lightly, but Square Enix was so happy with our work on that campaign that we then got to make trailers for both <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> (<a href="https://youtu.be/wvunu2e29tc?si=l-F_KlrlBqpapmQa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revenge</a> and<a href="https://youtu.be/iaJ4VVFGIa8?si=kVfq0wPMRcuZ07R2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ascension</a>) and<a href="https://youtu.be/tUaWUyaeXhs?si=T7gQdvdSoVCrTxL_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, both of which are career highlights for me.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Before we wrap up, in an ideal world, what aspects of the job would you like to see improved? What would make your job easier?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: I would love longer schedules to make a trailer and specifically more time with the build before we start capturing. The truncating of schedules, and especially the delay in providing builds to capture teams, is what really sets us back and makes the job harder. When we have less time to explore, be creative, and actually capture, we could end up with footage and trailers that are more generic and less compelling. No one wants that. Future clients: please give us your build as early as possible and let us cook. I promise, your game will thank us!</p><p><strong><em>LP: Thanks Jason!</em></strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker]]></content:encoded>

And in recent years, that same universe has started to trickle over into the world of tabletop games. One such experience is a collaboration with Brotherwise Games called Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game, which is currently discounted on Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mistborn board game pulls from Era 1 of the Mistborn book series. These were some of the first Brandon Sanderson books I ever read and are, in my opinion, the best entrypoint into The Cosmere as a whole. If you're a fan of both the books <em>and </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deckbuilding games</a>, I definitely recommend checking out this crossover board game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game Is on Sale at Amazon</h2><div catalogid="03f4581e-8b45-41ac-ae43-398a90ca5d3b" id="226306"><div id="226306" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mistborn board game was designed by John D. Clair and published by Brotherwise Games. The game itself pulls directly from its source material, and players will have to burn and flare metals as they battle each other or the Lord Ruler throughout play. Like any standard deckbuilding game, everyone will begin with a weaker deck of cards and slowly add new ones to their hand throughout the game. It's designed for up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> total, but can also be played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> if you prefer that route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The current discount on Amazon drops the price down to $39.17, which is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DK3ZZFVM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest price we've ever seen</a> for this game.

"We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about – and in early stages of planning – some bigger things. One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time. There's been some changes in <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/warner-bros-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Warner Bros.

Although WB Games has managed to deliver successful comic book-based video games like the Injustice series and Batman Arkham series, DC gaming still has some work to do if it wants to make up lost ground.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's been some slight movement on different things.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunn teases things are finally in motion at WB Games but declined to share what kind of DC projects fans can expect to see in the future.

Safran says they’ve been hands-on when it comes to new projects at studios like Injustice studio NetherRealm and Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady as they steer DC in a fresh direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages,” Gunn added at the time. “We talk about those. We talk about when they're talking about what the story might be, we say, ‘Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,’ and help to deal with that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be some time before a new vision for WB Games comes to fruition.
