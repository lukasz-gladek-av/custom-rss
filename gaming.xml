			<p>As proudly individual as each game in the SteamWorld series is, sometimes you just want a good old fashioned sequel, a game that goes back over familiar ground and tries to make things bigger and better. With close to a decade since the original, it feels like high time that Thunderful return to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/21/steamworld-heist-review/">one of their most popular entries</a> with the side-scrolling turn-based action of SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh7iOX-TCjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Where the first Heist was a space-faring jaunt in junky steampunk ships, SteamWorld Heist 2 throws you right into the midsts of a great ecological crisis threatening its watery world where boats and subs are the order of the day. Oh sure, it’s already just a fragment of a planet hurtling through space, but where now Steambots are struggling to find clean water, afflicting them with Rust, and there’s literally just one ship’s captain who’s got a hope of unpicking the mystery of what’s going on. Captain Leeway steps into the breach – no, not “Krakenbane” herself, but her son – or at least, he would do, but at the start of the game, he’s very much down on his luck, his inherited submarine having been confiscated and having lost his good arm for shooting.</p>


<p>So the game opens with an introductory mission with his last two trusty crew members embarking on an audacious mission to steal his submarine back, facing off against the Dieselbots of the Royal Navy to do so. This personal task successfully completed, and Captain Leeway is thrust into continuing his campaign against the Dieselbots, the mysteriously bony Rattlers, and trying to get to the bottom of what’s giving all the Steambots a nasty case of Rust – hint, it’s the salty water.</p>


<p>Just as before, SteamWorld Heist 2 is XCOM given the Flat Stanley treatment. Instead of commanding your handful of crew members through 3D spaces, you’ve got a side-on view of every combat location. It’s a nice and permissive kind of turn-based tactical battling though, letting you aim and shoot through the cover you’re hiding behind and past allies, through thinner gantry-like flooring, and using ricochets to hit enemies who are in cover themselves. And instead of aim being a percentage based roll of the dice, it’s more like Worms in that you have to line up your shot and then time it with the natural sway of the weapon – It helps greatly that one of your first characters is a sniper, which gives you a laser sight that even shows bullet bounces.</p>
<p>SteamWorld Heist 2 comes with a new Jobs system for classes, though, all dependent on which primary weapon is equipped. There’s no limitations to Job switching, and as soon as you’ve gained a level in one role, those skills can then be unlocked for another role by assigning Cogs. The Flanker and Brawler are easy to synergise, giving a melee character much enhanced movement, while you could turn your Sniper into a backline support with cover building and team healing abilities from the Engineer.</p>

<p>The deeper you get into the game, the more weapons and gear that you’ll earn, and there’s further avenues to upgrade your characters and roster as a whole. Higher levelled weapons will dish out more damage, and there’s also Epic weapons with special effects, like a sniper with electric discharge, or a crossbow for the Reaper instead of an SMG.</p>
<p>There’s some great nuances to explore here, especially as you need to make the very most of every advantage your get on higher difficulties, and there’s missions that will hew toward one style of play or another. Compared to the original, level layouts are now fixed, but with randomised cover and enemies, so you have much more repeatable experiences than the more broadly procedural levels of before. That leads to missions where, confronted with countless Rattler totems and a secondary objective not to destroy any of them yourself, you’ll need precision and minimal ricochets –&nbsp;it took me a few tries. And then there’s just stages that are designed for varying team sizes.</p>
<p>Another big area that SteamWorld Heist 2 improves upon is with everything between missions. Yes, there’s downtime at safe havens and bars, where you can rest up to get to the next day, shop for better gear and chat to NPCs –&nbsp;you’ll also get the luxurious vocal harmonies of the original songs by Steam Powered Giraffe stuck in your head – but then there’s the neat open world to sail around to get to each location, and enemy ships to battle.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="A Life of Un-Delightment by Steam Powered Giraffe (Official Music Video) SteamWorld Heist II" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cGwq9r51cc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The submarine is pretty weak to start off, but with weapon mounts to the side, front and top, as well as more unlockable slots for upgrades, it can become a pretty fierce little thing, capable of taking on enemy capital ships. That’s especially true because of how agile it is with responsive arcade handling, not to mention the upgrade to let you dive beneath the surface –&nbsp;where you’ll come to find other subs and mines. It’s a fun diversion between the sometimes gruelling battles.</p>
<p>By default, the game comes at you with the Experienced difficulty level, and through the opening regions, that’s pretty straightforward to handle. However, the Rattlers can really swarm you and levels often have enemy spawn points that make you scramble and rush just to survive –&nbsp;by the third or fourth region the difficulty had really stepped up a few notches. Thankfully the difficulty is customisable beyond the fistful of presets, and a checkpoint system mid-level lets you roll back up to two turns if you want to slap yourself for a dumb move or fluffed shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/armor-games-publishing-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reports are emerging of staff at Armor Games' publishing division being laid off, and some staff are suggesting that the entire publishing department of the company has been let go.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/michelle_lega/status/1818708889627697485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, senior producer Michelle Lega said yesterday that she had been laid off and that the studio's team <a href="https://x.com/michelle_lega/status/1818710369294336177" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would "all be looking for jobs soon"</a>, suggesting that nobody at Armor Games has kept their jobs in this latest layoff wave.</p>
<p>Several <a href="https://x.com/bearskvlls/status/1818722008739586413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> Armor Games <a href="https://x.com/kenzie__du/status/1818943712300609839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employees</a> have corroborated the reports of layoffs, suggesting that at the very least, the studio has undergone a fairly severe "restructuring", as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">Humble Games would likely call it</a>.</p>

<p>It's not exactly clear what's going to happen to Armor Games' published titles, which include the likes of cozy woodland management sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bear-and-breakfast"><em>Bear and Breakfast</em></a>, escape room adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tartarus-key-review"><em>The Tartarus Key</em></a>, and black-and-white RPG&nbsp;<em>In Stars and Time</em>, among others.</p>
<p>Assuming that Armor Games' publishing department has shut down, it wouldn't be the first indie studio to undergo mass layoffs in the last few months. There's the aforementioned Humble Games, of course, which has supposedly completely shut down, and other indie companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs"><em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs"><em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>studio Bossa</a> have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next in the case of Armor Games. We've reached out to Armor for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

            <p>Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call Of Duty: Warzone</a>. It got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pour-one-out-for-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-which-is-shutting-down-in-september">shut down last year</a> as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Open-source assets like Caldera play a vital role in the advancement of artificial intelligence," says <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-releases-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-data-set">a post by Activision</a> accompanying the map files. "By providing a rich, diverse environment, we facilitate the training of AI models, enhancing the industry’s understanding of complex geometries and interactions. This can lead to more intelligent systems, paving the way for the next generation of gaming and simulation technologies." </p>
<p>It is easy to read this and assume it is Activision's way of saying: hey, level designers, your job is also unsafe. The data they're releasing also includes records of the paths players took across the island. That information is often critical to designers of these sorts of huge landmasses. </p>
<p>Whatever the company's motivation, it is certain to elicit mixed emotions in game development circles. Releasing something as open source is often viewed as a virtuous act in software development, since it has benefits that stretch beyond profit margins. But suggesting that your open source offering be used to train machinery that replaces paid human craft and artistry somewhat poisons that virtue. Activision don't seem to be bothered though.</p>
<p>"In an era where AI training and the evolution of authoring tools are pivotal, the availability of production-proven maps is crucial," they say. "This is about collaborating with the gaming and research community to build a foundation for responsible innovation and learning across the industry."</p>
<p>Maybe I'm worrying too much. Yes, we can probably assume Activision would like to further automate processes that involve humans, but it's not certain the data will be as useful to AI researchers as they might hope. For example, their enthusiasm comes at a moment when investors are starting to realise that maybe all those billions of dollars pumped into artificial intelligence <a href="https://futurism.com/investors-concerned-ai-making-money">won't see any profitable result</a>. "Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful," said one Goldman Sach's analyst.</p>
<p>The map data for Caldera is <a href="https://github.com/Activision/caldera">available on Github</a>, and is designed to be opened and viewed with a tool called <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usdview/latest/quickstart.html">USDView</a>. Ignoring the AI-motivated stink, I do think it's cool for normal humans with some technical nouse to be able to fly around maps like this, drinking everything in with nostalgia. I've done the same thing to old Halo 2 maps and get a buzz from peeking around on browser-based toys like <a href="https://noclip.website/">noclip.website</a>, which let you explore maps from Dark Souls, Banjo-Kazooie, and Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Shooty sequel Warzone 2 is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">best battle royale games</a>, so it's likely someone out there will get the same curious joy from flying around Caldera.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2D action adventure RPG landed right as the Dark Souls series was making its mark but carved its own identity before the word "soulslike" was ever uttered. Creator and Heart Machine founder Alx Preston envisioned an ancient and ruinous world with a hero whose body is struggling under the weight of a disease </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-haunting-real-life-disease-that-inspired-i-hyper-light-drifter-i-">not unlike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the one Preston lives with. But it's not strictly a world of body horror—its dungeons and overworld mix light and dark colors inspired by a 16-bit color palette.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game seemed so inseparable from that SNES-era-style aesthetic, so it was something of a surprise when Heart Machine revealed the existence of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Hyper Light Breaker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a third-person roguelike that can be played solo or cooperatively, which is on its way to an Early Access release. What does it mean to translate an aesthetic from 2D to 3D, especially in the world of the Hyper Light series?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to art director Danny Moll and principal character artist John DeRiggi, it's all about carefully defining what made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> such a striking game, then recreating those concepts with 3D techniques.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which ones? Have a look.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hyper Light Breaker"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span> doesn't need your fancy textures</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand the aesthetic of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you should take a quick look at Heart Machine's previous game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solar Ash</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That game was the studio's jump from 2D into 3D, and taught the team a lot about how to create vibrant locales in beautiful locations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moll explained that studying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solar Ash </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">taught him what Preston valued in 3D art direction; impressionistic environments and character models with bold colors and very simple textures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you move into a 3D space, you start having to restrict data and details more intentionally," he said. That led to the team using Blender's "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html">Decimate Modifier</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" and embracing "polygonal qualities" to create that game's aesthetic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Preston told Moll that he wanted to "slightly" increase the intricacy on objects so that if players got close, they'd see some detail. This creates a space where Heart Machine can bring over the worldbuilding style of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with its ancient ruins of a high-tech civilization sitting in the middle of a "post-post apocalyptic" world. The former is an environment defined by rigid and "blocky" geometry, moody purples and reds, and runic symbols, while the latter has softer, pastoral vibes and colors of green, orange, and pink.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the character design side (and characters are very important here, since players will have the option to select one of several "Breakers"), DeRiggi explained that the team took inspiration from 2D cell-based animation like the kind used in classic TV shows. Here, the detailing was dedicated on elements like the Breakers' costuming and drapery—but still kept in check, to contrast with the highly-detailed PBR rendering used in higher-fidelity games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We really wanted to push on selling the 'lower-frequency' hero, [focusing] on elements of the characters that made them pop and reach from a distance," said DeRiggi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breaker </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">introduces another new challenge for Heart Machine: the live service-adjacent nature of Early Access. Shipping the game won't be a one-and-done process, it'll be evolving in response to player feedback and design shifts throughout the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does the art team intend to handle that challenge? "Flow charts," Moll said. He described a "big" flow chart that maps out the design process—how designers or artists block out a level, iterate, then shift it to the art side, then what to do if the level needs more feedback, etc. etc.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the fun things about working on this kind of game is that there's an indefinite amount of variety that we can add, so we're always brainstorming new ideas and queuing things," he said. "Then when it comes to Early Access, we have our our plans about what we want to make, but we are also preparing to be flexible to player feedback."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He credited lead producer Michael Clark, who has experience on live service games, with building internal processes that could keep content flowing smoothly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another self-imposed limitation that helps this process, DeRiggi added, is that when it comes to the visual design of the Breakers, they're not designed to be visually customizable, a feature found in other live service or roguelike games. "It's a personal world for [Preston]. So he wasn't looking for there to be this whole wide range of customization across the the board of characters," he said.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means he and his colleagues can focus on improving the looks of the revealed characters (mostly through small tweaks, as their designs are pretty much locked-in), and spin up new ones inspired by community feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combine those strategies with some "highly modular" environment kits, and the Hyper Light series is now ready to roll into a new era of game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Heart Machine is a benchmark of how indie developers survive and thrive">Heart Machine is a benchmark of how indie developers survive and thrive</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through hard work and creativity, Preston and his peers have kept one of the most eye-catching indie studios of the 2010s alive even as the game industry struggles through financial crisis and COVID-19. Its continued success tells us a lot about how studios are making the jump through different eras of development.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one major beneficiary of the Kickstarter era before games began to struggle on that platform. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solar Ash</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brought it into a partnership with Annapurna Interactive, a publisher that's brought indie games to bigger audiences through a mix of patience and film industry experience.

From roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-deckbuilding-game-review-force-is-strong-with-this-one">card games</a> to the fantastic miniatures games by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/star-wars-shatterpoint-first-impressions">Atomic Mass Games</a>,&nbsp;players can easily recreate epic <em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;battles. It's easy to throw the Star Wars name on a product, but harder to embed the theme in the mechanics and make it feel like a <em>Star Wars</em> game. In this article, we're going to look at the all-new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, a fast-paced card drafting game. Does it feel like a <em>Star Wars</em> game, or is it just a skin over the mechanics?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-3.jpg?itok=PpY-LiBb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-3.jpg?itok=OYlEEb7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> features some of the most famous bounty hunters across the <em>Star Wars</em> Universe.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does Star Wars Bounty Hunters Play?</h2>
<p>In<i> Star Wars Bounty Hunters,</i> players draw a hand of 5 cards, choose one to play, and then pass the rest to the player on their left, and receive 4 cards from the player on their right, they then draw another card, play a card, and pass again. Play continues this way until 4 contracts are won, and then scores from across a range of areas are totaled up and the winner is declared.</p>
<p>The cards that drive the game are drawn from 4 different decks:</p>
<ul><li>Target - Target cards are the core of <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, they're made up of famous characters from across the <em>Star Wars</em> Universe, and they contain 3 different shield values that must be beaten to collect the bounty, and the points they earn if scored.</li>
<li>Bounty Hunters&nbsp;- Bounty Hunters can be played for free against contracts (and you can also play them without a contract to prepare for one) and they have attack values that are used to defeat the shields on Target cards. Bounty Hunters also contain a negative score, which is deducted&nbsp;from the contract points scored.</li>
<li>Contract - Contract cards contain combinations of Target cards that can earn you bonuses if scored together.</li>
<li>Jawa Market - This deck contains droids, who work similarly to Bounty Hunters (they just need to be paid for rather than being free to play), and Crates, which earn points at the end of the game, and bonus points for the player with the most crates.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-2.jpg?itok=EloEAjB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-2.jpg?itok=JybnECTx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> features 4 types of cards, from left to right Targets, Contracts, Bounty Hunters and Droids (from the Jawa Deck).</figcaption></figure><p>Each turn in <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> happens simultaneously, with players receiving their cards, drawing, and then playing. This format keeps games fast-flowing but can be stalled if players start to analyze every single option. The four decks create a weird dynamic that if you see a card you want in the hand already, you don't want to draw a possibly great card from the Jawa Market or Target Deck, and would rather load the hand with Bounty Hunter cards (which although are free to play, tend to be worse than droids because of the negative points they have) or contract cards (which generally aren't worth the extra effort of trying to score until later in the game). But then if you do fill the hand with duff cards, you will still get that hand back eventually when it passes back to you.</p>
<p>To get around this, we tried a few variations of the rules. Passing the cards face down and drawing before seeing, which is too random as to which deck to draw from, and if you shuffle all the cards into a single deck, it also creates too random an element to be enjoyable. We also tried shuffling the contract and target cards into a single deck, and the bounty hunters and Jawa deck into a single deck, which created an element of randomness, but also meant that you weren't deliberately stuffing the hand you passed to your opponent.</p>
<p>A better way to fix it would have been to make the contract cards more worthwhile, the extra couple of points they give you are rarely worth the effort, and buffing the Bounty Hunters slightly (the stars of the game's title) to balance them better against the droids which even though they cost to play, are usually equal to or better than the Bounty Hunters, but without the negative points modifier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-4.jpg?itok=qmwBqzfh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-4.jpg?itok=dSXmZ1mc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the famous faces you will chase down in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's The Theme Like In Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>Other than the art on the cards, and the rough power across the cards (Boba Fett has great stats and Grogu earns you very high points for capturing the target), the theme is a skin across the mechanics. It could be anything and it would still work.</p>
<p>If you're really into <em>Star Wars</em>, then there's something to be said about using famous bounty hunters and droids to chase down the good guys of the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, but if you want some depth to your theme, then <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> is very light.</p>
<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>The theme for <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> is just a skin over the mechanics, which could be forgiven if it was an incredible drafting game, but the balance between the 4 card types feels off, which then throws off the drafting element of it. This also complicates it for younger players, which the artwork looks like it's aimed at, as not understanding the complexities of the different card types and playing tactically, mean that it can be a frustrating game for younger players.</p>
<p>I can't help thinking that if it was a single deck, with each card having a few options for use, that would have worked better, but in its current state it just felt strange to play. In the test games we played, we usually ended up with hands full of cards you didn't want, and just alternating between burning a card for credits, and hoping to draw a droid the next turn.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>If you really really love <em>Star Wars</em>, then you will be able to get behind <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, but for the rest, it's neither a great tactical drafting game, nor a quick fun-filled easy game, and treads a weird line between the 2 types, while not having the great bits of either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/steamworld-heist-ii-review-underwhelming-haul-o-loot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard not to appreciate what <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/thunderful-publishing">Thunderful</a> is doing with their ever-expanding <em>SteamWorld</em> franchise. Spanning across multiple genres are titles that take risks and try something new, all featuring a unique world full of robots running on steam. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, then, is just as charming and polished as the rest, but it didn't click with me as well as it should.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is a game made with people like me in mind -- I'm a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> fiend, but this genre thrives on variation, and that is something <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>doesn't do well. The experience is well-crafted, no doubt, but its gameplay does little to evolve over the course of its 25+ hour adventure.</p>
<p>Players take the role of Captain Leeway, a one-armed Steambot living in the shadow of his much more famous mother. He's trying to carve a legend for himself and solidify his place in this world of steam. Trading the sci-fi aesthetic of the first <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> for a pirate adventure, you'll sail the high seas and fight against other factions of bots along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-guns.jpg?itok=0aYurGTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-guns.jpg?itok=8K9lR-Ph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remember to ricochet.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> -- A Unique Take on Strategy Games</h2>
<p>As they say, variety is the spice of life. Up front, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> certainly appears to have a great deal of customization and depth, even more so than its predecessor. There are several classes with unique abilities, plenty of gear, different crew members, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, the core gameplay is itself still as fun as the original. The side-scrolling nature of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> helps it stand out among other turn-based tactics games. Crew members are, for the most part, armed with guns and the gimmick of making bullets ricochet all around is entertaining. You can pull some seriously cool shots here, but that's also no different than the original game.</p>
<p>At first glance, it does come off as a bit of a palate swap, and I can't lie, I do miss the sci-fi, spaceship theme of the original. Even still, <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> <em>II </em>tries to mix things up by adding a variety of different sea-based environments and forts to capture. But again, try as Thunderful might to innovate, after several hours of gameplay, I felt like I saw everything the game had to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-units.jpg?itok=lHVDmV0f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-units.jpg?itok=aLcHg4So 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Six classes isn't a lot, and there aren't all that many abilities that stand out, either.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Certain Lack of Depth in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></h2>
<p>Classes have linear skill trees and you can even combine two or more classes together. Characters level up as they complete missions and advance the skill tree. You can allocate a resource called cogs to activate certain talents on the tree.</p>
<p>You theoretically have the ability to create a very diverse character, but I never felt like I was able to achieve that. XP gain was pretty slow, so at best I combined two classes together. Now, classes are dictated by weapon type, but even with mix-and-matched talents and weapons, characters didn't feel all that different.</p>
<p>For a loose comparison, other tactics games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fire-emblem-engage-review"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a> have dozens of classes, but in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, you're only dealing with a handful. You can only have so much variation and, though I admire the game's attempt to create a flexible class system, it just didn't resonate with me. Perhaps the best way to put it is an overall lack of depth in a game that would benefit from more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-boss.jpg?itok=RB3grrBx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-boss.jpg?itok=qvMz6Xzh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss battles are few and far between in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While you can equip weapons that behave slightly different from one another, it's still not enough. Abilities specific to certain crew members, like this powerful beam called Eldritch Blast on one particular bot, is all well and good, but have longer cooldowns so you're using the same class-based abilities much more often.</p>
<p>There are several factions in the game, each a bit different from the other, but they are used in so many missions it all feels quite samey after a while. Level objectives, too, try to add unique criteria so you can get a better score and earn extra loot, but again, they don't vary all that much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat-2_0.jpg?itok=xrUB8z20 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat-2_0.jpg?itok=uFCEuRlo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Those skeletons are robots, I assure you.</figcaption></figure><h2>RNG and Alarms, Oh Boy</h2>
<p>Most of the time, you're tasked with collecting a set amount of loot before a time limit expires, or eliminate an enemy in a super specific way. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> does get tiring with these time limits, <em>especially</em> with alarms. After a bit, reinforcements are called by these alarms and, like the first game, they do <em>not</em> end.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of enemy is thrown at you during these alarms, and it can get chaotic very fast. Getting overwhelmed is a real possibility, and this exacerbates the feeling of repetition. There's no real nuance to throwing droves of endless enemies at you, especially when they all behave the same.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat.jpg?itok=3pm-1TG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat.jpg?itok=l6sfgeJV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, point-blank is the way to go.</figcaption></figure><p>More to that point, these spawns from alarms are also completely RNG-based. You're able to go back two turns in a given level at any time. This is often used to rectify mistakes you make. What ends up happening is these spawns from alarms are totally different when you go back two turns. You can end up with way less enemies and even less powerful ones, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The problems I had with <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>'s depth are more a matter of taste, but RNG is a real issue here. It's really quite baffling to go from a turn spawning several beefy, powerful enemies, only to use the reload option (that you're encouraged to use, by the way) and end up fighting one puny enemy instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-naval-combat.jpg?itok=WCv2VeXV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-naval-combat.jpg?itok=b2QI85He 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David versus Goliath.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Choice of Controls</h2>
<p>Other than that, the other glaring issue here is using mouse and keyboard versus controller. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>'s weird keybinding for actions and abilities on mouse and keyboard are rectified when using a controller. But, as you have to manually aim characters' guns, it is much more efficient and precise to use mouse.</p>
<p>As a result, I ended up incorporating this hybrid type of play, using my controller for most abilities except when I needed to aim. Missing a shot can be a big deal, so it behooves you to be as precise as possible to land those headshots and ricochet bullets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-submarine.jpg?itok=6bR2wLOM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-submarine.jpg?itok=-C82TXwY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what's in the depths of this sea?</figcaption></figure><p>I touched on this in my preview from Summer Game Fest, but there's also an overworld component through which you control and navigate your own ship. It's secondary to actual tactical combat with your bots, but it adds a bit more variety to break up the monotony. You can position your ship and it shoots weapons automatically, so it's not the most "active" form of gameplay.</p>
<p>It's decently fun to use the ship and later on, it becomes a submarine, though it hardly changes the gameplay much. It's the means by which you travel mission to mission, but by the end of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, I would have much preferred fast travel or something to make it less of a bother to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-dialogue-2.jpg?itok=DCNgsHqA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-dialogue-2.jpg?itok=DUyAKJH7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's alright, this robbery is for the people.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>My thoughts on the story are brief because I couldn't get hooked by the narrative. I didn't care for any of the characters or their motivations, which is a shame. It's not that it isn't well-written -- it is perfectly fine as is -- but it's not particularly interesting, either. There's humor here and there, but it didn't click. Though, if you are a fan of <em>SteamWorld</em> lore, I'm sure it'll tickle you fancy.</p>
<p>It actually hurts to be critical towards<em> SteamWorld Heist II,</em> as this is a clear labor of love. And it's not a bad game either -- not by a long shot -- it just has noticeable flaws that hindered it from being great. Though it feels far too long for its own good and lacks much nuance in its gameplay, <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>might just tickle your fancy.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Despite SteamWorld Heist II's shortcomings, it's a fun and polished game. It does, however, suffer from repetition and lack of depth, so it feels like you've seen all it has to offer after a few hours. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

By June 2022, the greenlight for the second season was confirmed. And we now know it’ll air December 26, 2024.</p><p>The next run is likely to focus more on the mysterious Front Man and his police officer brother, while digging into the background of the so-called “salesman character.” In 2022 we also learned that Lee Jung-jae would reprise his lead role, alongside Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo and Wi Ha-joon, with the addition of superstar Park Sung-hoon (<em>The Glory</em>, <em>Queen of Tears</em>) among others. Skip forward two rather quiet years, and now we finally have a teaser trailer!</p><p>The teaser shows contestants running down a competition-size running track, while observed by familiar <em>Squid Game</em> guards, as players fall to the ground (and knowing this show, are probably dead). Then, right at the end, it reveals there will be a third and final season in 2025.</p><p>I’m guessing, but I’d assume these would have to be being made back-to-back, given the <em>enormous</em> lead time on premium shows like these for streaming networks.

It’d also seem odd to strike sets between filming seasons, given the timeframe.</p><p>So, we only need to wait for Christmas to enjoy another round of gruesome capitalistic horror. And then the next day, season two of <em>Squid Game </em>will stream.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40047/until-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB site</a>, the anticipated new version of Until Dawn coming PC and PlayStation 5 now has a rating and corresponding summary.</p>



<p>Naturally, the survival horror classic Until Dawn earned another M rating, since its gameplay always featured “depictions of intense violence and/or gore.” </p>



<p>The ESRB rating reinforces that Until Dawn’s new release is still on track. It may even arrive sooner than expected, though that’s only speculation.</p>



<p>PlayStation most recently teased the rebuilt version from Ballistic Moon during its latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> in May 2024. The current release window for the game is Fall 2024, but it still doesn’t have a concrete release date.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Developer Supermassive Games released the original Until Dawn in 2015. The cinematic, narrative-driven horror game emphasizes player decisions. It also featured some Hollywood actors, such as Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, the rebuilt version of Until Dawn coming to PC will include Unreal Engine visuals and new content. </p>



<p>That includes “collectibles, all-new environments to investigate, and re-cut narrative sequences.” There will also be a third-person camera and other quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>In January 2024, PlayStation Productions and Screen Gems also confirmed that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn movie adaptation</a> is also in the works. David F. Sandberg, known for Annabelle: Creation and the DCEU’s Shazam films, is attached to direct.</p>

                <p>August has arrived, and this month, Prime Gaming members can grab an impressive number of PC games. As part of the Prime subscription service, these games will be made available in several weekly waves, and subscribers can look forward to some Steampunk robot adventures, archeological adventures with Lara Croft, and more. Once you claim the free games from Prime Gaming, they are yours to keep forever--even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and score some great freebies.</p><p>Available now, you can add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/steamworld-heist-review/1900-6416338/" data-ref-id="1900-6416338">SteamWorld Heist</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review/1900-6416497/" data-ref-id="1900-6416497">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>, and a few Tomb Raider games to your collection. SteamWorld Heist has a sequel out this month, so if you're looking to experience the original capers of a steam-driven pirate crew as they engage in tactical shootouts, then this game has you covered. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided isn't as good as 2010's Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but it's still a solid stealth-action game where you uncover a global conspiracy and make strange alliances. Since this is a GOG version of the game, you're getting it DRM-free version and with an extra in-game mission to enjoy.</p><p>The week closes out with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation/" data-ref-id="5000-280">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-chronicles/" data-ref-id="5000-2857">Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness/" data-ref-id="5000-3292">The Angel of Darkness</a>--old-school Lara Croft games that were released in the early- and mid-2000s. These were the final mainline games developed by Core Design, as publisher Eidos Interactive handed the franchise over to Crystal Dynamics following the poor critical reception of The Angel of Darkness.</p><p>Starting August 8, there are some more great games to grab. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/loop-hero-review/1900-6417656/" data-ref-id="1900-6417656">Loop Hero</a> is a complicated but engaging deckbuilding game and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/trek-to-yomi-review-one-samurai/1900-6417874/" data-ref-id="1900-6417874">Trek to Yomi</a> is a fascinating samurai tale.

You play as a traveling salesman making his way through an exceedingly strange town as you navigate a variety of platforming challenges.</p><hr><h2 id="h99257"><a id=""></a><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> - August 1</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows</p><p>There are bounties that need huntin’ in the Galaxy. In this remaster of the 2002 action-adventure game, you’ll play as legendary <em>Star Wars</em> bounty hunter Jango Fett in his quest to hunt down a notorious Jedi.</p><hr><h2 id="h99258"><a id=""></a><em>The Mortuary Assistant: Definitive Edition </em>- August 2</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows</p><p>Disappointed you didn’t get to realize your teenage fantasy of becoming a mortician? No worries, <em>Mortuary Assistant: Definitive Edition </em>lets you live out your dreams of cataloging dead bodies and, uh, surviving untold horrors like bodies rising from tables and creepy shadow girls crawling out of mirrors. They teach you all about such things in mortuary school, I’m told. </p><hr><h2 id="h99259"><a id=""></a><em>World of Goo 2</em> - August 2</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch, Windows, macOS, Linux</p><p>2008’s gooey puzzle game <em>World of Goo</em> is finally getting a sequel! Arriving on Switch, Windows, macOS, and Linux, the follow-up to the acclaimed puzzler was developed by the same team as the original. </p><hr><h2 id="h99260"><a id=""></a>Creatures of Ava - August 7</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p>11 bit studios’ <em>Creatures of Ava</em> tasks you with preserving life on an alien planet in the face of a rampant infection that’s destroying the local ecosystem. If you’ve been looking for a game that challenges you with saving wildlife instead of ravaging it, it might be worth checking this one out when it arrives on August 7, 2024.</p><hr><h2 id="h99261"><a id=""></a><em>Cat Quest 3</em> - August 8</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows</p><p>The Purribean calls! It’s once again time to assume the role of the cutest little pirate ever when <em>Cat Quest 3</em> arrives on August 8.</p><hr><h2 id="h99262"><a id=""></a><em>Steamworld Heist 2</em> - August 8</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows </p><p><em>Steamworld Heist 2</em> is a side-scrolling, turn-based strategy game in which you’re tasked with lining up the perfect shot on your foes both directly and via clever ricochet trick shots. It’s also got a whole “what if pirates but robots” vibe going on that’s pretty neat-looking.</p><hr><h2 id="h99263"><a id=""></a><em>The Crush House </em>- August 9</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows</p><p><em>The Crush House</em> has you producing a 1990s-style reality TV show. You’ll have to film couples doing all manner of…well, interesting if not disturbing things, like saying they wish someone could “glue our mouths together in our sleep.” This one certainly seems a little odd. Hopefully in a good way though? </p><hr><h2 id="h99264"><a id=""></a><em>Sam &amp; Max: The Devil’s Playhouse (Remastered) </em>- August 14</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Windows</p><p>If the sight of Sam and Max doesn’t fill you with joy…maybe you should get a new therapist. The loveable duo of freelance police return in a remaster of <em>The Devil’s Playhouse</em> available for PS5 and Windows.</p><hr><h2 id="h99265"><a id=""></a><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> - August 20</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p>How is <em>Black Myth</em> not out yet? Originally revealed in 2020, this action role-playing game looks set to deliver visceral combat against wild-looking (and sometimes gross) enemies.</p><hr><h2 id="h99266"><a id=""></a><em>Dustborn</em> - August 20</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p><em>Dustborn</em> imagines what it’s like to try and traverse against a dangerous landscape corrupted by erroneous misinformation that’s tearing people apart. A narrative-heavy single-player experience, characters fight by using literal words as their weapons in an effort to survive the brutal landscape of an alternate-history America.</p><hr><h2 id="h99267"><a id=""></a><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> - August 22</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows</p><p>One of the longest-running and most celebrated MMOs of all time grows larger still with <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>. This latest expansion kicks off a new narrative arc as the first of a trilogy of expansions.

<p>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, the upcoming flight-based, online multiplayer title based on JK Rowling’s iconic franchise, will hit stores on September 3, 2024. Prior to the release, the developers have provided details on the game’s various game modes, such as Career Mode, Multiplayer, and Exhibition Mode. Learn more information below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that all Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions matches will follow a 6v6 format, with “bots filling out at least three roles per team.” If players approach the game solo, they can swap between any of the six players from their team at any time.</p>

<h2 id="h-harry-potter-quidditch-champions-career-mode">Harry Potter Quidditch Champions Career Mode</h2>



<p>Embark on a thrilling journey with the Career Mode in Harry Potter Quidditch Champions. Compete in 4 Championship cups, solo or with up to 2 friends. The first cup, the Burrow Cup, is your stepping stone, where you’ll get the hang of introductory flight and position training. Next, represent your house in the Hogwarts House Quidditch Cup. The third cup is shrouded in mystery, adding an element of surprise, while the fourth and final cup, the Quidditch World Cup, promises an exhilarating finale.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-multiplayer-mode">Multiplayer Mode</h2>



<p>When playing multiplayer in Harry Potter Quidditch Champions, players can choose between these combinations of roles: Chaser/Keeper, Chaser/Beater, or Chaser/Seeker. Unlike the solo mode, players can only swap between their chosen two positions during a match, and the bot will control the remaining position. In this game mode, players can either party up with up to 2 more friends, select their preferred roles before matchmaking or even choose ‘Any Role’ to get a spot faster.</p>

<p>The final game mode revealed for Harry Potter Quidditch Champions is Exhibition Mode.

			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the PC games that will join NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform throughout August. Chief among them is, of course, Star Wars Outlaws. It's not much of a surprise, given that Ubisoft has supported GeForce NOW for years, but it's still great to get official confirmation.</p>
<p>GFN subscribers at the Ultimate tier will be able to take advantage of all the NVIDIA features implemented in the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction) and ray-traced effects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination</a> and RTGI (Global Illumination). Ubisoft Massive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the official PC system requirements for Star Wars Outlaws, which are predictably rather heavy, making GeForce NOW an enticing prospect.</p>
<p>The other big August release on NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform is Visions of Mana, the action RPG due later this month. You can already check out a free <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-demo-out-now-on-pc-playstation-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> (although not via GFN).</p>

<p>As spotted by fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/">via Red</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">d</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/">it</a>, the updated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cabuco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn page</a> for veteran art director Daniel Cabuco reveals that Obsidian is apparently working on another unannounced title.</p>



<p>Cabuco’s profile now lists their new position as “Art Director on unannounced title” at Obsidian, dated for July 2024. However, there were no further details about the nature of the project itself.</p>



<p>Developer Obsidian previously worked on titles such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pentiment, Grounded, and the Outer Worlds series. The developer is also working on Avowed, expected later this year.</p>

<p>Fans speculate that Obsidian’s unannounced title might be a sequel to Fallout: New Vegas, since that would be a timely project.</p>



<p>In Microsoft’s latest financial report, CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-impact-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed the impact</a> of Amazon’s live-action Fallout series. Just last month, creatives on the show mentioned that season 2 appears to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-reportedly-ahead-of-schedule-wont-have-anthology-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of schedule</a> already.</p>



<p>However, many of Obsidian’s titles perform very well, so other IP could be sensible too. Pentiment still has a 7.5 user score on Metacritic, and it’s getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pentiment-physical-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical release soon</a>.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Obsidian Entertainment also offered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive showcase</a> for Avowed. Fans expect Avowed to launch on November 12, 2024. </p>



<p>At this time, Obsidian did not officially confirm anything about Cabuco’s role or the title they are apparently working on.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-decade-on-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-now-a-brilliant-destination-for-skyrim-and-oblivion-fans.942030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/a-decade-on-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-now-a-brilliant-destination-for-skyrim-and-oblivion-fans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This year marks the sixth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6’s teaser trailer. And with Skyrim turning 13 years old this November, it’s safe to say that Elder Scrolls fans have endured – and will continue to endure – a long wait for Bethesda’s next fantasy RPG. But while the famed single-player studio has been focusing its efforts on nuclear wastelands and outer space, the beloved world of Tamriel hasn’t been neglected. The Elder Scrolls Online, once much-maligned and suffering sinking player counts, is now celebrating its tenth anniversary and the launch of its eighth major expansion. And while it may be an MMO by genre, by design it’s much closer to the classic Elder Scrolls RPG format than you might expect. If you’ve spent a decade desperately searching for more stories from Tamriel, then you need look no further than Elder Scrolls Online’s ongoing saga. </p><p>Rich Lambert, game director at ZeniMax Online Studios, explains that the Elder Scrolls Online team made a “big design call to move into a more Skyrim-adjacent lane” several years ago. When TESO first launched, it was derided by many for feeling like a traditional MMO (level grind and all) wearing Elder Scrolls pajamas. Nowadays, the developers don’t even consider the game to fit the ‘MMORPG’ label.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We decided that this was going to be more of an Elder Scrolls game and focus on Elder Scrolls things first, and be multiplayer second,” Lambert says. “Once we did that it started informing lots of things.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lambert sees the core appeal of The Elder Scrolls Online as being one and the same as Skyrim and Oblivion: “One of our core pillars is freedom of exploration and freedom to be and live in the world,” he says. “That traditional Elder Scrolls feeling where you see something in the distance, you can just run to it and explore it.” </p><p>The game as it stands now straddles the divide between single-player and online RPG design, offering all the elements you’d expect of a mainline Elder Scrolls game (including a world that permanently changes based on your story decisions, via some smart instancing), but it took a couple of years to get there. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We decided to focus on Elder Scrolls things first, and be multiplayer second. Once we did that it started informing lots of things.</p></div><p>Lambert notes that 2015’s Orsinium DLC saw the game’s storytelling “shift away from traditional MMO style to a more Elder Scrolls narrative style, focused more on the character, their beliefs and how they experience the world.” Later, in early 2016, some more traditional Elder Scrolls elements were introduced, such as Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, which encouraged stealing from or assassinating NPCs in the shared world. But it wasn’t until late 2016 that the game truly turned itself around.</p><p>The One Tamriel update was the turning point for TESO, removing traditional level-based progression in favor of scaling player’s stats to match whatever region you’re in. Outside of dungeon matchmaking being unlocked gradually as you level up to ensure total newbies don’t frustrate more experienced players, there’s nothing stopping a new player from immediately skipping out on the main story and running straight into an ‘endgame’ dungeon. With a decent party, you might even win. Finally, you could treat the game like Skyrim, albeit with a shared world and dungeons geared for co-op.</p><p>As such, the much memed wait for a new Elder Scrolls game needn’t be as long and torturous as the seemingly endless journey towards Todd Howard’s next project. The sixth Elder Scrolls is (sort of) already here. Many fans are turning to TESO over replaying Skyrim yet again, partly because of that re-tooled gameplay, but also because of how much of the world’s previously-underexplored lore is elaborated on here. Each major expansion and piece of DLC brings a set of new environments, and the game has been around long enough to fill in many of the blanks of The Elder Scrolls’ world map. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/teso-elsweyr-1722346356441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>TESO's Elsweyr expansion took us to the Khajiit homelands, a place never visisted by the single-player Elder Scrolls RPGs.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“We’ve taken places that are only vaguely touched on [in the mainline RPG series], like the Sister’s Isles, and turned them into our High Isle release from a couple years ago,” explains Bill Slavicsek, TESO’s narrative director. “All we knew about that was a couple dots on the map and a mention in a book, and we turned that into a whole chapter and DLC. Any place on the map you can think of, we wanna go there. And if it’s not on the map, we want to make it”.</p><p>It feels like The Elder Scrolls Online is well on track to fill out the complete world map. There’s more filled-in regions than empty space now, plus an assortment of interesting new extraplanar locations to dimension-hop around in. While the Morrowind expansion helped bring in nostalgic fans wanting to explore its strange volcanic environment and insect-and-fungus based ecosystem, the Elder Scrolls lore buffs were best served by the Elsweyr expansion, finally taking a deep dive into the much-mentioned but never-seen lands of the feline Khajiit.</p><p>Not only did Elsweyr give us our first real look at its lush savannas and a wider range of Khajiit body types (thanks to lunar magic, they can be born as anything from nearly human to literal talking housecats), but it was an opportunity for ZeniMax Online Studios to carve out its own corner of the lore. Despite the accepted text being that dragons had been unseen for millennia and only returned with the launch of Skyrim, TESO had them make an appearance during the Elsweyr chapter (set a thousand years before Skyrim). Such an event did, admittedly, require some narrative sleight-of-hand to explain why nobody cares to mention it all during later in-universe eras. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Any place on the map you can think of, we wanna go there. And if it’s not on the map, we want to make it.</p></div><p>“We take reference from a lot of different sources, internal and external,” explains TESO’s loremaster, Michael Zenke. “A lot of the stuff we do though isn’t in the lore bible because it’s new. Every release we’re adding to the canon. We’ve got a great tradition of unreliable narrators in the Elder Scrolls franchise, so unless you or your player character saw something in-game, ‘that’s just someone’s opinion, man’. So we have a lot of freedom to do interesting stuff.”</p><p>While armed with a reliable trick to handwave events that might throw later lore into chaos, ZeniMax’s writing team has grown ever bolder over time. It has been so many years since Skyrim (and likely several more until The Elder Scrolls 6 surfaces), effectively making TESO the one and only Elder Scrolls game of this generation. That, plus Todd Howard confirming that everything in TESO is canon, has allowed the team to expand into wholly new territories, like Fargrave, introduced in the Deadlands DLC. Fargrave is a ‘princeless’ plane of Oblivion, unaffiliated with any of the Daedric gods. A neutral border-world floating in the void, and a wholly new location that let the team cut loose in terms of both writing and environment design.</p><p>If this sounds like something a new player might want to jump straight into, then there’s nothing stopping you. Each of the major ‘Chapter’ expansions are designed to function as a self-contained adventure, letting players tackle story arcs as and when they see fit. The structure is yet another element of classic Elder Scrolls design that sets the game apart from its online peers. While the game has long-since dropped its mandatory subscription, the optional ‘ESO Plus’ subscription gives players access to all the minor DLC and most of the expansions to date, making it an especially easy game to pick up play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/teso-companions-1722346931418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Companions system allows players to adventure through Tamriel with a party of NPCs.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another aspect that has lowered the barrier to entry and further aligned TESO with its single-player siblings is the Companions system. Six customizable NPC partners (with another two due to be released soon) can be recruited to join you on your adventures, albeit one at a time. They were introduced to the game with the Blackwood expansion in 2021, but have become a ubiquitous sight, as they allow solo players to enjoy the game’s wider content more easily. Parties can also be a mixture of players and Companions, allowing tiny groups (just two, in many cases) to tackle some of the bigger, tougher dungeons and open-world challenge bosses with relative ease. Plus, the companions’ constant combat barks and interjections on what they see around them makes the world feel a little less lonely for those wanting to treat TESO as a single-player game. If you’ve fond memories of scaling mountains with Teldryn Sero or Aela the Huntress in Skyrim, Companions echoes that experience. </p><p>Obviously these systems have their limits, though. Player housing is instanced, set apart from the overworld, and there’s no chance of breaking the game over your knee with mods or console commands, but the core Elder Scrolls experience is replicated surprisingly well, right down to many quests having multiple possible endings. Your final decisions may not have world-shakingly obvious impact, but they often result in the death or a change of state for an NPC that will remain in their quest location, a reminder of your decisions for that character. Play long enough and complete enough quest arcs and the world will start to feel like you’ve made a real impact in it, so long as you go back to revisit some old haunts.</p><p>Now months into the game’s year-long anniversary celebrations, the future's looking bright for The Elder Scrolls Online. The team seems confident that if TESO keeps it up for another decade, it might well encompass the entire Elder Scrolls world (and yet more locations beyond) by the time the 20th anniversary begins. In the meantime, Lambert mentions that there are plans to improve the experience for new or returning players. “As a new player, or someone coming back after a year, it can be overwhelming,” he admits. “So we’re working on some systems to make that kind of experience better. Not necessarily hand-holdy, but more informational”. Beyond that, some big changes (details of which he refuses to divulge) are coming to player housing, and further refinements to the game’s balance to keep the meta in check.</p><p>I once wrote off The Elder Scrolls Online as a half-hearted cash-in. Now, it’s a game I’ve been playing on and off for around five years now, dipping back into and thoroughly enjoying when that Elder Scrolls itch needs scratching. While the incredible community keeps Skyrim alive through mods, that’s a very different experience to exploring brand new, official stories and regions of Tamriel. TESO may not be The Elder Scrolls 6, but it’s a continuing Elder Scrolls game that’s successfully shifted and changed to reflect the wants of a fanbase that grew up on acclaimed single-player RPGs. And that’s a fine place to be for a ten-year-old online game.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Elder Scrolls: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's the entire Elder Scrolls series in one easy-to-track playlist, including major DLC chapters and rereleases. </p></div><p><em>The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s upcoming addition of Dynamax mechanics has been something of an open secret - and now we're able to see how some elements will look in-game for the first time. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Pokémon Go have peered inside the popular mobile game's files to find visual elements of the upcoming Dynamax system, which also offer clues as to how Dynamax Pokémon will be obtained. 
</p>
<p>
For the first time since Pokémon Go's launch all the way back in 2016, new locations look set to appear on the game's overworld map - currently labelled as "stations". These gym-like structures look like they'll host raids for Dynamax Pokémon.

<p>
A list of Dynamax moves has also been discovered, set to be added to Dynamax Pokémon, such as "Max Flare", "Max Knuckle", and "Max Ooze".

<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-set-to-add-gen-8s-dynamax-mechanic">Pokémon Go developer Niantic signalled that it would add Gen 8's game-changing Dynamax mechanic</a> in the not-too-distant future.
</p>
<p>
This year's anniversary artwork for the game, which frequently hints at upcoming (and sometimes far-off) features shows a Dynamaxed Wartortle alongside the eight generation's trio of Starter Pokémon: Grooky, Scorbunny and Sobble.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go fans have been waiting patiently for the arrival of most Gen 8 Pokémon into the game, after the Sword and Shield generation was largely skipped over to focus on the timelier Gen 9.
</p>
<p>
"We've definitely been thinking a lot about Gen 8 for a while in Pokémon Go," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka told me</a> last month. "Nothing to share right now in terms of the timing or launch strategy there, but something we're always trying to do is play homage to the source material and do right by that source material.
</p>
<p>
"Know that as the team is thinking about Gen 8 Pokémon, they're thinking about Galar, they're thinking about what makes those Pokémon special, and when it's time for them to make their debut in Pokémon Go, it will make sense."

<p>
Nintendo announced the offer today as a feature of its new Mega Multiplayer Festival, which runs from now until 8th September.
</p>
<p>

<p>
The coming month will see other bonuses, including additional Gold Points available via the eShop and My Nintendo Store on game purchases made between 5th August at 9am UK time to 18th August. 
</p>
<p>
Additional Switch game trials of four full multiplayer titles will be available from 19th to 25th August, meanwhile - though the identity of these games will be announced at a later date.
</p>
<p>
After that, the Mega Multiplayer game sale will run from 26th August to 8th September, in case you liked any of the titles available for trial and want to pick them up at a discount. 
</p>
<p>
The next month is a quiet period for Nintendo, and it's currently a transitional time for the company in general as it gears up to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> at some point before 1st April 2025.
</p>
<p>
There's still several Switch 1 games still to go, however - most notably including The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (26th September), Super Mario Party Jamboree (17th October), Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership (7th November), and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (16th January 2025).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/from-gta-to-the-internet-of-things-what-lazlow-jones-did-next<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“I can't avoid the internet of things now while we're doing this interview,” Lazlow Jones tells me, picking up his phone. He’s sitting in his home office in California speaking to a reporter half the world away on the south coast of England, explaining what his new venture — his Absurd Ventures — is all about. And it’s all about the internet of things. Of course, I learn this in an interview that wouldn’t be possible without the internet of things.</p><p>“My cat took a shit, and I know that because I have a litter robot that sends me a text message whenever he goes to the bathroom,” Lazlow continues, putting the world to rights from the bottom half of my laptop screen.</p><p>One of the characters in audio science fiction series <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/a-better-paradise-volume-one-an-aftermath">A Better Paradise</a>, called NigelDave (yes, all one word, more on him later) is also trying to "solve" the problem that is humanity, but he's using the internet of things to do it. Probably not the best idea.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But that is what A Better Paradise and, it seems, much of what Absurd Ventures is all about. And it is <em>a lot</em>. There’s this audio series, yes, but also a graphic novel set within an entirely different universe, called American Caper. Then there’s the mystery video game — let’s be real here, the video game is the main event — that has already sparked enthusiastic headlines based on job adverts that suggest what sort of video game Absurd Ventures is trying to make.</p><p>It’s hard not to get excited when you read about former Rockstar developers who are working on an "open-world action-adventure game." Lazlow doesn’t want anyone thinking Absurd Ventures is taking Rockstar on at its own game with some sort of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption competitor. Of course he doesn't — those games cost hundreds of millions to make and take years and years to put together. But then, these aren't just any former Rockstar developers.</p><p>Let’s start with Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, who left the company — and his brother Sam — back in 2020. This is <em>the</em> Dan Houser, the Londoner who wrote GTA and Red Dead for all those years, who made it big in New York to the tune of billions of dollars. And then he left, and now he’s going it alone, making a brand new "open-world action-adventure game." Yes, it’s hard not to get excited.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/a-better-paradise-bts-lazlow-1722374224496.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Lazlow Jones.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Houser is not alone, of course. His partner in crime here is Lazlow Jones, who to the average GTA fan is perhaps an even more recognisable name than Dan Houser. The former journalist and radio host became the voice of GTA for a generation of gamers after he produced, scripted, and hosted the hugely popular Chatterbox FM radio station in 2001’s seminal <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iii">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>.</p><p>From there, Lazlow worked with Dan Houser on pretty much every Rockstar game as a co-writer, coming up with all sorts of crazy ideas to satirize whatever place and time were the focus of the development team's attention. Dialogue, quest design, even Easter eggs — Lazlow was there. It’s almost overwhelming to interview him. Where to start? Which of the long list of Rockstar games he worked on over a near 20-year stretch to pick his brains on first?</p><p>Perhaps it is best, though, to start by asking about the end. With <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> bringing in billions for Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> an enormous hit in its own right, and with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> development ramping up, Lazlow left Rockstar. He <em>left</em> Rockstar. You’re at the top of the video game development mountain, and then you jump off. Why?</p><p>Just a few weeks after Red Dead Redemption 2 launched in October 2018, Lazlow’s sister told him she had terminal cancer. He moved her in with him and became her primary caregiver, while still writing and producing and directing and doing all the other things one must do while working for Rockstar. “I spent a lot of time writing comedy from chemo awards,” he says, matter of factly, “which is a very interesting creative exercise.”</p><p>Taking care of his dying sister “snapped me out to analyze things,” Lazlow admits. He left Rockstar, and then the pandemic hit.</p><p>“I spent time watching a lot of documentaries like that Black Mirror documentary and just trying to figure out what was the next creative step,” he says. This makes a lot of sense to me, having listened to a few episodes of A Better Paradise (it’s very Black Mirror). His old friend Dan, who had also left Rockstar, asked Lazlow to join him in forming Absurd Ventures in Santa Monica. And so he did.</p><p>I ask about burnout. I ask if he got sick of making GTA and Red Dead. Lazlow won’t go as far as to agree to either suggestion, but does point out that he shipped nine GTA games from 2001 to 2020. That’s a lot of GTA. He went from GTA 5 to Red Dead Redemption 2 and then to GTA Online as that was blowing up, and then GTA 6. He was, he says, “excited” to work on a new intellectual property. When Dan Houser told him it was set in the future — Lazlow hadn’t worked on anything set in the future while at Rockstar — it made even more sense to him.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/a-better-paradise-bts-andrew-lincoln-1722374360484.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Better Paradise features the voice of The Walking Dead star Andrew Lincoln.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Still, all this new stuff, everything Absurd Ventures is doing, is satire in the truest Rockstar sense. It is a satire of an imagined future rather than the America of today or decades past, but it is satire nonetheless. Rockstar has form when it comes to nailing a certain time period. Absurd Ventures is trying to nail the future.</p><p>Where do you start? AI, it seems. I roll my eyes at the thought — I’m already sick of AI and it’s just getting started. Absurd Ventures, though, is coming at it from a Rockstar-style perspective. That is, how do you take the piss out of AI in 2030? In 2040?</p><p>Back to NigelDave, a comedy AI character with a split personality. In the A Better Paradise story, NigelDave, played by British actor Paterson Joseph, is an AI created by a fictional future video game development team to help build the open-world game they’re working on. In the process, NigelDave tries to work out what humanity is all about, and struggles a bit.</p><p>Here's the Black Mirror bit: A Better Paradise imagines a future where AI is used to create advertisements in real-time to manipulate the viewer into buying a product. “We are headed in that direction,” Lazlow says, more annoyed than concerned. Perhaps we’re there already.</p><p>It started small, just Dan Houser and Lazlow Jones and two dogs in the early days, but Absurd Ventures has grown steadily as work on three(!) different universes, two of which are announced, ramped up. Other former Rockstar developers have joined the team. Something, it seems, is happening here.</p><p>Three different universes, an audio fiction series and a video game set in one, a graphic novel set in another, and who knows what else set in the third — it’s too much for a developer without a single title under its belt to take on right off the bat, surely? Lazlow has an answer for this, and it goes back to his time at Rockstar, where the team worked on loads of different types of media for GTA and Red Dead all of the time, all at the same time.</p><p>“This morning I was working on A Better Paradise Volume 2, and when I run out of gas on that, I jump over to American Caper or the third IP that we haven't officially announced yet,” he says, enthusiastically. “And so it allows my creative brain to jump between different things and vastly different universes. It's exciting.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/a-better-paradise-bts-paterson-joseph-1722374466133.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>NigelDave is played by British actor Paterson Joseph.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's a lot, then, but a lot quicker, too. Rockstar takes a long time to make video games. It’s one of a handful of developers in the world that can afford to do so. There will be a 12 year gap between the release of GTA 5 and GTA 6, assuming GTA 6 does indeed come out fall 2025 as Rockstar has said it will.</p><p>Hopefully it won’t be long before we see something of this video game Absurd Ventures is working on. Perhaps we'll see it before GTA 6 comes out. But what is <em>it</em>, exactly? Don’t spend too long wondering, it's not that deep.</p><p>“We've confirmed that we're working on a game that's in the A Better Paradise universe, and people that are trying to dig around about what does that feel and sound like?" Lazlow starts. "Well, the audio fiction series is about a fictional game team in the future, making an open-world game. As you listen through the 12 episodes, there are scenes where the dev teams working on that open-world game are having conversations about its features. You hear people playing the game, you hear people inside the open-world game exploring around, especially as it starts to get weirder and weirder with the AI creating different aspects of that world. So a lot of the questions could be answered by listening to the series.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Facebook has turned into this thing that has turned the downfall of Western civilization into entertainment.</p></div><p>It’s all very meta (not the Facebook kind), and, I think, all very <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-truman-show">The Truman Show</a>. It’s a world within a world, but one we play around in knowing full well that we, the players, are a part of the story. It's a video game "developed" by a fictional video game developer, itself created by a real-life video game developer. I think Absurd Ventures is trying to say something here.  </p><p>Perhaps it's trying to say something about the future (the now?) of video game development. In A Better Paradise, people find they’re getting dangerously addicted to this open-world game, but it’s because the AI has mined their memories and is tailoring the game world to their experience. One character sees a dead family member in the game, another has a conversation with a clone of himself. Players can't put the controller down because the game is just so personal, and then things start to go wrong.</p><p>A Better Paradise is set 10 or 20 years in the future, but it feels like a satire of a future right around the corner. I wouldn’t be surprised to see, say, Ubisoft or EA or even Rockstar giving such an AI-driven video game experience a good go, no doubt powered by some impossible to understand Nvidia tech that has shareholders salivating. On PlayStation 6? The next Xbox? Why not? It doesn’t sound so absurd.</p><p>For Lazlow, his exit from Rockstar a now four-year-old memory, he's getting to play in a different way, too. "Facebook's going to bring us all together," he remembers of the social network's original promise. "You are going to be able to see when a friend from high-school had a baby and, oh my god! It's going to be this heartwarming future. But Facebook has turned into this thing that has turned the downfall of Western civilization into entertainment."</p><p>A Better Paradise indeed.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

the Goat Simulator table, things get weird with this crossover as it has headbutting bumpers, a big red button that can be triggered to start a nuclear apocalypse, a chance to stop an alien invasion,

I was just being a (wildly charismatic, dashing) idiot.</em></p><p>In my brief time with massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/"></a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout London</a>, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”</p>
<p>“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services <em>are</em> crap!” I was having a <em>good</em> time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.</p>

<p>I am not alone in this. There's a <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153">patch on the way</a>, and there are already a few supposed fixes. One of which involves <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-crash">downloading yet another mod</a>. The other is a apparently a Nvidia issue with the ‘Weapon Debris’ setting. Unfortunately, to turn that off I have to uninstall FOLON and Fallout 4, then reinstall Fallout 4 to access the vanilla settings menu. I have already done this twice. I initially tried to get the thing working on Steam, then had to go buy it on GOG because the downgrader wasn’t working. Then, I did a fresh install the first time I started experiencing crashes so I could tweak the settings. It did not work.</p>
<p>Simply put, I’m done. To be clear, this isn’t me saying “avoid the mod”, just that I’ve hit my own personal tolerance for pissing around with files. I’ll watch a YouTube video, because I do genuinely want to see more of what FOLON has on offer. So, PSA then: try to get set up with the extra mods and settings you need <em>before</em> you go in, to avoid similar ballaches. That, or wait for the patch.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame, because London seems great so far. Everything from architecture to lighting, to a new dialogue system more reminiscent of New Vegas, is such an incredible step up from vanilla Fallout 4. Feast your mince pies on this station from the opening area:</p>

<p>It reminded me far more of Bioshock’s spooky grandeur than what I was expecting, but it works well. I’m also finding the lack of traditional Fallout iconography to be incredibly refreshing. I don’t think I’m alone in feeling that Vault Boy and Nuka-Cola have long been stripped of any satirical charm they once might have held; mascot-ified to Funko Pop tier, all dead gloss like the eyes of taxidermied critters. But here, even the Pip Boy has been replaced, and these new symbols are enough to run interference on stifling familiarity, revitalising the setting. Also, again: you can restore health by eating pink wafers.</p>
<p>So, do enjoy Fallout London when you get around to it. I’m certain you will, just make sure you’re all set up beforehand. Me? I’m going to have nightmares about a giant file that simply will not unzip.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A mod has been released for the fan-made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod Fallout: London to change all football references to soccer.
</p>
<p>
Fallout: London, unsurprisingly, transports the post-apocalypse of the series to the English capital and has been created by a group of British fans, Team Folon.
</p>
<p>
That means the mod is full of British references, but the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/11?tab=description">It's A Soccer Ball mod</a> on NexusMods from GrumpyOldNord changes things for American players.

<p>
"Are you an American exploring London for the first time and find some of the lingo a bit confusing?" reads the mod description. "Have no fear! The soccer ball is now properly named so as to avoid confusion with a real football."
</p>
<p>
Not only is the ball itself renamed, but the Football Kit outfit has been changed to Soccer Uniform.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, this has caused quite a stir. 
</p>
<p>
"Immersion restored," reads one comment on the mod's NexusMods page. "Finally, a good mod on Nexus," reads another.
</p>
<p>
One comment even suggests to go "full circle and change all the spelling as well. Turn this into a damn salt mine".
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/11-1721959587-1489190043.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Other comments, presumably from Brits, are more horrified. In fact, fans have tagged the mod as "horror" along with the creator's "humour, joke or just for fun".
</p>
<p>
There are replies of "Oi govna!" and "R u havin a giggle?", though one takes it a step further: "Reporting this mod for terrorism. Absolutely dastardly behaviour, you deserve a hundred fortnights in the stocks."
</p>
<p>
It's - mostly - all in good faith. "This is the best troll mod in a long time," wrote one fan. 
</p>
<p>
Of course it's also brought up plenty of comments about the origins of the term soccer - ironically it's from Britain. The sport was known as Association Football, which was shortened to "assoccer" - the name then stuck over in America to differentiate it from what became American Football.
</p>
<p>
If anything, the popularity of the mod reflects the success of Fallout: London overall. However, it's been an unstable launch with players noting plenty of performance issues.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">Team Folon is working on fixes</a>, with an update on the way soon.
