<p>Promo A is likely the first of many promotional sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket. I get you want to focus your efforts on collecting the main cards, but certain promo cards might not be around forever. The cards’ obtainability might get harder over time, meaning you should set your sights on unlocking Promo A Cards faster than a Rapidash.</p>



<p>You might find yourself overwhelmed by Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early release content. The card-collecting title is not content to rest on its laurels though—oh no. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-tcg-pocket-secret-missions-rewards-how-to-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Missions</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-tcg-pocket-level-up-rewards-xp-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level-up rewards</a> easily eat into your time, and even more is sure to be spent trying to collect all the Promo A Cards.</p>



<p>We’ve got information on every Pokémon TCG Pocket Promo A Card, how to get them, and much more.</p>







<figure><figcaption>There’s quite a few to catch. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s thought <strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket has 24 Promo A Cards to collect</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a hint of trepidation about this figure because not every card has been released yet—the available information regarding Promo A is based on released cards, and datamined cards. With suggestions the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Pokémon Pocket expansion</a> is a while away yet, more Promo A Cards could be added later on.</p>







<p>Here’s a closer look at every Promo A Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket and the conditions required to unlock each one. Thanks to <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/promo-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Serebii</a> for clarification on a couple of the remaining cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-call-for-change-to-going-first-mechanic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"One advantage, however, is that you can concede faster."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> adapts the beloved card game into a speedier experience more fit for mobile, but players can't get their heads around one rule change regarding going first and are calling on developer Creatures Inc. to change it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its simplest, the Pokémon TCG works by players attaching energy to their Pokémon to do attacks, with more energy resulting in bigger damage dealt. Pokémon are eventually knocked out and, once a certain number are defeated, someone wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card games commonly apply nerfs to the player who goes first so they don't gain an unfair advantage over what's essentially a coin toss, and the Pokémon TCG is no different. The player going first draws a card and can attach a single energy to a Pokémon, as normal, though isn't allowed to attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This balances things out a touch as, while player two is the first to attack and therefore do damage, player one can swing back the following turn with two energy and a bigger attack. But Pokémon TCG changes this mechanic by only allowing a card draw on the first turn, making the entire thing, some players believe, completely redundant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we seem to all acknowledge going first in this game feels awful, and don't get me started about the one energy evolutions which benefit off going first," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gm5u0x/going_1st_sucks/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user Seedler420 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can't we trade the possibility of attacking turn one, which in terms of gameplay doesn't make any sense, with the possibility of attaching energy turn one? This way the player going first would have energy advantage while the player going second would have the first attack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way Pokémon TCG Pocket works essentially gives the advantage to the player going second, as they have both the energy advantage and the first damage advantage. "It would feel a little better if we at least got to put energy on a card first turn," said one player in the comments. "It definitely feels bad," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. did ask for feedback when it announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-passes-30-million-downloads-in-9-days">more than 30 million players had downloaded the game in just nine days</a>, so perhaps if enough people complain a change will come about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 as a streamlined and has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that immediately proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is keeping busy since launch as it has already added three events to the game: one focused on collecting, one focused on solo battles, and one focused on player versus player battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part also released today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">let players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex. And a PVP event was later added too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">putting badges on the line in true Pokémon fashion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, players are looking to take the best decks into these events, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating so far</a>. One outlier comes via Misty though, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">whose heads or tails effect is driving many up the wall</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord.1031160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has reflected on the disastrous launch of PlayStation 5 game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, saying it’s still learning when it comes to live service games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony hauled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>It eventually shuttered Firewalk and confirmed Concord wouldn’t return</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>, which cited two sources familiar with the agreement. They said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself. Kotaku's number aligns with an <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/sony-acquires-video-game-studio/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>earlier report</u></a> saying that ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to Concord being seen as an ambitious project that was expected to attract a large audience. Instead it launched to tepid reviews and low interest, prompting PlayStation to pull the plug within days of release. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott told IGN shortly before Concord was shut down: “Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company has learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki said. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki is that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2153633660-1731080199508.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches. That’s all I have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Concord launched into the ultra competitive live service hero shooter market following the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which contributed to a $200 million hit to publisher Warner Bros.’ revenue.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live-service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service push has seen mixed results so far. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, but other live service games have fallen by the wayside. In December last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog canceled a live service The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and announced plans to focus on single-player games. Sony-owned developer Bungie, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">has suffered significant layoffs as a result of Destiny 2’s struggles</a>. The failure of Concord and the closure of Firewalk is yet another troubling development for PlayStation live service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, Guerrilla’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon Online</a>, and Haven Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> debuted earlier this year, its similarities to Pokemon led observers to expect a legal response from Nintendo. That finally happened in September, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo filed a lawsuit</a> against Palworld developer Pocketpair in Japanese court alleging infringement on the company's patents. Now, Pocketpair has shared details about which patents Nintendo's claims are based on, and how much money the company wants out of the case.</p><p>Pocketpair posted <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a summery of the information</a>, which reveals that the three Japanese patents in question are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>. All three patents were registered earlier this year. Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, the patents appear to be centered around the mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>The lawsuit is asking for an injunction against Palworld, plus 5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 in American dollars) payments--with late fees--to both Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. The details of the lawsuit largely lineup with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-vs-palworld-why-nintendo-will-probably-win-according-to-analyst/1100-6526608/" data-ref-id="1100-6526608">the predictions made earlier this year</a> by Kantan Games CEO and video game analyst Serkan Toto. At the time, Toto believed that Nintendo's allegedly infringed-upon patents would be "very technical" in nature, and that Pocketpair will ultimately be forced to make a deal with Nintendo.</p><p>So far, Poketpair hasn't slowed down its ambitions for Palworld.

                <p>Sony just revealed new sales numbers for PS5, and set expectations on what kinds of games will be coming in the future for the console.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_sonypre.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">financial report from Sony</a>, the company said it shipped 3.8 million PS5 consoles during the second quarter of the fiscal year from July 2024 to September 2024. That was 29% drop from the same time period last year. The new lifetime total units shipped is now 65.5 million, making the amount just shy of the 67.5 million PS4 units shipped when it was in the same period of its lifespan.</p><p>On the bright side, Game &amp; Network Services division brought in about $7 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase. Sony attributed this to third-party games on the PS5 platform, including "an action RPG title from China," which is most likely referring to Black Myth: Wukong.

Nintendo is keen to keep the Switch's dual focus of being both a gaming handheld and home console "to carry over the experience we have already built" and reduce development costs in future, it's said.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors, Nintendo exec Ko Shiota <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">said</a> the company's current Switch hardware had benefited from the "merging" of software teams previously focused on developing for separate portable and home console platforms - such as in the era of 3DS and Wii U.
</p>
<p>
While still unannounced by Nintendo, it's widely expected that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-with-eight-inches-of-lcd-on-switch-2-report-says">Switch 2 will also be another hybrid console</a> similar to the company's current Switch hardware.

<p>
Discussing Nintendo's development process in more detail, design legend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> said that the Mario maker must focus on developing polished, original creative ideas that have "never existed before", as its research and development costs increased each year.
</p>
<p>
Rising costs were "in some respects inevitable" as games became more complex and development teams grew in scale, Miyamoto said, but Nintendo was still focused on ensuring original ideas could germinate, with time to properly "nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart".
</p>
<blockquote>"We continue refining our products until we are confident."</blockquote>
<p>
"Our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development," Miyamoto explained. "We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo must spend time finding the ideas that are worth honing, Miyamoto continued, saying this was a concept that had "not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System", 40 years ago. 
</p>
<p>
"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing," Miyamoto continued. "However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. 
</p>
<p>
"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again."
</p>
<p>
Not all gaming ideas needed big budgets, Miyamoto concluded, noting that simple yet intriguing ideas could still become projects with wide appeal "without incurring significant costs". 
</p>
<p>
"With the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time," Miyamoto concluded. "We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's continued silence on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> was broken - briefly - this week with confirmation that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor would indeed be backwards compatible</a>. When might we hear more about Switch 2? This week, Eurogamer was told by an analyst that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">"the ship had sailed" on a 2024 reveal for Switch 2</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> has been out for a little while already, what with me giving its multiplayer largely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">thumbs up</a>. Still, it's an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game's first seasonal drop. It's a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I'll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there's some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I'm mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> Season One kicks off on November 14th and it'll bring with the usual assortment of things. Some guns, many of which will likely be meta almost immediately. One is a power drill melee weapon that I immediately want but can't be arsed to unlock. There are new Operators, too, one of which looks like the Haze guy from that PS3 game.</p>
<p>Really, though, the highlights here are the new maps. Hideout being a training site home to some "intense indoor combat", which looks fine? Heirloom looks the most interesting, being a private art gallery filled with lots of nice sculptures and shiny lobbies to sling lead in. Hacienda arrives mid-season, the vineyard estate returning from Black Ops 4 and sure to please fans of a game I genuinely can't recall.</p>

<p>A new game mode called Ransack arrives at launch, where you've got to loot gold bars from crates dotted around maps, then bring them successfully back to your team's stash. It's all about collecting and raiding and pilfering - sounds fun, to be honest.</p><p>One new scorestreak has caught my eye, with it being a big Hand Cannon. Hit 900 points in a single life and you'll "equip a massively powerful hand cannon for a finite amount of time". It'll have "high-penetration shots that can one-shot enemies", a bit like the Golden Gun from the Hunter class in Destiny 2, eh.</p>
<p>In zombies there will be a new Directed mode, that I'll 100% use. Turn this on and it'll mean that zombies objectives will be clearly marked with a maximum round cap of 15, turning it into an easy to follow story experience. I'm also looking forward to the new map, which is an "abandoned castle", with promises of a "medieval village".</p>
<p>Elsewhere there's a new ranked mode for people who take their Duty very seriously and the introduction of omni-movement and Blops 6's guns to Warzone.</p>

However, the new dev hasn’t quite landed on the same success as the original titles from Don’t Nod, unfortunately.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196358,196663" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of this writing,<em> Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> sits at a ‘Mixed’ rating on Steam. Most of the game’s negative reviews mention the lack of Chloe as the primary reason they didn’t enjoy this experience. Of course, most of the positive reviews also mention Chloe. </p><p>On the topic of the negative reviews, we would be remiss not to mention the advanced access edition of the game, which asked players to spend more money to play <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>—a story-driven single-player game—a few days ahead of the full release. Developers use this tactic to coax a nice chunk of change out of the community’s pockets, and many pay. </p><p>But let’s talk about the positives, because<em> Life is Strange </em>remains an exceptionally complex and captivating story worthy of attention and, for the most part, praise. Regarding the many positive reviews on Steam, players note the story, facial expressions, graphics, and, of course, the characters themselves, like Max and Amanda. They remain fan favorites.</p><p>Whether you’re new to the franchise or a returning player looking for closure from this long-running tale, <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> provides a unique experience that captivates most players from the get-go. Here’s a look at the latest <em>Life is Strange</em> game, as told by Steam reviews!</p><figure id="" data-id="b44284ed06f5354d5bb47f91b79480dc"

Firstly, he suggested PlayStation needs to be checking in earlier on during  the development process to determine if things are on track or not. Secondly, the company has been too siloed when approaching new projects, needing more communication between teams. Thirdly, the release timing for <em>Concord</em> might have been especially bad. And finally, live-service multiplayer games are just risky even if everything is done right. </p><p>Here are Totoki’s full comments during today’s second quarter earnings call via Sony’s translator:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Currently, we are still in the process of learning and basically with regards to IP you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for us for our reflection probably we need to have a lot of gates including user testing and user evaluation and the timing of such gates we need to bring them forward and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did. </p><p>And also we did have a siloed organization so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in both development and sales and I think that could have been much more smoother. </p><p>Going forward in our first-party titles and third-party title we do have many different windows and we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalization so we can maximize performance in terms of title launches.</p></blockquote><p><em>Concord</em> launched back in August, and struggled to gain any traction with players—a death sentence for a live service game that relies in part on a healthy player pool to reduce matchmaking times, and make players confident that the game they’re investing in won’t soon disappear. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened with the hero shooter after Sony took the unprecedented step of unreleasing it just a couple weeks later. The game, with an initial development deal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a></span> at $200 million, has since been fully refunded and the team behind it, Firewalk Studios, disbanded in a mass layoff last month. </p><p>“The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title,” PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst said at the time. “We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.” The 170 developers cut as part of Firewalk brings Sony’s total gaming layoffs for the year up to 1,290. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous and groundbreaking creative types across all of entertainment, but the man himself doesn't agree that he's a genius. As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings briefing</a>, Miyamoto pushed back against the suggestion that he's been able for decades to turn out hit after hit because he's a "genius."</p><p>"You referred to me as a 'genius,' but I consider myself quite ordinary," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to say he gives a speech each year to Nintendo's new hires, and the feedback he gets from these people is that he is "surprisingly ordinary."</p><p>Making great games allows Miyamoto to have an easier career, he said. "I often think it would be fun if I didn't have to work, so I'm always thinking about things like, well, if I have to work, how can I do it more efficiently. And if I am going to do the same work, how can I make it more of a hit, because when a project is a hit it makes future work easier," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to reveal more of what he tells new hires coming to Nintendo. He said many people come to work at Nintendo and aspire to make "upgraded versions" of games they've played before. But Miyamoto pushes back against this idea and encourages them to think differently.</p><p>"[Game design] is about observing the world around us and figuring out how to assemble those elements into an engaging video game," he said. "I explain that game design is about planning. That is, it is about assessing what hardware and development environment to use to create the game, whether the desired game can be realized with its available processing power, and engaging in trial and error to bring it to life."</p><p>Miyamoto has had a long and illustrious career at Nintendo. The 71-year-old started at Nintendo all the way back in 1977 and helped create Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda. He's remained a key player at Nintendo to this day in his "Creative Fellow" position, contributing to all manner of Nintendo game franchises. In addition to his work on Nintendo's game franchises, he was an executive producer on 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will produce the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Legend of Zelda film.</a> He's also involved in the Nintendo theme parks.</p><p>Miyamoto has no plans to retire, but has admitted he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">spent time thinking about who may fill his shoes</a> one day.</p><p>As for Nintendo's hardware business, the Switch is now in its eighth year on the market. It's sold more than 146 million units worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">all eyes are on Nintendo to reveal the Switch 2 by April 2025. </a></p>

            <p>
Almost two years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>'s PlayStation launch, Sony Santa Monica has - after introducing the feature in September's PC release - finally made it possible to stop blabbermouth companions from incessantly spewing out puzzle hints on console.
</p>
<p>
Puzzle-ruining companions were one of the most consistent criticisms levied at the otherwise extremely well-received God of War Ragnarök back in 2021, with users lamenting Sony Santa Monica's rather condescending decision to almost immediately shower players with hints on encountering a new puzzle, rather than giving them space to find solutions for themselves.
</p>
<p>
"I am now many (many) hours further into Ragnarök, and yet these 'hints' just keep on coming," a rather exasperated Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-overly-helpful-characters-create-a-puzzling-puzzle-problem">wrote on Eurogamer at the time</a>, "with varying degrees of abruptness from those delivering them."

<p>
Thankfully, when God of War Ragnarök finally made its way to PC back in September, Sony Santa Monica had taken criticism of the PlayStation version to heart, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc-lets-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints">introducing an option that specifically reduced the frequency companions doled out puzzle hints</a>. And that option - as Sony previously promised - is now available on console.
</p><p>
The feature arrives as part of Ragnarök's 06.00 update, which also brings a new Audio Descriptions accessibility option for all in-game cinematics, bug fixes, and a range of PS5 Pro-specific enhancements. The latter include a new mode enabling Favour Quality features while running at 60fps, a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option, plus the ability to unlock framerates when using variable refresh rate monitors. Full details can be <a href="https://support.sms.playstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/31642737345293-Patch-Notes-v-06-00">found on Sony's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the PC version of God of War Ragnarök, Digital Foundry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">broadly impressed</a> when it took a closer look back in September, praising some "super-smooth gaming" while criticising "edge case problems that need addressing".

            <p>Activision has unveiled what's coming up in Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s first season, which is scheduled to launch on 14th November.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - players can also expect a "vast amount" of free and premium content, including a new Zombies "experience in-season", plus full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone.</p>

<p>Treyarch has outlined what's coming up in painfully busy infographic below, revealing that as well as the arrival of Racket (2v2 and 6v6), Hacienda (6v6), and Nuketown Holiday (6v6) mid-season, three new maps are also en-route: Hideout, Extraction, and Heirloom.</p><p>Hideout is described as a medium-sized training site featuring signature Black Ops design, whilst Extraction boasts the medium-sized Avalon Heliport "built for a variety of playstyles". Heirloom is more compact and features a "fine art museum built for fast-paced action". All are available for 6v6, with the latter also coming for 2v2.</p>
<p>Players can also expect ranked multiplayer games, as well as the new modes Ransack and Prophunt - the former requires you to loot gold bars and get them out whilst ensuring the enemy can't raid your stash, whilst the latter is "an infamous game of hide-and-seek". Whilst Prophunt launches mid-season, Ransack goes live at launch.</p> <div>

<p>There's also seven new weapons, a new Zombies map, plus fans can expect a festive reimagining of Nuketown for the holiday season, too.</p>
<p>There's more - much more! - so head on over to the official <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement">website</a> for the full details.</p>
<p>The season update comes on the heels of a chunky patch that, along with general fixes to things such as stability and progression, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-hefty-update-with-swathe-of-weapon-adjustments">has also made sweeping adjustments to its multiplayer weapons</a>.</p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty Black Ops 6 review</a>, giving it three out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In August, inZOI released a demo of the game's Character Studio so that those who were interested to see how The Sims competitor played out could have a chance. The game was originally meant to be released before 2024 was finished, but it looks like that dream has been dashed, and it's now set to enter Early Access on March 28, 2025. Today, inZOI Director and Producer Kjun made an announcement<a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1854509177508593738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854509177508593738%7Ctwgr%5E7b573ef972c48b9dd35f814b1f86691118ccede4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fthe-sims-competitor-inzoi-will-now-enter-early-access-on-march-28-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Discord</a>, giving the statement that the Early Access period of the upcoming competitor has been delayed to March 28. inZOI was also a game that was showcased at Gamescom and received a lot of positive chatter and feedback about their title.</p>
<p>"After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start."</p>
<p>Of course, to those who enjoy life simulators, this does come as a pretty disappointing announcement, especially as the Character Studio seemed to be well received, with many people posting pictures of their creations online. Compared to The Sims, the game is shaping up to be hyper-realistic, with a ton of built-in customization, something that is often seen to be a little bit lacking in The Sims without the use of mods or custom content.</p>
<p>Continuing his statement, Kjun provided a peculiar analogy: "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's uncertain whether the Character Studio demo will remain available for people to keep playing on, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/"> KRAFTON</a> and inZOI's development team haven't made an announcement about this as of yet. However, it's possible that they will mention this in their Discord server, which is a hub of activity and conversation between fans and developers alike.</p>

<p>A number of employees at Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising developer NetEase Games have been arrested, according to a new report.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng</a> — with additional context via <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg Law</a> — nine employees, including two senior executives, were arrested for allegedly laundering money.  </p>



<p>Per the report, the contract value appears to be worth 2 billion yuan, which is just about $278.6 million. In actual money, it’s a  bit lower at 800 million to 1 billion yuan, or $111.4-$139.3 million.</p>



<p>The two executives implicated in the case are Xiang Lang and Jin Yuchen. Xiang served as the head of NetEase’s esports division while Jin was the head of the company’s publishing side.  Neither executive is still with the company.</p>



<p>Names of other employees at the company weren’t made available. At least one who was questioned by outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/netease-responds-to-the-rumors-of-corruption-saying-things-are-under-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yicaiglobal</a> has denied any claims of money laundering. </p>



<p>The allegedly corruption took place within the segments of the company the two executives worked, the company said. They also confirmed that 27 different companies have been blacklisted due to links to fraud. </p>



<p>Other details of the incidents couldn’t be shared due to there still being an active investigation. More information will be provided at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-what-we-create-is-more-important-than-the-amount-spent-on-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Q&amp;A</a> with investors, Nintendo executive and storied designer Shigeru Miyamoto answered a question about the trend of rising development costs, saying that what Nintendo creates is far more important than what it spends on development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question related to rising development costs, asking if Nintendo's own expenses would increase in the future and if the company could mitigate those increases. Miyamoto stepped in to respond first, saying that while cost increases are inevitable, and Nintendo is focused on creating good and unique experiences first, it's also quite possible to make great games without spending massive piles of money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's his response, in full:</p><blockquote>Our research and development expenses have been increasing each year. Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable.</blockquote><blockquote>However, our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development. We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with. With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System. Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, in the entertainment business it is possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs. Children’s toys are a prime example of this. We believe that not all products require large costs. Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2173872596-1731077735788.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. Photo by Lars Nicolaysen/picture alliance via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fellow executives Shinya Takahashi and Ko Shiota followed up on Miyamoto's answer. Takahashi reiterated the importance of "unique titles that are small in scale" that can be expanded, rather than spending huge amounts of money. He added that the Switch has evolved in such a way that it includes different methods to limit cost increases. And Shiota added that the company is working hard to ensure developers can work efficiently, and that "bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas." Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa threw in at the end that investment in development is a necessity - otherwise Nintendo won't have great hardware and software at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same Q&amp;A, Miyamoto <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-creator-of-mario-zelda-donkey-kong-and-more-denies-being-a-genius">dismissed a question</a> referring to him as a "genius", saying new Nintendo employees had referred to the Mario, Zelda, and Pikmin creator as "surprisingly normal" after meeting him. Miyamoto has also recently made statements about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-wants-nintendo-to-be-left-out-of-the-game-wars-focused-on-high-specs-and-performance">wanting to be left out of the console wars</a>, and said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction">Nintendo would rather go in a "different direction"</a> than the rest of the industry when it comes to artificial intelligence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes ahead of Nintendo's announcement of its Switch successor console. The company recently confirmed the Switch 2, for want of a better name, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">will play Switch games and Nintendo Switch Online will carry forward</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lars Nicolaysen/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The thought is that when tearing open one of your daily free packs that you should inspect the packaging for any imperfections, like a bent corner.

			<p>Although the Xbox Series X machine learning hardware is not on the same level as the PlayStation 5 Pro's, it has some use cases, but Microsoft never showed any interest in using it.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> addressed a point of discussion that's been circulating on social media in the past few days, suggesting that Sony, with the PlayStation 5 Pro, has finally caught up with Microsoft regarding machine learning, saying that having machine learning hardware in the console, and not doing anything with it doesn't exactly mean catching up. The around 100 TOPS of the Xbox Series X are in reference to INT4, which is usually not used for machine learning upscaling. Still, there's nothing preventing Microsoft from developing a machine learning model that could run on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but the company just doesn't seem interested in doing so. The Series consoles' machine learning hardware could have been used, for example, to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-showcases-auto-sr-automatic-super-resolution-the-first-os-integrated-ai-upscaling-technology-powered-by-npus/">Auto SR</a> for Xbox 360 backward-compatible games, as the company developed a model that can operate on 40 INT8 TOPS MPUs, something that would have been easily manageable by the current generation consoles' machine learning hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #187: Concord Dead, Indiana Jones Hands-On, Horizon PC Tested, 'Disaster Remasters'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtY1se3Nvj8?start=5683&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given that the Xbox Series X|S architecture was developed back in 2016 when machine learning was on the horizon, it's not surprising that it wasn't used for anything. Things, however, are definitely set to change in the future console generation, especially after seeing the excellent results the first iteration of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</a> is capable of achieving.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong Physical Edition Launches for PS5 in December]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-physical-edition-launches-for-ps5-in-december.1031013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The physical version of celebrated action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, so mark your calendar if you've been waiting to check this one out on disc.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854901792414241099" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by physical game company PM Studios, the physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>arrives on PS5 on December 12th. Naturally, the PC version's not getting a physical edition; after all, when was the last time your PC had an honest-to-goodness disc drive?</p>

<p>If you're worried that the physical version of the game will just be one of those empty-box-with-no-actual-disc-inside deals, you needn't be. PM Studios <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854909999048458693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has confirmed</a> that the box will, in fact, contain a proper disc, and not just a code.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date-staff-spinning.jpg?itok=pSoRRQjZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date-staff-spinning.jpg?itok=pWIyjJ0C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally on the way next month.</figcaption></figure><p>The physical version of the game will contain a code for the Deluxe Edition upgrade, which will net you an extra staff and set of armor, as well as an additional curio. You can claim this equipment from the Keeper's Shrine menu.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s physical launch is anything like as successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">as the digital version was</a>, then we can likely expect this release to break a couple more sales milestones, which will no doubt make developer GameScience happy.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience and based loosely on the classical novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>

<p>Rather than Wukong himself, you control the Destined One, a distinctly simian warrior whose destiny is to follow in the footsteps of the legendary trickster god. Along the way, you'll meet plenty of colorful characters and visit lots of beautiful locations inspired by classical Chinese mythology.</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike, so you can expect tough boss fights and plenty of semi-linear exploration, although the game goes a little easier on the difficulty than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The physical version of the PS5 release is due to arrive on December 12th.
