			<p>Not even three weeks ago from the time of this writing, <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">announced that it had voted for a wall-to-wall union and joined CWA Canada.</a> Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">covered the announcement</a>, as it was the latest and one of the final bits of news regarding the continued labour movement in the video game industry in 2025. Now, 20 days after Ubisoft Halifax announced its successful union vote, Ubisoft has shut down the studio, with <strong>71 developers set to lose their jobs<em>.</em></strong></p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/">VGC</a>, which obtained an email sent to Ubisoft Halifax staff informing them of the closure, claiming the decision was made as part of Ubisoft's efforts within the last 24 months "<em>to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>."   </p>



<p>Shortly after the news was made public, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-long-0438b7174_ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-activity-7414702213182222336-KkuI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">several members</a> of Ubisoft Halifax <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-clarke-ux-research_opentowork-activity-7414701237566300160-nUyA?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">confirmed the news</a> via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgegreer123_ubisoft-halifax-is-being-shut-down-if-anyone-activity-7414680117597245440-duoJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">posts on their personal LinkedIn profiles</a>. The studio had just celebrated its 10-year anniversary after its founding in 2015.</p>



<p>According to the initial report, the decision to close the Halifax studio was not made as a result of the team unionizing, and the choice was made "<em>well before</em>" 60 of the studio's staff joined the CWA Canada in its successful union vote. At the time of this writing, there's been no official statement from Ubisoft on the shuttering, though CWA Canada has made a short statement on social media, with an official statement informed by conversations with the staff at Ubisoft Halifax to follow. </p>



<p>"<em>CWA Canada is shocked and disappointed at this outrageous damaging decision by Ubisoft</em>," CWA Canada <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mbtvhfk5ak2v">writes in their post on Bluesky</a>. "<em>We are speaking with legal counsel, and we will do everything possible to fight this. We will have a full statement after we have consulted with our Ubisoft members.</em>"</p>







<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a statement and will update this article if/when we receive a response. </p>

            <p>
Ubisoft are closing Ubisoft Halifax, the Canadian developers of mobile games Rainbow Six Mobile and Assassin's Creed Rebellion. This is strictly speaking outside our mandate as a PC gaming site, of course - I fear smartphones like Hell itself, and only ever communicate over long distances using homing pigeons - but it's all part of Ubisoft's wider transformation into a heavily Tencent-backed publisher, and the nasty twist is that Ubisoft Halifax had only just voted to unionise.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Ubisoft Halifax staff announced the founding of Ubisoft's first labour union in North America earlier this week, having begun the process in June 2025. Almost 74% of the studio's staff voted in favour, spanning the programming, production, design, art and R&amp;D departments. The vote was actually due to take place last June, but Ubisoft mounted challenges that were ultimately dropped ahead of vote-counting in December.
</p>
<p>
In announcement materials, the freshly unionised Halifax staff appeared positive about their relationship with the company. "We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered," they wrote. "We are unionising not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation."
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft have binned them off, though they've stressed to GI that this has nothing to do with unionisation. "Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," the company said in a statement. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance." 
</p><p>
According to an Ubisoft spokesperson, the closure forms part of cost-cutting that dates back to the lifting of Covid restrictions and the end of the pandemic revenue boom. They remain happy to recognise and work with unionised staff in general. It should of course be noted that there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">plenty of unionised Ubisoft staff in other regions</a>, but still, I'm not sure burning down a subsidiary within days of unionisation indicates strong desire for a healthy dialogue with the workers.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Halifax weren't always a mobile-dedicated studio. Prior to their acquisition by the House of Guillemot in 2015, they were known as Longtail and worked on guitar game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocksmith">Rocksmith</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following a rough couple of years defined by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">plummeting stock prices and shareholder uprisings</a>, Ubisoft are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded core "creative house"</a>, shoring up their core <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six operations while trimming the books elsewhere. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced plans for redundancies</a> at Massive, creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, together with a change of direction for Trials devs Redlynx.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all Ubisoft Halifax staff now looking for new jobs.

              <p><span>Razer, the company best known for its RGB-infused keyboards, cat-ear headsets, and over-priced gaming chairs, has just revealed that its “AI gaming copilot” Project Ava will be used in its latest invention: an AI anime waifu that sits on your desk, named “Kira.” She’ll be powered by Elon Musk’s Grok.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show kicked off in Las Vegas this week and, unsurprisingly, AI-powered tech is everywhere. Razer announced its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach"><span>AI gaming assistant, Project Ava,</span></a><span> at last year’s show, alongside a prerecorded video of the copilot program suggesting tips to help a player navigate a boss fight in </span><i><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Razer’s Project Ava has now returned in physical form. The newly unveiled “AI Desk Companion” version comes equipped with a built-in webcam (which Razer states is for its “human-like vision” and “full contextual awareness”), a series of customizable RGB LEDs, a USB-C port, and, most notably, a “swappable” 5.5-inch-tall 3D holographic avatar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Razer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Razer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/ah54Us7QMJ">pic.twitter.com/ah54Us7QMJ</a></p> <p>— Shacknews (@shacknews) <a href="https://twitter.com/shacknews/status/2008539048328171561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the press release, Project Ava’s holographic companion currently comes in five varieties. These include the default, amorphous green blob Ava, the aforementioned cat-ear wearing anime waifu Kira, and a buff “gaming wingman” called Zane. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The other two holograms are actually 3D recreations of real people: the South Korean eSports legend Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and the J-Pop idol Saori “Sao” Araki, the latter of whom exploded in popularity last year following her viral “Office Lady” meme.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sony-razer-project-ava-ai-gameplay"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, the physical version of Project Ava will be powered by xAI’s Grok, which recently </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrn054nxe7o"><span>started posting CSAM online</span></a><span>. If you’re curious how it will perform as Grok races </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><span>to seed social media with deepfake porn</span></a><span>, several outlets, including </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/razer-made-its-ai-gaming-assistant-into-a-waifu-hologram-2000705679"><span>both </span><i><span>Gizmodo</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>, were less than complimentary about its implementation.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>Gizmodo’s </span></i><span>James Pero stated that his experience with Project Ava was “as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there,” and </span><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i><span> Antonio G. Di Benedetto noted that the anime AI assistant Kira “kept incessantly filling gaps in communication with annoying chatter.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’re still keen to get your hands on one of these regardless, </span><a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava"><span>the FAQ</span></a><span> on Razer’s Project Ava website states that it’s “expected to be available in the second half of 2026” and that folks in the United States can already reserve one of the units by putting down a $20 deposit. The company still hasn’t revealed how much the full Grok-powered holograms will cost.</span></p>

With a mix of action-RPG combat and turn-based mechanics, its unique blend crafts an experience not seen in other JRPGs. Plus, with new and returning characters and updated graphics, Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter is primed to be one of the biggest RPGs in 2026. Its Fall 2026 release also means those who haven’t played Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter have plenty of time to catch up.</p>

<p>A stylized remake of the 2000 classic, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined takes the iconic RPG series in a new direction. Taking on a diorama look with 3D doll looks for its cast of characters, the game delivers the fun and whimsy of Dragon Quest. Following an unnamed hero, you’ll travel with a ragtag group of adventurers to distant islands to ward off evil. Sporting the signature turn-based combat and the late Akira Toriyama’s art design, the fresh take is one fans have already fallen in love with. New story content and many changes to the flow and additional classes make Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined the perfect RPG to get lost in.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the successful soft reboot, Dynasty Warriors: Origins under its belt, Koei Tecmo is remastering one of the earlier entries in the series: Dynasty Warriors 3. The game, which was released in 2001, is considered a favorite among fans and critics, as its excellent hack-and-slash gameplay and visuals were a treat. Taking place after Dynasty Warriors 2, players will play as over 40 officers during the Three Kingdoms era. Given the advancements made since its initial release, including Origins’ 1000 v 1 combat and Unreal Engine 5, it’ll feel like a whole new game. With the series growing in popularity, Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition Remastered is a great way to dive in and have some sword-slashing fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Tecmo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2000s were great for the horror genre, but one series made waves in Japan and later in the West: Fatal Frame. While new entries haven’t happened since 2014, a remake of the second title, 2003’s Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, will suffice. Following twin sisters Mio and Mayu, the two become trapped in a ghost-infested, cursed town and are forced to recreate the ritual that summoned the hex. Using your Camera Obscura, you’ll solve puzzles, locate important items, and kill dangerous ghosts. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake will bring plenty of spooks and scares to satisfy even the bravest, and it should be a worthwhile addition to your library—if you’re brave enough!</p>

As Master Chief, you’ll take the fight to the Covenant and uncover the secrets of the Halo ring. With fine-tuned FPS gameplay and many modern-day adaptations, it makes for a wonderful 25th anniversary celebration. It looks to be a very promising return to Halo Combat Evolved and the game that started it all for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Released in 2003, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time rebooted the ‘platformer’ for a new generation. Now, the classic game is getting a next-gen remake thanks to Ubisoft Montreal. Following a nameless Prince, you’ll use the power of time manipulation to stop the evil Vizier from taking over the world. It’s been in development hell for quite some time, changing studios and such. However, a promised 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a> gives hope to the many fans: Perhaps the Prince’s famed journey will see the light of day again.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to MAGES. Inc</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Steins:Gate took many by surprise in 2009 with its genre balance and spectacular twists and turns. Fortunately for fans of the game and acclaimed anime, the visual novel series is getting the remake treatment.

As scientist Rintaro Okabe, you and your group discover and develop a machine that can change the past with dire consequences. With branching narratives, there’s a lot of content that you’ll get to enjoy, whether a newcomer or a returning fan.</p>

                <p>Some collectors will stop at nothing to complete their collections, even if that means decades have to pass before ever finishing. One such collector was on such a journey, finding and acquiring every Xbox 360 game released, and at the start of this year, that collector has finally finished this now vintage library that totals around $20,000--with the last game being a gift from their son.</p><p>Redditor uncleseeth <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q2gdxs/comment/nxcufdh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their massive library</a> in a post on the r/gaming subreddit on January 2. Starting the collection after receiving their Xbox 360 and Neversoft's Western shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gun/" data-ref-id="5000-21435">Gun</a> on Christmas Day in 2005, uncleseeth then went on a mad hunt for every single game ever released on Microsoft's seventh-generation console. From standard editions to different variants, uncleseeth said their collection topped at 1,353 games--well over the 1,256 needed for a "complete set," which doesn't include the variants of various games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Best Games You Missed In 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Some games and items were given as gifts, including Efecto Studios' racer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-chavo-kart/" data-ref-id="5000-245779">El Chavo Kart</a> and the Xbox stand. One game that shocked them to find was The Farm 51's action-adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadfall-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-172682">Deadfall Adventures</a>, which they described as "kinda [having] Indiana Jones vibes."</p><p>But the final title they were missing was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2018/" data-ref-id="5000-464889">Pro Evolution Soccer 2018</a>, which was gifted to them by their son. With that in their possession, the collection was complete and totals roughly $20,000, as the games are estimated to resell for about $15 each after two decades. That said, there is one expensive game in the bunch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f1-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-187692">F1 2013</a>, which uncleseeth approximated is going for $250 or so.</p><p>With an Xbox 360 Elite--their first Xbox 360 got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the dreaded Red Ring of Death</a>--and a total gamerscore of 497,000, uncleseeth's next goal is to continue chasing more variants and play through the entire library. They said they've played about 800 of the games but only completed roughly 175 of them. That's a lot of games to play.</p>

<p>Don't worry, we had to Google it too. For those wondering, 'Pokécology' is the study of Pokémon based on their assigned habitats. It all stems from Yoshinari Yonehara's <strong>Pokécology: An Illustrated Guide to Pokémon Ecology</strong>, the best-selling Japanese Pokémon book, which, conveniently, will be getting an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/preorder-the-upcoming-book-pokecology-an-illustrated-guide-to-pokemon-ecology">English translation</a> later this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fiwqkjm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>What this means for the merch is a whole lot of dino vibes. The Pokémon Company has already revealed a handful of pieces you can expect to find if you're lucky enough to hold a ticket to the pop-up store (now sold out), including a dinosaur Pokémon print, special pins, a research notes Pikachu tote, and a plushie of that same Electric Type hugging the museum itself.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also revealed a special oversized TCG promo card to mark the collaboration, which shows Pikachu walking the museum's iconic central hall. This card will be available from select UK retailers from 30th January.</p>
<p>All of this merch and more will be available in the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop from 26th Jan - 19th April.</p>
<p>For those who couldn't snag a ticket to the collaboration, TPC has confirmed that a selection of the exclusive items will be available on both The Pokémon Center and the Natural History Museum's online stores — just brace yourselves for the dreaded 'Sold Out' messages...</p>
<p>On a related note, The Pokémon Company yesterday shared more details on London's <em>other</em> upcoming pop-up store at next month's European International Championships. Gosh, it's a hell of a time to be nursing that post-holiday bank balance.</p>

            <p>
A few years ago, it would have been pretty easy to imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> releasing as a free-to-play game. It is a live service game after all, most of those are free-to-play because studios want to reduce the barrier to entry. Instead, it launched as a paid-for, $40 game, a far cry from free, but not the $80-$100 releases we're seeing more and more of. And it's because Arrowhead made the decision to do so that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark did the exact same thing for their own shooter.
</p>
<p>
This comes from Embark founder Patrick Söderlund who spoke of the studio's decision to shift the game from free-to-play to paid-for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-from-the-finals-devs-is-no-longer-free-to-play-and-coming-2025">in 2024</a> in an interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi. "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" Söderlund said. ""We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Apparently, the game's lack of a campaign was a factor as well, with Söderlund noting he wouldn't want a high price tag to "be an offender for someone. We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."
</p><p>
Certainly seems like it paid off for Embark, given that Arc Raiders was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-ancient-behemoths-face-increased-competition-from-new-games-in-the-stores-2025-money-making-rankings">apparently one of the best performing games of 2025</a>, so, I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing more campaign-less, online shooters going the premium route in future. Like, for example, Bungie's yet to prove itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-lives-as-bungie-set-a-march-release-date-and-try-to-convince-you-the-extraction-shooter-is-good-now">which has also opted for the 40 bucks option</a>.

            <p>Ghost Ship Games could learn a thing or two from Rockstar about hiding secrets in cobwebs. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-let-red-dead-redemption-2s-unsolved-ancient-spiderweb-mystery-end-by-revealing-that-rdr2-is-a-spiders-dream">RDR2’s spider-spun mystery</a> continues to vex seasoned easter egg hunters, the message behind a piece of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a> promo art – posted on the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/drg">Discord server</a> earlier today – was seemingly spotted in about twenty minutes. Still, at least it looks to be a handy bit of info: a release date for its big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-unearths-its-season-6-update-as-rogue-core-spinoff-gets-delayed">Season 6 update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's the image in question, and while I confess to having initially blanked on it when it buzzed onto my phone – obviously I want up-to-the-minute alerts on all dwarf FPS news – more observant mining enthusiasts on the same Discord quickly spotted the hints. A '29' wrapped in the dangling webs. An '01' carved into the jaw of a long-dead alien colossus. And finally, a '26' stamped on the laser-cutting rocket booster shown hauling a valuable rock through other, less valuable rocks.</p>
<figure>

<p>Put them together in the correct day/month/year format, and you get the 29th of January 2026, well within Season 6’s previously given 'Q1 26' estimate. Depending on the angle, you could maybe say the 29 is actually a 62, but I asked Edwin if there’s a month with 62 days in it and he said no, and Edwin is really smart so I believe him.</p><p>To recap what we know, Season 6 has been in development at Ghost Ship’s Copenhagen neighbours Invisible Walls, while the former focus on getting roguelike spinoff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> into early access. Despite the outsourcing, OG Deep Rock’s first seasonal update since mid-2024 is shaping up to be a big one, with new xenobugs to fight, a new, skeleton-ridden biome to plunder, and a new mineral extraction mission type, an artist’s rendition of which forms that teaser image.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to it! Last night I played DRG for the first time in about a month and a half, and while it absolutely has that semi-timeless quality a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">great co-op games</a> have, it would be nice to switch up both the cave locales and the opposing force of insectoids. If that’s only three weeks plus change away, all the better.</p>

              <p>Christmas might be over, but that won’t stop retailers and digital stores from offering up deals themed around wintertime. Case in point: GOG’s big new Winter Classics Promo, which features over 1,000 heavily discounted old PC games.</p> <p>Kicking off on January 6, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20260106-winter-classics-promo?order=desc:trending">the new GOG Winter Classics Promo</a> sees the storefront dedicated to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">selling and preserving games</a>, offering up some of its older titles for up to 95 percent off. The sale runs from now until January 20, and given the weather, it is a good time to curl up with some classic PC games under a warm blanket and have a cozy night. As always, games bought on GOG don’t feature any DRM or the need to download a launcher or digital app. You just buy it, download it, install it, and play it.</p> <p>So here are some of the highlights from this massive GOG sale.</p> <ul> <li><em>Theme Hospital – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 3 GOTY Edition – $7 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout New Vegas – $10 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 4: GOTY Edition – $16 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper GOLD – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper 2 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 – $5 (10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 2000 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 3000 – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 4 – $5 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Thief Gold – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 2 – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 3 – $1.80 ($9)</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor War Chest – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Ultima Underworld 1-2 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Jade Empire – $4 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Syberia – $1.30 ($13)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 1-3 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 4-6 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry 2 – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Spore Collection – $30 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Torchlight 2 – $4 ($20)</em></li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752</link>
            <guid>1399618</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax, the Nova Scotia-based mobile team in Ubisoft’s stable of studios, announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"><span>it was unionizing back in December</span></a><span>. Ubisoft swears up and down that what came next was decided before 61 of its 71 employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, and if that’s actually the case, Ubisoft sure stepped on a massive rake by shutting down the studio just weeks after organizing members made the union official.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/"><i><span>Gamesindustry.biz</span></i></a><span>, Ubisoft said the call came not from a cruel union-busting effort, but as part of years-long cost-cutting initiative on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> company’s part.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” the statement reads. “As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if this is the case, the optics are bad. Ubisoft has been undergoing a lot of reorganization in the past few years, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>layoffs at subsidiaries like </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws </span></i><span>developer Massive</span></a><span> and top level personnel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542"><span>leaving the company</span></a><span> as it continues to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161"><span>drastically reduce its workforce</span></a><span> after Tencent bailed it out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796"><span>to the tune of $1.25 billion</span></a><span>. So yeah, it might not be union busting, but the whole thing still deserves your “boos” and tomatoes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax had developed two free-to-play games based on some of Ubisoft’s biggest properties:</span><i><span> Rainbow Six Mobile </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</span></i><span>. It’s unclear how this will affect </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Mobile</span></i><span>, which was set for a global release on February 23. </span></p>

<p>Mojang have unveiled the first Minecraft Snapshot of 2026, and it’s easily one of the most wholesome ones they’ve revealed yet. Multiple changes have been made to numerous baby mobs, and they’re bound to steal fans’ hearts. </p>



<p>The most notable change made in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecrafts-mounts-of-mayhem-update-is-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a> 26.1 Snapshot 2 is the retexturing of multiple baby mobs. These younger mobs will now better reflect their adult variant textures, and some of them will even make new baby sounds. </p>



<p>Another change that fans have long been calling for is the introduction of craftable Name Tags. No longer must they be found in chests or fished up by chance; instead, fans can now reliably craft them and name mobs to their heart’s desire—all it costs is one Paper and any Metal Nugget.</p>



<p>Check out the full patch notes for Minecraft 26.1 Snapshot 2 below, and leave your thoughts on the changes down in the comments, as well as in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>PlayStation has just revealed a new collection of Hyperpop DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers, featuring three colourways.</p>



<p>It is finally time for PlayStation players to add some new colours to their lives, and the three new designs really know how to stand out. It has been quite some time since we received a new collection of PS5 accessories, and a brand-new colourway after the Chroma and Metallic collections was long overdue.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-hyperpop-collection-releases-in-march-2026">PlayStation Hyperpop Collection Releases in March 2026</h2>



<p>PlayStation’s Hyperpop Collection adds three new colourways to the DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers. These are Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue. All three colourways follow a similar aesthetic, starting with a glossy black and shifting into vivid neons of their respective colours. Check out the gallery below to see the Hyperpop Collection DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers: </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-preview-face-beauty-and-danger-atop-the-worlds-most-dangerous-mountain</link>
            <guid>1399603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, famed British mountaineer George Mallory famously offered the simple reply, "Because it’s there.” After several hours playing through an exclusive, hands-on demo of Cairn, the upcoming climbing-survival sim from The Game Bakers, I’m beginning to understand what ol’ George was on about. My time on the mountain was filled with arduous climbs punctuated with periods of quiet reflection, life-or-death battles against the elements, and a combined sense of victory and wonder as I reached higher and higher. Tape those fingers, chalk your hands, and get ready to dig in; this climb will be a test of wits and endurance. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get a Grip</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I stand at the base of a stone wall as small cracks and ledges pockmark the surface. I tentatively reach up a hand to grab a chest-high hold, and begin to slowly hoist myself up the face of the cliff. I’m working slowly and cautiously through the day and into the night, fearful to make a wrong move and plunge to my death. There are a few tense moments as my arms begin to shake, a telltale-sign that they are ready to give out, but, with a carefully placed belay for safety, I make it to the top. There, under a canopy of stars, I see Mt. Kami in the distance, a towering and ferocious summit as yet untamed by mountaineers, and our goal on this climb. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cairn Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The deliberate, highly-manual control of climbing reminds me a bit of Manual Samuel, or even QWOP, where the challenge lies in your ability to precisely control each limb. However, while games like that ratchet up the struggle as you fight with your intentionally obtuse and flailing character, in Cairn, Aava is your partner, and a highly skilled one. While the majority of control is in the player's hand, she makes the connection to the cliff itself, and seems to be smart about her grips.  Place one of her hands on an outcropping and she will grab on, slide a leg towards a narrow crack and she will wedge her foot in as best she can. It feels like a 90-10 sharing of responsibility, and as I ascended up the face of Mount Kami, I couldn’t help but feel a level of trust with Aava that grew with each leg of the climb. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Maybe you can buy time by shaking out an exhausted hand or leg, but you will ultimately need to get to a firm and sustainable position, or risk losing hold entirely, and joining the untold number of climbers that never made it back from their attempt to scale Mount Kami.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an ebb and flow to the climbing. Sometimes, clear hand and footholds make for a fast and controlled ascent. Often, though, the path isn’t so clear or friendly, and I have to make due with wedging a foot against a flat surface, or gripping around the outside corner of a rock, taking advantage of Aava’s crushing grip strength when there’s no edge to take hold of. These work temporarily, but exertion quickly expends energy. Small shakes in limbs giving way to tremors and audible sounds of distress indicate these grips are about to break. Maybe you can buy time by shaking out an exhausted hand or leg, but you will ultimately need to get to a firm and sustainable position, or risk losing hold entirely, and joining the untold number of climbers that never made it back from their attempt to scale Mount Kami. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A core promise of Cairn is that you can essentially climb anywhere, that all of the rock face is your playground. However, you don’t just stick to surfaces like a tree frog the way Link does in Breath of the Wild; picking your route is essential to ensure you have the cracks and other holds necessary to make headway. Calling the climbing a puzzle would be reductive, it’s more like a toybox filled with puzzles for you to choose from. There’s no yellow paint to mark the path, but you can pull the camera out for a wide view to help with the decision making (and enjoy the gorgeous vista while you are at it.) Sometimes it’s a straightforward choice, like a slower, but easier route, or a faster, but more challenging course. But often it’s more complex than that, with options that mix tough segments in different orders, or appear easy overall save for a section that doesn't have a clear path, and you’ll just need to figure it out when you get there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, Aava has more than just her physical prowess to assist with her climb. Climbot is her trusty robot companion, following close behind and carrying an end of Aava’s climbing rope. By driving a piton into the rock, she can build a belay, loop the rope through the piton to the bot, catching her if she falls, and allowing her to lean off the cliff to rest, or rappel down. There’s a limited supply, but once you reach a flat section, Climbot can collect the piton to use again. These are really handy for saving progress on long climbs, and can be literal life savers, especially if used before heading into particularly tricky sections. They do take a bit of time to set properly, though, which I learned the hard way when I realized too late that I was going to lose my grip and hadn’t secured myself to the mountain. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Live to Climb Another Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve reached the top of a few cliff faces now, and am growing more confident. I’m climbing faster, and reading the surface of the mountain more clearly, making better choices about which routes to take. As I near the top of another climb, I spot some scribbles on the wall, a drawing and  message from a young climber who came this way. I pull myself up and prepare to make camp when another Climbot, similar to mine but badly damaged, drags itself into view before breaking down entirely. Its solo descent from some untold altitude, with no sign of its owner, tells the grim story of what likely transpired. A short while later, I come around a bend near a waterfall, and find the remains of a climber. Aava kneels down over her fallen comrade, telling them gently, “Sometimes you come for the mountain. Sometimes the mountain comes for you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mt. Kami is a dangerous place, particularly for a solo climber. As you climb you face the ever-present threat of a deadly fall, but that’s not all the mountain has to throw at you. Cold weather can sap your strength and health, rain can erode your grip, while storms and nightfall rob you of visibility. You’ll also need to stay fed and hydrated to survive, and tend to physical wear and tear of Aava’s hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, this mountain isn’t all sheer walls and rocky outcroppings. Long climbs are punctuated with terraces, flat areas part way up the mountain, and caves offering a respite from the ascent. Here, temporary campsites called Bivouacs offer a place to save and pitch your tent. Nestled in her shelter, Aava is protected from the elements, and can cook meals on her stove, sort through her pack, and catch up on some much-needed rest to restore her health. This is also a good time to prepare for what’s next by taping up bloody fingers and preparing warm food and drink to better endure dropping temperatures. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a long climb, and will take more resources than can fit in a single backpack. While you can occasionally grab edible plants mid-climb, it’s these terraces and caves where scavenging opportunities really present themselves. Streams, waterfalls, and ponds can refill your canteen, while local flora and fauna, like dandelions and fish, afford a chance to gather things to cook or eat. Bear-proof boxes or abandoned supplies might be right in front of you, other times you need to stray off the beaten path and explore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Call of the Mountain</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m now four days into this ascent, and I feel like I must be thousands of feet above where I started. I’m climbing extremely well now, finding narrow footholds and recognizing more ways to maintain my grip, but there’s something going on with Aava. I can’t quite put my finger on what, but there’s more to it than just trying to be the first to tame Mount Kami. Her agent has called a few times via Climbot, but she’s ignored him enough times that it seems less funny, more intentional. She was cheery enough following a message from friends with some well wishes, but when the smile faded, she looked more pained than pleased. I keep thinking back to a moment after Climbot plays back a message from Aava’s partner, some innocent updates about the going-ons back home. The way she turns to her mechanical companion, no offer of thanks or a smile, instead rebuking it with, “Happy now robot? You’ve ruined everything.” Something isn’t right, and I don’t know what.<strong> </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We might see some other climbers on our ascent...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Cairn seems to be about the journey and struggle of the climb, don’t take that to mean that story takes a back seat. The Game Bakers have been<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cairn-official-developer-overview-trailer-women-led-games-x-sgf-2025"><u> clear that we might see some other climbers on our ascent</u></a>, and, while what I’ve seen has mostly been the focused solitude of one person’s fight against gravity, the bits of dialogue from Aava and audio playback from Climbot have contributed enough pieces to the narrative mosaic in my three hours or so that I’m starting to get a better sense of who Aava is, and that whatever is driving this death-defying climb is something she’s willing to risk her life for. But I don’t know why, and every time I pull myself farther up the mountain it’s with the hope that it’s pulling me a bit closer to finding out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Mount Kami itself. These often sheer, jagged cliffs give off an unmistakable hostility, but the waterways and greenery give it an undeniable serenity at times too. There’s a complex identity and history to this mountain, one that’s uncovering the further I climb. At one point in my demo I came across cave-dwellings that had been carefully sculpted into multiple homes and common areas, with a few abandoned writings that helped understand the people who lived there, and a bit of their relationships with the adventurers who came through. Later, a covered shelf acting as a platform for some abandoned tents, with journals wondering about the presence of bears, gives me a sense of dread about why they are abandoned and what might be waiting ahead. A broken cable car and toppled-over vending machine (with some convenient snacks) help fill in the story told of a place that was once more accessible and open to the world, but has since become more closed off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As my time with the Cairn demo comes to an end I find myself thinking more about Mount Kami, about how I could approach every area I climbed differently the next time, and what awaits farther up. I’m invested in the story, but just as intrigued in the idea of talking to friends about their routes and watching others take on the mountain, especially those brave enough to challenge the piton-less, permadeath Free-Solo difficulty. Fortunately, I won’t need to wait much longer to test the mountain again, Cairn plants its flag on PS5 and PC on January 29th. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-preview-face-beauty-and-danger-atop-the-worlds-most-dangerous-mountain]]></content:encoded>

                <p>StarCraft may be set for a comeback, with a new report indicating a third-person shooter set in Blizzard's sci-fi franchise will be revealed at this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/" data-ref-id="1100-6535959">BlizzCon</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central's</a> Jez Corden on what to expect from Xbox this year, a StarCraft shooter could headline Blizzard's fan convention in September.</p><p dir="ltr">Details about the game, including whether or not it will be a multiplayer title, are light, but it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-trying-to-make-a-starcraft-shooter-again/1100-6526763/" data-ref-id="1100-6526763">first reported</a> to exist in 2024 by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schrierer in his book Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Former Far Cry lead Dan Hay is said to be leading the project. Corden said he's confirmed the game's existence with his own sources, but did not share any additional information on what the game will look like.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be the first time Blizzard has tried to get a StarCraft shooter off the ground. Blizzard somewhat infamously axed a third-person shooter spin-off titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-ghost-see-the-leaked-footage-of-blizzard/1100-6473774/" data-ref-id="1100-6473774">StarCraft: Ghost</a> in the mid-2000s: one that would have seen players in the boots of a "Ghost" and set after the events of StarCraft's Brood War expansion. While the game was missing in action for years, it took until 2014 for then Blizzard president Mike Morhaime to officially confirm the game had been canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Though StarCraft has been mostly dormant at Blizzard for the last decade (the last campaign pack for the game released in 2016) it has popped up in other Blizzard games in the forms of various crossovers. Blizzard recently offered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-takes-to-the-stars-with-starcraft-crossover/1100-6535039/" data-ref-id="1100-6535039">StarCraft-themed skins in Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-2025-roadmap-includes-starcraft-crossover-and-a-return-to-ungoro-crater/1100-6527722/" data-ref-id="1100-6527722">Hearthstone received an entire StarCraft-themed card set</a> at the beginning of last year.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what other announcements fans can expect at BlizzCon 2026, Corden reports it's likely another Diablo 4 expansion will be announced just six months after the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-brings-back-everyones-favorite-hot-mom-amazons-and-lorath/1100-6536976/" data-ref-id="1100-6536976">Lord of Hatred</a>, as well as new details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-starcraft-shooter-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">World of Warcraft's</a> The Last Titan expansion and what's next for Overwatch.</p>

                <p>There's no shortage of handheld gaming PCs to choose from lately, but the Steam Deck has been a popular option thanks in part to its operating system. SteamOS works far better than Windows on these machines, and fortunately, it's available on another device: Lenovo's Legion Go 2. The company recently rolled out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6534509/" data-ref-id="1100-6534509">Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, but for anyone looking for a handheld with more heavy-duty hardware--and Switch-like controllers--the Legion Go 2 has been a solid option. Lenovo will start selling the Legion Go 2 with SteamOS preinstalled in June, with pricing starting at $1,199.</p><p>Preorders aren't open at the time of writing, but it's likely that you'll find a listing at Best Buy and Amazon soon for the Legion Go 2. Compared to other PC gaming handhelds, the Legion Go 2 offers a lot of technical bang for your buck. The premium model is powered by the AMD Z2 Extreme chip, has 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 74Wh battery. The base model uses the AMD Z2 SoC, has 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the same battery.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631728" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631728"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go 2 SteamOS</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg"></figure><p>Both models also share one of the best screens you can find on a gaming handheld in the form of an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display. This has a 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, making games look vibrant and smooth. The detachable TrueStrike controllers are also a big draw, and you can use them to shift between handheld, tabletop, console, or FPS modes.</p><p>SteamOS isn't just a smoother operating system; it offers a performance boost thanks to its optimization. The trade-off is that you'll be locked to a Steam library, as the Windows 11 handhelds allow you to load up several storefronts in addition to Steam. If you don't mind the clunky experience of using Windows on a much smaller screen, you can still pick up a Legion Go 2 running Windows 11 from Best Buy, or if you don't mind a lower-specced device, you can save $100 on the compact Legion Go S.</p><ul><li><strong>Lenovo Windows PC Gaming Handhelds</strong><ul><li><a

<p>Ubisoft Halifax was formerly known as Longtail Studios. Founded in 2010, it worked on Rocksmith 2014 before being <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/10/14/ubisoft-purchases-studio-that-worked-on-rocksmith-2014.aspx">acquired by Ubisoft in 2015</a>. The studio went on to help develop the mobile titles <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_rebellion/b/ios/archive/2017/06/27/build-your-own-assassin-brotherhood-in-the-new-free-to-play-strategy-rpg.aspx">Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</a>, released in 2018, and Rainbow Six Mobile, which launches on February 23.&nbsp;</p><p>This news follows a challenging couple of years for the publisher, which has made significant cuts at studios such as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-massive-initiates-voluntary-buyouts">Massive Entertainment</a> (The Division, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora) and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">RedLynx</a> (Trials) as part of its ongoing restructuring. Last March, it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">formed a new subsidiary</a> partially backed by Tencent called Vantage Studios to manage its biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio]]></content:encoded>

			<p>After <strong>Bethesda</strong> gave The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion the Unreal Engine 5 remaster treatment with <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, both <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong> are due for the same treatment "<em>eventually</em>."</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've had reports pointing to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 getting some kind of remake/remaster treatment. This is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/">the second time in the span of the last few months</a> that Windows Central has claimed a remaster/remake similar to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is on its way for two of the most beloved Fallout games. </p>



<p>That said, Windows Central is not the only source for these claims. <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Other outlets have reported</a> that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">remasters/remakes are in development</a>, and considering the booming success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a>, and the commercial success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">it was one of the top 12 best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>), it feels like it's just a matter of time before Bethesda proves the rumours and reports to be correct with an official announcement.</p>



<p>"<em>Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told that is not the case</em>," Corden writes. "<em>However, we are <strong>eventually</strong> getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein</em> <em>of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top</em>."</p>



<p>So while there's no apparent timeline for when these remasters/remakes will be announced and released, all signs point to them happening. Hopefully, we'll have some official announcements soon.</p>

              <p>Oh great gaming gods, hear our prayer: Please may 2026 prove to be the year in which the AI bubble bursts. Amen. A rather splendid sign of at least one big-name tech company backing away from the bullshit claims comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/dells-ces-2026-chat-was-the-most-pleasingly-un-ai-briefing-ive-had-in-maybe-5-years/">a <em>PC Gamer</em> interview</a> with Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, who outright stated that consumers just don’t care about AI, and aren’t drawn in by its addition to products.</p> <p>“What we’ve learned over the course of this year,” says Terwilliger to&nbsp;<em>PCG</em>‘s Dave James, “especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI. In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”</p>

 <p>This is not to say that Dell is backing away from AI as a feature within its tech (baby steps), but rather is just avoiding mentioning the topic during its latest raft of announcements during CES 2026. James reports that the Dell presentation from vice chairman Jeff Clarke only mentioned the near-meaningless two letters once, and in a pejorative fashion, saying “we have this un-met promise of AI.” Instead, the speech focused on new laptops and desktop computers, the challenges of tariffs, and some shiny new monitors. You know, like hardware manufacturers used to do.</p>

 <p>So when Dave James spoke to Dell’s Kevin Terwilliger, he brought up how conspicuous the topic was in its absence, given the tedious ubiquity of the subject for the last few years. “One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Terwilliger told <em>PCG</em>. “So a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”</p>

 <p>What strikes me most about this is not the lack of being AI-forward, but the willingness to call out that it was dumb to have been so in 2025. While he adds that “we’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device,” the change in emphasis feels very significant.</p>

 <p>The reality is, “AI” as a term means so many different things in so many different circumstances that it’s useless. For decades, in gaming, it was the term used to describe the programmed behavior of NPCs, until it was clumsily repurposed by companies like OpenAI, Google, and X to instead be shorthand for “generative-AI” like LLMs, the plagiarism machines that are fed all the content of the internet and then regurgitate it in slightly different, significantly less accurate forms. But when computer manufacturers use it, it’s something else all over again, software that “learns” based on experience, allowing for high-speed adjustments to ideally improve performance. In that sense, it’s somewhat more like the algorithms being used in scientific research to dramatically speed up fields like medical research, also usually just called “AI.”</p>

 <p>So hurrah to Dell for being bold enough to back away from the bullshit. May it be the first of very many, as we start to see “AI” exposed as the grift it truly has become, and hopefully a new emphasis on celebrating creativity and originality, whether it’s aided by AI-driven GPUs or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems that ID Software might be returning to one of the most famous franchises under its belt, Quake. </p>



<p>The Quake series is one of the most popular franchises in gaming, redefining how the industry approaches first-person shooters. However, it’s been a very long time since we saw a new Quake instalment, with the latest being Quake Champions, along with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quake-2-remaster-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enhanced versions of older titles</a>, so it’s high time we received a new game. </p>







<h2 id="h-id-software-rumoured-to-return-to-quake-or-hexen">ID Software Rumoured to Return to Quake or Hexen</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, which talks about Xbox’s plans in 2026, discusses the rumours about ID Software returning to Quake or Hexen, as Microsoft now owns all the rights to both franchises. There’s a chance that we could hear about these games at Bethesda’s Quakecon event; however, if it is a big reveal, then it might be featured during the Xbox Showcase. Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it’s just a rumour. </p>



<p>As mentioned above, the last Quake game was Quake Champions, a free-to-play title that was released in 2022. However, the previous mainline Hexen game was Hexen 2, released in 1997. At the last QuakeCon, definitive versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders and Hexen: Beyond Heretic were released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch. However, we haven’t received a new mainline instalment in close to three decades. </p>







<p>In other news, Doom: The Dark Ages was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-id-software-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch</a> in ID Software’s history. Additionally, read about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Year in Review story</a>, which talks about Bethesda having to go back to the drawing board after Doom: The Dark Ages.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why Clair Obscur Expedition 33 Is GameSpot's Game of the Year 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content," Nohra said. "And that's something I underestimated, which made people [who] wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p><p>Lead programmer Tom Guillermin echoed Nohra's sentiment, saying it was a "surprise" that so many players opted to do and see everything Clair Obscur had to offer rather than just mainlining the game's story. Guillermin chalked this up to "humility," as the developers didn't think they had a hit on their hands.</p><p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin says. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon. We're happy about that, but we didn't see it coming."</p><p>If there was one regret, Nohra said the team could've been clearer about the intended difficulty for the final boss, explaining that players should've gone to "beat it down now" instead of overleveling with side content. That didn't impact the opinions on the game, though, as Clair Obscur reviewed very well and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">broke The Game Awards' trophy-snatching record with nine awards</a>.</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-game-of-the-year-winners-to-date/2900-7352/#6" data-ref-id="2900-7352">joins a growing list of GOTY winners</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" data-ref-id="5000-483352">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>.

Its sequel debuted exclusively on iOS three years later before shuffling onto Android a few months after. Then, in 2024, ustwo decided to partner with Netflix for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> instead, making for a second (and more significant) collaboration after launching </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Desta: The Memories Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a temporary Netflix exclusive in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sayans explains that the studio has been "extremely lucky" to be able to make games with both platforms. This, at the time, gave the developer a "lucrative and stable business," as well as a base to build an expansion into other platforms. Now, looking at 2026, it seems that potential is waning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"(...) ultimately you are one step removed from your audience, and you are dependent on their content strategy, so it is not a solid base to build a long term business around," the CEO says. "So ultimately we needed to wean ourselves off that dependency, by continuing to invest on our own IP, building porting and publishing skills in-house, and strengthening our direct relationship with our audience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-weeks-after-workers-vote-to-unionize" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft closes Halifax studio weeks after workers vote to unionize</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Monument Valley 3 leaving Netflix was a &quot;total surprise&quot; to ustwo">Monument Valley 3 leaving Netflix was a "total surprise" to ustwo</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, speaking to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/monument-valley-3-is-heading-to-netflix-games-to-avoid-app-store-compromise-">Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after the reveal of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lead producer John Lau said the decision to renew its partnership with Netflix was due to how much the App Store had changed in the past decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Lau, Netflix's potential was divided into two primary reasons: a massive existing subscriber base, as video games are part of the regular service, and a landscape that isn't focused on surfacing free-to-play projects and titles that prioritize "high user-acquisition," referring to the App Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It also allows it to stay Monument Valley rather than change its mechanics or do whatever else you need to do to survive in a different [ecosystem]," Lau said. "[The Netflix Games deal is about] trying to make the kind of game we wanted to make, without having to compromise in order for it to survive in the kind of App Store that exists in the modern day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, Netflix removed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from the service six months after launch. According to Sayans, this came "as a total surprise" to the studio, after working with Netflix for a few years developing the title and having a strong marketing campaign behind it.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shape-of-dreams-has-topped-1-million-sales" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shape of Dreams has topped 1 million sales</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A number of games were taken off the service at the same time, so I assume it is related to the evolution of their content strategy and priorities," the CEO says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, in relation to what Lau mentioned about the game's design, Sayans explains that there were indeed decisions that were "meant to suit a subscription service" in terms of engagement, retention features, and content update frequency.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once ustwo learned the game was coming off the service, it took it as an opportunity to redesign the game ending and post launch content "in a way that better suited a premium product."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sayans argues that in some categories, such as party games, premium mobile is a "healthy business," and wouldn't write off the model completely—especially with options like the "try before you buy" model. Yet, it's "not enough of a market" to justify significant development budget, so developers should see it as one of their platforms rather than the only one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, recent years has seen Netflix losing more video game talent than just ustwo.

            <p>The analyst who forecasted a Witcher 3 expansion release in 2026 has told me they're "100 percent certain [CD Projekt Red] will release significant new content this year".</p>
<p>I messaged Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski following a prediction made in a company report that said: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">We expect the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026</a>." I wanted to know how confident Chrzanowski was in that prediction and what it was based upon.</p>
<p>If you recall, I asked a similar question of Borys Nieśpielak, who is the other person credited with originating rumours of this unexpected Witcher 3 content release. Nieśpielak stood by the information and said it had been verified by several independent sources.</p>
<p>Chrzanowski - whose information I'm told comes from a mix of publicly available sources and conversations with CD Projekt Red - seems similarly confident. "I'm 100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year," Chrzanowski told me, "as the incentive program is still 700 million PLN short [GBP 144m]."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>This "incentive program" is at the core of Chrzanowski's reasoning. It's a part of the salary for key employees at CDPR, usually management, and it aims to incentivise them by granting additional shares should certain financial targets be met. Do well, gain wealth, basically.</p><p>In order to meet the requirements, CDPR has to earn PLN 2bn (£412m) cumulative net profit between 2023 and 2026, PLN 3bn (£617m) between 2024 and 2027, and PLN 4bn (£823m) between 2025 and 2028, Chrzanowski explained. And it's the first threshold bracket the pressure is particularly on. "Currently, PLN 700 million [£144m] is needed to meet the first threshold, with only five quarters remaining," Chrzanowski said. "This implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform."</p>
<p>But what has CDPR got that it can release? The company hasn't released a new game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> in late 2023, though it did bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">Cyberpunk 2077 to Switch alongside the console's release last year, which seemed to work very well</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 continues to sell surprisingly well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">passing 35 million sales-mark</a> last year and holding strong as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">a top-grossing game on Steam</a>, but in order to make up the incentive program shortfall it will need something more. The next announced game in the pipeline, however, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-whole-new-witcher-trilogy-of-games-released-within-six-years-of-each-other-is-that-even-possible-cd-projekt-red-thinks-so">The Witcher 4, which won't be released before 2027</a>, and probably not for a while after. In other words: after the first threshold bracket ends.</p>

<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CDPR referenced this incentive program in an earnings call at the end of last year</a>, when it said there was "a chance" it would release new content to help achieve the first stage of it. "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p>
<blockquote><em>"90 percent of the time it's pointed to a Witcher 3 expansion"</em></blockquote>
<p>This is what's behind Chrzanowski's prediction. "90 percent of the time it's pointed to a Witcher 3 expansion," Chrzanowski said. "This is a natural direction in terms of the required revenue scale. However, a Witcher-themed game like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-thaumaturge">The Thaumaturge</a> (Fool's Theory's latest production) would also be possible. Remember, Fool's Theory was built on a foundation of Witcher veterans."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">I reviewed The Thaumaturge in 2024</a> and was encouraged by it. Presentationally, it was a bit dated, or rather limited by what a small team could achieve, but excitingly, it felt different. It told a story set in Warsaw, Poland, at the turn of the 20th century - a setting I hadn't played in before - that revolved around a magic user known as a Thaumaturge: a person capable of reading people's thoughts and battling literal demons living there. It was strategic, thoughtful, authentic and unique.</p><p>Naturally, my interest was also heightened by The Thaumaturge being the debut game of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">a studio hired to remake The Witcher 1</a>. We know that remake has stalled a bit as Fool's Theory helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> team grapple with Unreal Engine 5, which The Witcher 1 remake will also use - CDPR's Red Engine has been left behind. But Fool's Theory is rumoured to be making this new Witcher 3 expansion as well.</p>
<p>"It's worth noting that CDPR is sparing with words," Chrzanowski added, "so such a strong indication of new content in the report and during the conference provides certainty, especially since declarations about meeting the incentive program goals have been communicated for a long time. The Thaumaturge premiered in March 2023, so The Witcher has been a priority since then. The team has grown from 60 to 100 people. However, some support the development of The Witcher 4 and are waiting for joint assets to be developed."</p>
<p>It's a convincing argument but there remain plenty of reasons to be sceptical. If something as considerable as a Witcher 3 expansion were in development - something which will be compared to existing Witcher 3 expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine - would CDPR risk not making it in-house? Those previous expansions have been generous, celebrated things. But to make it in-house would mean re-establishing a team that moved on nearly 10 years ago and working on old tech, and it has its more than full making The Witcher 4. Perhaps Fool's Theory has been entrusted with it.</p>
<p>There's also the question of what an expansion would be if it were in development. Geralt effectively retired at the end of Blood and Wine, and The Witcher 4 is led by Ciri. Presumably Ciri's story will be handled by The Witcher 4, so would that mean Geralt would come back? Wouldn't that be confusing in terms of stealing thunder away from Ciri? Or could it be a game about someone else entirely - the sorcerer Yennefer, perhaps? And how big would it be and how much would CDPR charge for it? Questions, questions. Let's hope we get some answers, and soon.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've been hearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">rumblings of a full-blown remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> for the longest time now. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">Skull &amp; Bones</a>' troubled development, those current-gen assets could boost the production of such a project, so the idea never sounded too far-fetched. We've yet to receive official news on it though. Now, a new <a href="https://raidshadowlegends.com/">Raid: Shadow Legends</a> event has got hungry Assassin's Creed fans all hot under the collar.

</p><p>The free-to-play "battle collection RPG" has been enjoying lots of success on mobile devices since it launched in 2018, but we don't blame you if you've never heard about it (other than in sponsored intros in YouTube video essays). That said, a quick glance at YouTube’s massive community around the Plarium Games-developed gacha will shock you: it's one of those games that trundles on quietly in the background, seemingly forever.</p>
<p>This week, it's been getting ready to welcome characters from the Assassin's Creed series via a new event which starts tomorrow, 8th January (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/accesstheanimus.com/post/3mbtha4s4u22z">Access the Animus on BlueSky</a>).</p>
<p>The key here is the short teaser - which hasn't hit YouTube yet as far as we can tell - that ends with pirate-turned-assassin Edward Kenway joining the fantasy battleground. We don't get to see the full design, which seems to resemble the original CGI model rather, than the in-game one we got in 2013.</p><p>Given the choice to end on him and <em>not</em> to reveal his full look, all the recent info we have about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced being real</a> and close by, and buzz suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">Ubisoft might have a surprise in store for us before Q1 2026 ends</a>, it’s easy to see why fans are shaking right now.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm of the opinion the January release schedule is looking a bit light on big new releases. With February and March looking way more packed, could Ubisoft be planning to shadow-drop the Black Flag remake on us out of nowhere? Considering <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-a-shadow-dropped-title-made-it-into-the-top-10-best-selling-games-of-2025.1387183/">last year's Oblivion remaster snuck into the list of best-selling video games in the US</a> with no lead-up marketing, such an approach to Black Flag Resynced and/or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would make sense. That's just me theorising, however, so don't cannonball us if the ship isn't ready to sail yet.</p>

            <p>Apparently, there are many studios out there that are interested in making a film or TV show based on Embark's shooter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>We live in an age where every game under the sun seems to be - at least in the eyes of producers - ripe for adaptation. These range from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">Amazon's Toejam and Earl movie</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivor's TV show</a> (both of which are still to materialise), to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">acclaimed dramatisations like The Last of Us and Fallout</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, it seems that Arc Raiders could be joining the ever growing list of games-to-screen releases, if it gets "done in the right way".</p>

<p>Embark founder Patrick Söderlund was recently a guest on GamesBeat's YouTube channel, when the subject of an Arc Raiders adaptation came up. "I can't tell you how many companies have reached out to us wanting to make a TV series [or] a movie out of this," the exec revealed.</p><p>When asked if he was tempted to go for it, Söderlund said it could be "fun" to see an adaptation of Arc Raiders. "It needs to be done in the right way," he added. "I hope that we will do that."</p>
<p>Closing down this train of thought, Söderlund said he believes the Arc Raiders "IP fits quite well with something like that". 

So, would you be keen to see an Arc Raiders film? I assume it would have to feature plenty of rubber ducks to be totally lore accurate. Also, would any adaptation be able to stand out from other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-film-adaptation-officially-in-the-works-from-paramount">already confirmed film projects like Helldivers and Call of Duty</a>?</p>
<p>You can check out the full conversation with Söderlund via the video below.</p>
