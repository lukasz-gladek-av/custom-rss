            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/27/russian-army-backed-military-propaganda-game-squad-22-zov-listed-on-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Squad 22: ZOV, a real-time tactics game developed by SPN Studio with support from the Russian Armed Forces, has been listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Steam</a> in the U.S. and elsewhere, as reported by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/"><em>Simulation Daily</em></a>. Given it was “developed with information support by The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,” according to the game’s <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">website</a>, this game should be classified as Russian military propaganda. Furthering this point, the <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has released two articles discussing this game.</p><p>Squad 22: ZOV is due out this month, but it’s currently listed on Steam as coming soon. The developer said in a recent <a href="https://squad22.online/squad-22-zov-is-now-on-steam/">news release</a> on its website that “it was a long and hard road” to get the game listed on Steam. Considering it is listed on Steam, it must have passed a moderation check of sorts – <em>Game Informer</em> reached out to Steam about this game, its listing, and its self-proclaimed connections to the official Russian military arm, and will update this story if it hears back.</p><p><em>Simulation Daily</em> writes that the X account for SPN Studio includes some “definitely distasteful messaging, like the mention that Ukraine refusing to surrender and give up territory to Russia is an opportunity to ‘have a lot of content to make more missions in our game.’”</p>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d1289594-f6de-4d50-95fb-d924b3886ead" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

	






</article>
<p>As for the game itself, SPN Studio writes on the Steam page that the “tactical action real-time game” was designed “with insights from Russian veterans and active soldiers” and “delivers an authentic and intense infantry warfare experience.” The Steam page also says, “Game is officially recommended by the Russian military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training.”</p><p>The Ukranian Center for Countering Disinformation <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/how-russia-militarizes-society-through-computer-games/">says</a> Squad 22: ZOV is “a key element in brainwashing the population, reflecting the Russian government’s version of events regarding the invasion of Ukraine and glorifying military service,” and that “by pushing war propaganda into all areas of life, Russian authorities aim to normalize the concept of war for their citizens and militarize society to minimize resistance to kremlin policies.” The center also says it has previously reported that Moscow is dedicating significant state resources to develop e-sports as a means of spreading propaganda, especially among youth.</p><p>Squad 22: ZOV also features the AI Generated Content Disclosure on its Steam page because “some 2D images in-game were pre-rendered using AI as a base for the work of our 2D artists and later drawn over in order to make them genuine art.”</p><p>Elsewhere on the Squad 22: ZOV, alongside statements that connect this game to The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, it also <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">lists</a> consultants as “Hero of the Russian Federation” and “experienced soldier serving and fighting in SMO region since 2014 and up to Autumn 2024.” In this instance, SMO stands for “Special Millitary Operation,” which is a designation used by the Russian military to describe its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this week, one of my industry peers James Bentley (they're over at that other site about PC games, GamerPCs I think it's called) put out a video essay titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/KtqrklovNHI?si=niPEfgfN3OxDxMmF">I Can Guarantee You This Game is Going to be Underrated</a>". Trusting in James as a critic of varied and interesting taste, I clicked through and found that yeah, they're right, it probably will be. However, I also get to write about indie PC games for a living, so I'd like to do my part in telling you about this strange, point-and-click/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/decade">Decade</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I don't think Decade is an easy, or perhaps comfortable game to describe, given its heavy themes. The game follows four children, specifically the four last children on the entire planet, the only survivors after metallic rain killing almost everyone else, the rest of them subsequently killing each other. Somehow these kids manage to get a time machine working, with three of them able to travel back 10 years to try and save the world.

<p>
The thing is, time travel or not, aging comes for us all, and these children do in fact grow older across those 10 years. While in the past, they can "investigate documents, technologies, and artefacts to understand history", all the while trying to make decisions that can lead you into several different futures. This, to put it plainly, is a concept that will likely continue to keep me up at night.
</p>
<p>
How much guilt should I feel for leading these children towards a future that might not even be liveable? Will I waste their years away in doing so? Do they get to have a future? These are questions I'm yet to answer myself through playing the game, but I'd like to, and it would be nice if you were interested in trying to do the same.
</p>
<p>
Developer Last Piscean worked on this solo after losing their job, and they still haven't managed to find one, and with the game releasing today (with a discount that makes it the price of two cups of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3272360/Decade/">Steam</a>), there's no better time to check it out than now.

The outlet also confirmed that DC and Marvel plan on doing another one-shot crossover in 2026. </p><p>“A lot of things have to align,” Dan Buckley, the president of Marvel Entertainment, told EW. “Mostly, we plan our editorial schedule pretty far out. DC does their schedule pretty far out. You want to have the right talent involved because with this type of thing, you want to elevate it as much as you can to get people excited.”</p><p>“It happens kind of once every generation of readers. I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions as to why. The timing has to be right in that you don’t want to do these too often. You want them to feel special. It is sort of finding that right moment for both companies to come together because it is complex. There’s a lot more coordination, collaboration, approvals that have to be done. And, obviously, from the business side, you’re sharing revenue, but it’s going to be a big deal. So you want the story, creatively, to warrant the hype of it all.”</p><figure id="" data-id="613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-recommend-id="image://613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC / Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-recommend-id="image://613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wells told the outlet that after writing 60 issues of <em>Spider-Man </em>he wanted a break, but Marvel offered him this chance to work on a Batman crossover and he decided that he “no longer needed a break” and hopped on board the project. </p><p> “In Batman, we’ve found someone who has even less time for Deadpool’s antics than Wolverine, but a city-wide threat from the Joker makes strange bedfellows (literally, if Deadpool had his way),” said Wells. “It’s been a blast letting Deadpool loose in Gotham City and watching what happens.” </p><p>Buckey added that the main reason DC and Marvel chose Batman and Deadpool for a crossover was that it was “a fun combo.”</p><p>“It was nothing more complicated than that,” said Buckley. “Like, Deadpool hanging out with Batman. There’s a lot of levity to be had in there, a lot of fun. And it would also be a little bit uber violent at the same time.... Our big thing is we want to do something that is a lot of fun, showcase comics, generate excitement, and bring new readers or lapsed readers back into the industry.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">With marquee franchises ranging from grand adventures like The Legend of Zelda to niche series like Metroid, few video game publishers have a stable of properties as extensive and varied as Nintendo. But though many of these franchises are regularly supported with new installments, many more have been left languishing in dormancy--and among them, few are as frequently clamored for as F-Zero. Despite the ongoing wait for a new title, however, the futuristic racing series has actually been experiencing something of a quiet resurgence over the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">This revival began in earnest in 2023 with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/f-zero-99-announced-available-today/1100-6517727/">surprise release</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-99/" data-ref-id="5000-603158">F-Zero 99</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-battle-royale-games/2900-6531/">battle royale</a>-style twist on the original F-Zero offered as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service. Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tetris-99/" data-ref-id="5000-493304">Tetris 99</a> (and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-99-will-shut-down-this-october/1100-6514261/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-99-will-shut-down-this-october/1100-6514261/">short-lived Pac-Man 99</a>) before it, F-Zero 99 invigorates the series' classic formula by exploding the player count, with 99 competitors all vying for first place. But whereas Tetris 99 is a battle of attrition, a grueling contest to whittle down and outlast the competition, F-Zero 99 is still very much a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-racing-games/2900-5482/">racing game</a> at heart; unlike other battle royale-type games, your objective is not to eliminate other players (although it is greatly encouraged, as doing so replenishes your health meter), but to outmaneuver them over the course of four laps. The increased player count makes these high-speed contests even more nerve-wracking, and the difference between success and failure is often measured in milliseconds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502165" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502165"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The result is exhilarating. Though it may not be an entirely new entry, F-Zero 99 is a refreshing spin on the series, one that offers a tantalizing glimpse at a potential path forward for future installments. The expanded player count amplifies the high-stakes thrills of F-Zero's best moments--of negotiating winding, hazard-laden tracks and hairpin turns at lightning speed as other vehicles ricochet and explode all around you. More importantly, the game stands as proof that, contrary to what disgruntled fans may claim, Nintendo has neither forgotten about nor abandoned F-Zero.</p><p dir="ltr">Since 99's release, Nintendo has put out a steady cadence of F-Zero content on the Switch, keeping the franchise consistently in the public eye. 99 itself continues to hold regular in-game events and receive periodic updates, including one that recently added courses and other content from the long-lost <a href="https://fzero.fandom.com/wiki/BS_F-Zero_Grand_Prix" rel="nofollow ">BS F-Zero game</a> for Super Famicom's Satellaview attachment. The company also dug three classic F-Zero titles out from its vaults and brought them to Switch Online's Game Boy Advance library over the course of 2024. GBA launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-maximum-velocity/" data-ref-id="5000-3277">Maximum Velocity</a> hit the service in March, while anime tie-in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gp-legend/" data-ref-id="5000-19983">GP Legend</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-climax/" data-ref-id="5000-21316">F-Zero Climax</a>, both followed in October.</p><p dir="ltr">The last title in particular is one of the most noteworthy additions to the service. Not only was Climax the final F-Zero game released for Game Boy Advance, arriving near the end of the handheld's life in 2004, it effectively marked the end of the series. Released in quick succession after GP Legend (which itself launched only a few months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gx/" data-ref-id="5000-4377">F-Zero GX</a> on GameCube), Climax was the third F-Zero game in the span of two years, which significantly diminished its impact. This was borne out in the poor reception it received, reportedly selling a scant 5,000 copies in its first three days. As a result, it would be the last brand-new F-Zero game that Nintendo released before putting the series into hibernation--and would remain as such for nearly 20 years, until the aforementioned F-Zero 99 arrived.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxqYOmjPWF0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VxqYOmjPWF0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">More notably, Climax was originally never released outside of Japan. Faced with the series' dwindling sales, Nintendo elected not to bring the game to other markets, making its arrival on the Switch Online service the first official chance many F-Zero fans around the world have had to experience this lost entry. But though it may not have garnered much attention on its original release, F-Zero Climax arguably stands as the pinnacle of the series' 2D design, with refined racing mechanics, impressive visuals, and even a course customization tool (which is even more enjoyable to tinker with now, thanks to the ease with which custom tracks can be shared online). In a way, this long-overdue release ended up working to the game's benefit, as Climax arrives at a time when players are much more receptive to--and eager for--F-Zero content.</p><p dir="ltr">It's tempting to think these re-releases merely served as an easy way for Nintendo to buoy the original Switch as it has shifted its resources and attention to the upcoming Switch 2, but the F-Zero series will also play a pivotal role in the new console's launch. From the moment the system hits the market, Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers will have access to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">library of classic GameCube games</a> on it--and tellingly, one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/">first three titles</a> playable on the service right at the outset will be F-Zero GX.</p><p dir="ltr">This is notable for a number of reasons, not least because it will mark the first time the game will be officially available in more than 20 years. F-Zero GX is widely regarded as the series' finest installment, and it makes a compelling showpiece for Nintendo's new system. Thanks to the increased resolution Switch 2 offers, the game's neon-tinged visuals remain sharp and vibrant even two decades on, and the addition of online play greatly enriches its appeal. Moreover, GX's arrival means the entire F-Zero franchise (with the exception of obscurities like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit) will be playable on Switch 2 right from day one, giving longtime fans and newcomers access to the whole series on a single platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502259" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502259"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Interestingly, that isn't the only way F-Zero is helping usher the new platform to market. F-Zero 99 also makes an appearance in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-ad-brings-back-paul-rudd-decades-after-his-snes-commercial/1100-6530992/">Switch 2 commercial starring Paul Rudd</a>. Although the ad primarily showcases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and Switch 2's GameChat feature, F-Zero 99 is prominently visible on the system's home menu near the beginning of the spot, which is likely the most mainstream exposure the game has ever received. Of course, it's easy to infer why 99 was included. The new ad deliberately harkens back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYhGL5y4DPQ">1991 SNES commercial</a> Rudd appeared in, which spotlighted the original F-Zero among several other SNES titles. 99's appearance brings the commercials full circle, but it's nonetheless a good sign to see it promoted (however briefly) as part of such a pivotal marketing campaign.</p><p>Between these re-releases and updates, F-Zero is in a more prominent position than it's been in many years, which bodes well for the series' future. Nintendo has been steadily laying the groundwork for a potential revival, using the free F-Zero 99 and a regular drip of legacy titles to gauge fan interest and introduce the franchise to a new generation of players. For all the criticism the company deserves over its conservative tendencies, Nintendo is often willing to give some of its lesser-known properties another chance, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-mans-final-chapters-are-a-masterclass-in-suspense/1100-6528480/">recent revival of Famicom Detective Club</a>. If a series that obscure can receive a new entry, there's hope yet for a new F-Zero.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio.1200003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A new report has lend further credence to last year's claims Apple is working on game-focused iOS app that'll integrate store, social features, achievements and more - with the company now said to be "seeking to sell gamers and developers on the idea that it’s a leader in the market."
</p>
<p>
Word that Apple was looking to expand its gaming strategy with a dedicated iOS app first surfaced last year, when news site 9to5 Mac reported efforts were underway at the company to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">combine the functionality of iOS' App Store and its long-defunct Game Center service</a> - which previously offered a centralised place to view likes of challenges, leaderboards, and achievements before the app was removed from iOS in 2016.
</p>
<p>
And now, eight months later, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival">corroborated 9to5's story with a similar report</a>, saying Apple is looking to preinstall the new gaming app on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV set-top boxes later this year. There's also talk of a Mac version, capable of displaying games downloaded outside of the App Store. As in 9to5's earlier report, Bloomberg - citing "people with knowledge of the matter" - says the app will serve as a launcher for games and centralise in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications, and other activities.

<p>
It'll reportedly also feature internally produced editorial content highlighting new games available within the app, which will include those from the App Store's game section and the company's Apple Arcade game subscription service. Bloomberg says the app is due to launch as part of Apple's next iOS version, iOS 19, and will be showcased during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on 9th June ahead of a September arrival.
</p>
<p>
Apple's push to create a prominent games destination for iOS users does, of course, follow the EU's mandate last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">Apple must allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces</a> on its devices to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Since then, a number of third-party marketplaces have taken advantage of the EU's new rules, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-game-store-and-fortnite-now-available-in-eu-on-ipad">most notably the Epic Games Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
A new game-focused iOS app from Apple would mark another small step in the company's slowly evolving gaming strategy, which has so far included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">launch of its Apple Arcade games subscription service in 2019</a>, new tools to help developer easily port their Mac games to iOS, and even a push to woo major publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft onto its platform in recent years - although efforts to sell full-price AAA games such as Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> to iOS users have reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">proved disappointing</a>.
</p>
<p>
Reports of Apple's new app come as the company announces its first video game studio acquisition. It now owns RAC7, the two-person studio responsible for Apple Arcade hit Sneaky Sasquatch - although an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/">told Digital Trends</a> the move was a "unique circumstance", as it saw an opportunity to help the team grow its game further.

Not only is it free to download, but it lets you explore one of the Tokyo area’s lesser-known iconic locations from the comfort of your home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, known as G-Cans for short, is a real-life disaster prevention facility. It is best-known for its “pressure adjustment water tank” — a huge cavernous space with 59 massive pillars. A truly epic looking, boss battle-worthy location, it is G-Can’s most iconic sight, and even has the nickname “underground temple” (chika shinden) in Japan. With bags of atmosphere, it also gets used as a location for music videos, Japanese TV dramas (like Kamen Rider) and movies.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/gettyimages-156814649-1748370157380.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The real-life G-Cans.

The ministry have released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKReBv1IRB0&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video on their official YouTube</a> which briefly summarizes the purpose of G-Cans and shows what it looks like in the blocky world of Minecraft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft’s free G-Cans map doesn’t just include the facility though — there is also an overground area featuring rivers, homes, and neighborhoods, giving the player a sense of how G-Cans protects people and places in real life. You can also go into the control room and try draining flood water into the shafts to see how it works for yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/000912066-1748370060929.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Minecraft G-Cans. Image credit: the Edogawa River Office.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MLIT’s recreation of G-Cans in Minecraft is designed to educate people about the facility and how it prevents disasters. Exploring it, even in Minecraft, also gives the player a sense of how absolutely huge G-Cans is. In real life, G-Cans' concrete tunnels run for over 6km under Saitama Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. Its five shafts capture water from flood-prone rivers during Japan’s rainy season (June) and typhoon season (usually around September), before gradually releasing it into the much bigger Edogawa River and Tokyo Bay. Completed in 2006 after over a decade of construction, G-Cans has played a huge role in combating flooding in the area ever since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MLIT’s G-Can’s Minecraft map can be downloaded for free from the official website of the <a href="https://www.ktr.mlit.go.jp/edogawa/edogawa01318.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Edogawa River Office</u></a>, which manages the facility.

            <p>
I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a>, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">forum post</a>, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/colossalorder">Colossal Order</a> shared an update explaining why the DLC has caught another delay. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we’ve received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
This, they say, left them with "a difficult choice: delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short." Colossal also said they think Bridges and Ports is enjoyable as is, but to "bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time." Now, it's expected to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, a free update is coming on June 11th that was meant to coincide with the expansion that includes a couple of new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays. It's something! To be fair to Colossal, delaying it probably is the better decision, I could quite easily see another botched DLC sinking that city builder shaped ship. 
</p>
<p>
I think there was some famous guy who had a plumber for a son that once said something like "a delayed Bridges and Ports expansion is eventually good, but a rushed Bridges and Ports expansion is forever bad." Might be paraphrasing.

At the time, it wasn’t clear what Nintendo meant when it listed some games as having start-up issues and other titles as having in-game compatibility problems. It seemed like Nintendo was saying that a small portion of the console’s massive library wouldn’t work very well, or at all, on the new machine. Now, we have some more clarity, and some good news for people wanting to play<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a></span> on their Switch 2 next month. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 27, Nintendo posted new Switch 2 backward compatibility lists</a></span> alongside some more in-depth information about what will and won’t work on the new console. The good news: Only one first-party Nintendo game, <em>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, </em>is completely unplayable on Switch 2. The console maker says this comes down to the fact that Switch 2 is too big and can’t be “inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles.”</p><p>All other first-party Switch games, including the other Labo titles, will work on Switch 2. However, some titles, like <em>1-2 Switch</em> and <em>Ring Fit Adventure,</em> will only work on Switch 2 if you connect an OG Switch Joy-Con to the new console.  It should also be noted that<em> Fitness Boxing,</em> also published by Nintendo, will need an update to work on Switch 2.</p><p>As for third-party titles, Nintendo has tested more titles and worked with publishers to create new lists. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">118 games are still listed as having</a></span> “start-up issues” on Switch 2. Meanwhile, 50 games  “start up on Nintendo Switch 2 but include some in-game compatibility issues,” and 54 games have in-game problems, but a patch is planned to fix these issues at launch or soon after. In April, the list of games with “start-up issues” was 130. Looking at the lists, over 20 of these games are now set to be updated and should work better on Switch 2, including <em>Doom Eternal </em>and <em>Pizza Tower. </em></p><p>Interestingly, some software like Hulu and Crunchyroll won’t be compatible on Switch 2 at all. It remains to be seen if that’s because there are new versions of those apps coming to Switch 2 in the future or because the companies behind those streaming apps just don’t see a point in supporting the new hardware. </p><p>Regardless, it’s great to see nearly the entire Switch library will be playable on Switch 2, even if I’ll have to dig out an old Joy-Con to play games like <em>Nintendo Switch Sports. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A month after EA announced it was ending its partnership with the World Rally Championship, and "pausing development" on all future rally games, publisher Nacon has revealed it'll be the new home of official WRC titles starting 2027, in an agreement initially spanning six years.
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/codemasters-has-secured-the-official-wrc-licence">inherited the World Rally Championship license</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters</a> in 2021, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. Last month, however, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">revealed it had "reached the end of the road working on WRC"</a>, leaving the future of rally gaming somewhat uncertain given it also confirmed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">laying off staff</a> and "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
But less than a month later, a fresh World Rally Championship deal has been struck with a new company, Nacon - the publisher behind the likes of RoboCop: Rogue City and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">disappointing Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>. It's perhaps not a huge surprise, given Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive) previously held the WRC license between 2013 and 2022, and released nine titles in that time, culminating in WRC Generations.

<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">today's announcement</a>, Nacon's new agreement "covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting [the company] exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032."
</p>
<p>
Nacon adds it's now set to begin development of an "all-new WRC game series, aiming to deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the reality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players". These titles will mark a "complete reboot of the franchise", and will include the likes of official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors.
</p>
<p>
"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks said in a statement accompanying today's new. "[Its] vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today."
</p>
<p>
The most recent game to release under the WRC license was the Codemasters-developed EA Sports WRC, which launched in 2023. Eurogamer called it a "joyous and rugged display of rally racing, with exquisite handling, lightly flecked by technical issues", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-wrc-review-a-bracing-and-richly-textured-celebration-of-rally">our four star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-brevity-should-be-more-of-a-virtue-in-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> another important sales milestone today, having surpassed 3.3 million units sold 33 days after launch. The turn-based JRPG created by Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler Interactive is one of the biggest surprise hits of 2025 so far. It has received unanimous acclaim from critics (getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.5 score</a> from us) and fans, too.</p>
<p>Today, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Kepler Interactive portfolio director Matthew Handrahan and Sandfall Interactive COO and producer François Meurisse. Among various things, the two credited the game with not dragging on for too long and challenged the view that longer games are better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Matthew</strong> <strong>Handrahan:</strong> One of the things that's great about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is it really respects the player's time. It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay. It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger.</em></p>
<p><em>Brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming. Something can be better by being shorter – something that's being discussed in film at the moment. Every film seems to be two and a half hours long, and I think most people are like, 'Can they all be a bit shorter, please? Because we have other things to do with our lives'.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>François</strong> <strong>Meurisse:</strong> From the beginning, we wanted to do an intense and short experience. The first length estimates of the game were closer to 20 hours for the main quest. I think we ended up closer to 30, even 40 hours if you take a bit of time. As a player, there are so many great games out there that I want to experience, and what's important to me is the level of excitement and fun I get from a game, rather than how long it is.</em></p>
<p><em>The value that players get from games does not align systematically with the length of the game. For example, one of my favourite games of all time is Inside, which lasts about two hours, but it's one of the most polished and intense experiences – and even life changing for some people.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released playtest material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024. The new Unearthed Arcana is notable since it contains another attempt at creating a new character class: the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Psion.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-psion" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast released the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Psion Unearthed Arcana. The post was accompanied with a video of Todd Kenrick interviewing the design team on the playtest material. Notably, this is the first video not featuring the (now departed) design leads of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeremy Crawford</a>.</p>

The Psion is effectively a psychic take on the Wizard. They both have no armor training and only a d6 hit die. The unique resource the Psion has the Psionic Energy Die, which can be rolled and added to certain ability checks and attack rolls.</p>

<p>Keeping in line with utility, the four <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Psion subclasses are geared towards different forms of play. The Metamorph allows you to psychically alter your body and the body of others. The Psi Warper lets you bend space between objects. The Psykinetic focuses on powerful bursts of energy and defensive shields. The Telepath enables you to delve into the minds of your enemies.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Unearthed Arcana's Wild Talent feats allow other character classes to dip into the new psionic power. They are similar to the Magic Initiate feat. Take this feat and your Fighter or Barbarian has limited access to some of the Psion's abilities like pyrokinesis or disguising your appearance with psychic power.</p>

<p>The Psion is the first attempt by Wizards of the Coast to create a new character class in eight years. Their last attempt was a similar psychic-themed class, the Mystic, in 2015. That class was ultimately abandoned, generally because it was considered too powerful due to versatility through psi points.</p>

<p>The new Psion class by comparison, is more closely inspired by other psychic-themed subclasses like the Psi Knight Fighter or the Soulknife Rogue. As for whether or not this class will be refined and released in a future book, that will depend on community feedback.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: Mists of Pandaria Classic will launch July 21, Blizzard has announced, and there will be a new way to get brought up to speed for those who haven't played some of the game's previous Classic expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has long sold WoW character boosts, and in WoW Classic, started selling them ahead of the arrival of The Burning Crusade Classic. The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content. This time, however, Blizzard is giving players a way to earn a boost for free, but it will require some legwork.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One free level 85 character boost will be given to players who defeat the Dreadlord Balnazzar, the first boss of the new Scarlet Enclave raid added in April to WoW Classic's more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers</a>, before June 30. Those who have already defeated Balnazzar prior to the announcement of the promotion will be retroactively awarded a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The boost can be used to instantly bring a character to level 85 on the game's Cataclysm servers, which will soon transform into Mists of Pandaria servers come the arrival of the expansion pre-patch on July 1. Players will need an active WoW subscription to take advantage of the boost, as it's required to play WoW Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice way for Blizzard to attempt to convert some Season of Discovery players to jump into Mists of Pandaria Classic, but given the amount of time and effort required to gear up to take on the Scarlet Enclave raid, the number of players who will be able to take advantage of the free boost seems like it will be fairly small. Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics. Mists of Pandaria Classic itself doesn't have a box price, but does require a subscription or active game time to play.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic: Mists of Pandaria comes roughly a year after Blizzard brought back the Chinese-themed expansion in the modern version of WoW for a limited time as part of its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">WoW Remix event</a>. While still featuring modern WoW's gameplay, the event saw players make new characters and speedrun through Mists of Pandaria content with faster leveling speeds, powerful gems that triggered additional effects in combat, and new limited-time rewards like mounts and armor sets.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">WoW's next remix event will be for the popular Legion expansion</a> later this year. Meanwhile, WoW's long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing system</a> is still on track to arrive as part of its Midnight expansion.

That's the question Greek highschooler Angelos Mako faced last year when he set out on a journey to rescue his favorite Flash game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/">Dungeon Rampage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, made by Rebel Entertainment. That journey only concluded after tracking down a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> programmer who'd long ago left the game industry...who had the only existing copy of its source code on a laptop handed down to his child.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mako's journey reflects the intense preservation effort in the world of Flash games. Ever since Adobe </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/38-000-flash-games-will-live-on-after-flash-support-dies-this-year-thanks-to-flashpoint">ended support for the animation and game-making technology</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2020, thousands of games were wiped from the internet. Despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-strong-museum-and-kongregate-partner-to-preserve-flash-games">preservation efforts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> vanished into the ether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over two million people used to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Facebook every month. But after a respectable five years of life, the online multiplayer dungeon crawler was shut down in 2017. While some fans attempted to revive it in 2021 via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DungeonRampageRemakeV1">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lack of access to the game's source code proved things difficult. Now Mako and Gamebreaking Studios are bringing it back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Gamebreaking CEO Taylor Hellam, Mako contacted art and creative directors who worked on the original release, who led him to Rebel Entertainment CEO Mike Goslin. Goslin helped the teen locate the last engineer on the project who was solo-maintaining the title for three years (Hellam witheld the engineer's name out of respect for his privacy).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/over-250-brazilian-devs-have-signed-a-letter-over-alleged-mistreatment-from-gamescom-latam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Brazilian devs publicly accuse Gamescom Latam of alleged mistreatment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was when the engineer discovered he still had a copy of the source code on a hand-me-down laptop he had given to his daughter. Mako then took the unusual step of securing the IP rights to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and contacted Gamebreaking Studios for support. Gamebreaking is now developing and publishing the revived game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reviving Flash games like ">Reviving Flash games like <span>Dungeon Rampage</span> is no simple task</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making it possible to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">back up and running has proved to be "quite an archeology project." The title was originally structured like an MMORPG, with Flash being used as a game client connecting to a server-side backend that was responsible for almost everything. When accessing the source code, the team realized the backend was written in an old C++ and PHP code that took a while to work around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve since migrated the backend to a fully containerized, cloud-based setup complete with CI/CD pipelines, so we’re able to continuously ship and test new versions at any time," Hellam told Game Developer. "The Flash portion of the game also required several updates to function properly. And getting it working with Steam required significant effort as well."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/with-an-ipo-on-the-way-let-s-dig-into-discord-s-revenue-strategy" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord's rumored IPO has us digging into its revenue strategy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hellam said that reviving Dungeon Rampage will require turning the free-to-play game into a premium title—one that will still receive free content updates. It's a signifier of how the free-to-play environment has changed since the heyday of Dungeon Rampage. Modern free-to-play games rely heavily on monetization models like "gacha and lootbox mechanics," as Hellam described them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio is buoying this monetization change with a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage">Kickstarter campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, meant to fund development</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As the game sells, we’ll be able to set funds aside that we’ll reinvest in development, adding new content and features over time," Hellam said.

More videos might follow, though Nintendo will surely be looking for any reason it can find to keep a lid on the new hardware until it’s officially out later next week. </p><p>A big software update for the Switch 2 was previously reported by<em> The Game Business</em>’ Chris Dring,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-day-one-patch-delay-nintendo-mario-kart-1851780793&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-day-one-patch-delay-nintendo-mario-kart-1851780793"> who listed it as one of the potential reasons</a></span> why media and content creators won’t be getting much early access to the hardware to test it for pre-release reviews.

That would be bad news for fans already frustrated that Nintendo is leaning into Game Key Cards and other initiatives this console generation that place less emphasis on physical media and products that work directly out of the box without the need to connect to the<em> Mario</em> maker’s servers. </p><p>But it’s also possible the nature of the required update might only lock the console from being used prior to a set date and time, but let it work normally after that period even without the day-one patch.

But I don’t. I always play Barbarian. Despite nerfs and buffs and stagnation, it’s a go-to class for many that, now in season eight, continues to excel. In this case, my preference doesn’t affect the choice here. Barbarian is still one of the best classes for <em>Diablo IV</em> in its eighth season, all thanks to a few buffs in the patch notes!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195150" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="526" data-playlist="195150,195326,194907" data-current="195150"><div><p>Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20607.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h82307"><a id="1"></a>The best class to play in <em>Diablo IV</em>, Season 8</h2><figure id="" data-id="5e0e1aa44363d5c17730c0c118179cba" data-recommend-id="image://5e0e1aa44363d5c17730c0c118179cba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Barbarian player character in Diablo IV." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Barbarian player character in Diablo IV." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e0e1aa44363d5c17730c0c118179cba" data-recommend-id="image://5e0e1aa44363d5c17730c0c118179cba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Barbarian player character in Diablo IV." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As one of the most entertaining classes to play, thanks to its hard-hitting abilities and satisfying number of weapons to wield (and the best cosmetics for your armor and weapons), the Barbarian remains one of the toughest classes.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> players are facing yet another delay for the beleaguered city builder's first major DLC expansion, with publisher Paradox Interactive having announced a new release window of "Q4" this year - closing in on two years after it was originally due to launch.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's troubles are well documented; the city builder sequel got off a disastrous start in 2023, forcing developer Colossal Order to reprioritise its development efforts amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">significant criticism of the game's performance</a>. Initially, the studio had planned to release its first DLC - the Beach Properties Asset Pack - shortly after launch, but it was delayed into the following year, while all other announced DLC (the Urban Promenades and Modern Architecture Creator Packs, and the Bridges &amp; Ports expansion) shifted from Q1 2024 to Q2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Beach Properties' eventual arrival did little to improve the community's goodwill; it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">slammed by players for its high price and lacklustre content</a>, leading Colossal Order to announced an 'indefinite' delay for all future paid DLC. Bridges &amp; Ports was moved into 2025 as a result, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">further delay was announced last September</a>, while Colossal Order focused its efforts on completing what it called the "crucial" assets editor.
</p>
<p>
In the months since, Colossal Order has continued to make improvements to the base game and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">launched some free "region" DLC</a>. But that "crucial" assets editor remains unreleased, and now the studio has opted to delay Bridges &amp; Ports yet again, moving it out of Q2 this year into Q4. "We've spent the last five months working hard on the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC, and towards our upcoming expected release," the studio <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">wrote in a message shared on the Paradox forum</a>. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we've received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
"That left us with a difficult choice," it continued, "delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short. We believe the current content is enjoyable, but we're not blind to what's missing, and to bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time... We're assessing feedback from our early access group and mapping out what we want to improve when the expansion launches - which we are now expecting in Q4 of this year. This is still a beautiful expansion, and we're excited about what it will add to your city. We just want to ensure it adds enough to meet your deservedly high expectations."
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2 players won't, however, be left waiting for new content until the end of this year. Colossal Order has elected to release the free update it was originally intending to ship alongside Bridges &amp; Ports on 11th June, offering "a bit of content that gives a slight sneak peek of what is to come in the expansion". It'll include two new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays, with <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">more details available in today's forum post</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Cities: Skylines 2's much-delayed console port, there's still no hint as to when that might arrive. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">originally due to launch alongside the PC version</a> back in October 2023, but has remained in limbo since then, with Colossal Order admitting it has struggled to overcome "hardware limitations" impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">warned</a>, "We will not have a release before summer", but there's been no update since then.

			<p>Developer Redemption Road Games has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1927416166772801659">announced</a> that Kingmakers, its third-person shooting strategy game that sends you back in time to the medieval era with an assault rifle, will arrive on PC in early access on October 8, 2025.</p>
<p>When Kingmakers was first revealed in <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">February 2024</a>, it had a small viral moment with its admittedly hilarious announcement trailer, where you watch a pickup truck smash through legions of armored knights that can't do anything but ragdoll against modern horsepower. Cut to watching a soldier firing shotgun shells into enemies chasing after him with swords, and Kingmakers immediately appeared to be a fun, chaotic time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That moment helped Kingmakers reach more than a <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">million wishlists on Steam</a>, with excitement continuing to build since. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they're able to play it themselves at launch this coming October.</p>
<p>It'll be launching as an early access game, of course, so we should expect that it won't be perfect. But the core concept of being able to run through armies of knights with a gun or a tank looks like it'll be a roaring good time, and hopefully, Kingmakers is able to make that key draw to the gameplay feel as good as it looks.</p>

Any that receive follow-ups are also worth considering.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Bow</li><li>Charge Blade</li><li>Dual Blades</li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-insect-glaive-kinsect-essence-1851774450&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-insect-glaive-kinsect-essence-1851774450">Insect Glaive</a></span></li><li>Lance</li><li>Light Bowgun</li><li>Long Sword</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield</li></ul><h2 id="h571424"><a id="4"></a>Corrupted Mantle</h2><figure id="" data-id="ccf0f90d2b614c9007d1363e46676c34" data-recommend-id="image://ccf0f90d2b614c9007d1363e46676c34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Corrupted Mantle-wearing hunter holds a Sword &amp; Shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Corrupted Mantle-wearing hunter holds a Sword &amp; Shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccf0f90d2b614c9007d1363e46676c34" data-recommend-id="image://ccf0f90d2b614c9007d1363e46676c34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Corrupted Mantle-wearing hunter holds a Sword &amp; Shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Corrupted Mantle is a complicated one. <strong>It provides attack and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744"><strong>Affinity</strong></a></span><strong> increases at the cost of constantly decreasing health</strong>. What its description fails to get across, though, is that landing enough hits will increase the buffs and remove the one drawback.

If your builds aren’t super aggressive, then it’s best to pair this with weapons that can make quick attacks.
