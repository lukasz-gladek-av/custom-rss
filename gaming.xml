<p>Xbox Game Pass is set to add a classic Call of Duty game to its library as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is heading to the subscription service. And that’s 2009’s Modern Warfare 2, not the game of the same name released in 2022.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/12/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-heading-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, Modern Warfare 2 will be coming to the service either in March or April this year. Insider Gaming sources can corroborate this report. </p>







<p>As of writing, it remains unclear if it’s the full game coming to the service or just the campaign. It’s also unknown if it’s the original version of the game or the remastered campaign. When it does release on the service, Modern Warfare 2 will become the first classic Call of Duty game to be available for Game Pass members. It will join recent titles Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3 (2023) as the only games in the series to be available.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/buzzfeed-ceo-wants-to-solve-the-internet%E2%80%99s-problems-by-making-his-own-version-of-those-problems.1106340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Tuesday, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced his company will be launching its own social media platform, news he buried at the end of a long, tone-deaf <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/the-anti-snarf-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manifesto</a> about how AI and big tech are ruining what it means to be online. This is, to Peretti’s credit, true, but if you’re worried his solution will be to stem the onslaught of journalistic job losses or fight back against the AI companies that want to fill the internet with even more crap, don’t be: he’s not doing any of that.</p><p>The manifesto is called “The Anti-SNARF Manifesto,” which is not a reference to <em>ThunderCats</em> but instead a clumsy acronym for “<strong>S</strong>takes/<strong>N</strong>ovelty/<strong>A</strong>nger/<strong>R</strong>etention/<strong>F</strong>ear,” which Peretti believes drives the current algorithmically-based news and social media ecosystems. He writes that </p><blockquote><p>The type of content that gets created and recommended is not the best content, but the content that elicits the most compulsive and predictable response from the human brain. When the platforms don’t care about content and ask the AI to maximize usage, the content evolves into what I call ‘SNARF.’ </p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The manifesto takes aim at TikTok and Meta for focusing on technology and algorithms instead of quality content, claiming that these algorithms then lead to situations in which (emphasis his)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Content creators <strong>exaggerate stakes</strong> to make their content urgent and existential. They <strong>manufacture novelty</strong> and spin their content as unprecedented and unique. They <strong>manipulate anger</strong> to drive engagement via outrage. They <strong>hack</strong> <strong>retention</strong> by withholding information and promising a payoff at the end of a video. And they <strong>provoke</strong> <strong>fear</strong> to make people focus with urgency on their content.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Peretti believes that “Through this lens, MAGA and ‘woke’ are the same thing! They both are versions of political ideas that spread through raw negative emotion, outrage, and novelty.” He writes that “the AI-powered platforms have... delivered a MAGA President that spews SNARF and a woke counter-culture that celebrates the assassination of a health insurance executive — big stakes, lots of novelty, and plenty of anger, retention, and fear!”&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think Peretti is wrong about content that <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obscures facts</a> or leans into <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-rant-facebook-dragon-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger</a> to drive clicks. In contrast, here’s a sample of current Buzzfeed headlines: “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikespohr/57-hilariously-unfortunate-people-youll-probably-feel-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">57 Hilariously Unfortunate People You'll Probably Feel A Little Bad Laughing At</a>,” “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexalisitza/political-tweets-of-the-week-2-10-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">21 Political Tweets From Last Week That Made Me Look Up At The Sky And Yell, ‘OMFG, YES’,"</a> and “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/abbyzinman/70s-male-heartthrobs-trivia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">These 25 Male Celebs Were Huge Heartthrobs In The '70s — But I'll Be Shocked If Literally Anyone Under 35 Can Name Them Now</a>," Buzzfeed claimed in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/why-buzzfeed-doesnt-do-clickbait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2014</a> that it “doesn’t do clickbait,” and by its own definition, I’d agree: You know exactly what you’re getting with these articles, and they even tell you how you’re going to feel about them. (You could call this, as Peretti chides SNARF for above, a “predictable response,” but anyway!) All of it is designed for social sharing and compulsive engagement based on a particular kind of <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/03/i-hate-myself-because-i-dont-work-for-buzzfeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brainrot</a> that Buzzfeed pioneered to great success, one of value-neutral <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/technology/how-buzzfeeds-tasty-conquered-online-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped-down utility</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Buzzfeed was at the forefront of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/11/28/this-is-your-brain-on-buzzfeed-the-science-of-viral-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral content</a>, arguably a precursor to the very “SNARF” Peretti rails against. The spread of that content took a hit from changing social media algorithms alongside every other outlet; in the years since, Buzzfeed has struggled to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/building-the-defining-media-company-for-the-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regain its footing</a>, so perhaps it’s no wonder Peretti spends so long being pissed off at social platforms. But Buzzfeed can’t compete not just because the internet doesn’t work like it did in the company’s heyday, but because the articles on Buzzfeed’s page aren’t <em>about</em> anything. Peretti uses the changing nature of virality to conflate Trump’s rhetoric with the widespread response to <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi Mangione</a>; he seems to believe these things go wide primarily because they upset people, and he doesn’t explore much difference in <em>why</em> people are upset. But in pointing out the real ways our emotions get manipulated on the internet, Peretti also seems to take aim at any kind of content that elicits <em>real</em> emotions. He’s not wrong that it’s less fun to disagree about health care and human rights than it is what color a dress is or which Golden Girl you are. But it takes a particular kind of Rich Guy Brain to spin that out into the idea that both sides are equally bad because, as he writes, “the result is an endless stream of addictive content that leaves everyone feeling depressed, scared, and dissatisfied.” People are, in fact, legitimately depressed, scared, and dissatisfied, and while I agree that plenty of news outlets and content creators lean into that to drive hollow engagement, Peretti’s view seems to fundamentally disbelieve that people earnestly want to care about real things.&nbsp;</p><p>Peretti putting the onus for some of this on AI is laughable when his own company has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/media/buzzfeed-news-shuts-down/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">axed its Pulitzer Prize-winning news desk</a> and conducted <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/buzzfeed-layoffs-new-restructuring-1235831847/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, leaning its full weight into <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/media/buzzfeed-ai-content-creation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/buzzfeed-ai-creators-news-shut-down-1235483607/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creators</a> instead. If it’s algorithms over people that’s driving all this, wouldn’t the smart alternative be thoughtful content created by real people; i.e., hiring journalists? If the AI-driven social media platforms are the problem, why would the solution be for Peretti to create his own social media platform “built specifically to spread joy and enable playful creative expression”? Peretti writes that “this social media platform will use AI to give users agency instead of stealing their agency,” whatever that means technologically, and whatever “agency” looks like when held up against a platform whose defining feature seems to be “good vibes only.” &nbsp;</p><p>In the course of the manifesto, Peretti does remember that he also owns the remains of some outlets. He lays out his plans for them:&nbsp; Buzzfeed proper “will bring more fun and playfulness back to the internet with low stakes content that is pure entertainment” and also, somehow, “counter the increase of gaslighting and misinformation by speaking to our diverse audience in ways that other institutions, media, and platforms clearly won’t.” The reporters left at <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-editor-in-chief-resigns-layoffs-danielle-belton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a> (who are now surrounded by the worst people you know in the news desks at the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-administration-throwing-more-pentagon-reporters-out_n_67a75e7fe4b077fd2382e9e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentagon</a>) will be “using ‘SNARF for good’” by writing, well, news. Food brand Tasty, once my favorite hate read, “will fight SNARF with utility and social connection… the Tasty app will give us our own platform to grow usage and loyalty by integrating capabilities such as AI recipe remixing, community tips and challenges, and creator-led content.”</p><p>Peretti can’t even make it through a paragraph about his own outlets before pivoting back into celebrating the very problems he rails against, an AI-driven tech platform that incentivizes creators. The main difference seems to be not just that it’s, you know, <em>nice</em> stuff, but that it’s <em>his</em> nice stuff. “I’m fed up with giving the platform companies advice about how to fix the internet, if we want this done right, we have to do it ourselves!” he writes. This is a man who claims to both “look forward to counter-programming with our human creativity fighting against the machine,” and a man who in December <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/buzzfeed-sells-hot-ones-studio-first-we-feast-rcna183956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Hot Ones</a>, a wildly popular interview food show that sounds exactly like what Peretti seems to think the internet needs, except that it is made by and for actual humans, and as such cannot be turned into a tech product.</p><p>Buzzfeed has looked everywhere for relevance except in hiring real human people to make good work for other humans to read. But “hire reporters” doesn’t boost a company’s stock valuation or give it a tech product to tote around for investment. Peretti is trying to solve the problems he identifies with the same problems, just with his own bright yellow “LOL” badge slapped over them. I look forward to whatever “listicles, but it’s a social media network” turns out to be.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-network-outage-psn-ps5-pc"><h3>The PlayStation Network Outage Is Modern Gaming In A Nutshell</h3></a><p>PSN went down for 24 hours, and Sony won't even give us an explanation</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallen-london-rpg-kickstarter-raises-six-times-its-funding-goal-day-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magpie-games-and-failbetter-games-announces-official-fallen-london-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fallen London RPG</a></em> has gone live. Magpie Games' official tabletop adaptation of Failbetter Games' alternate history gothic fantasy world has made an impressive start, raising more than six times its initial funding goal on day one.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> is set in the same world created by Failbetter Games. A setting made up of the browser-based Fallen London game and the various videogame spin-offs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunless-sea-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Seas</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mask-of-rose-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mask of the Rose</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-london-rpg-character-artwork.jpg?itok=RzsYmQ6e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-london-rpg-character-artwork.jpg?itok=clsCcmKA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in 1899, forty years after Victorian London fell into a vast cavern under the Earth known as the Neath. This has led to London becoming a twisted version of itself. Hell is close, immortality is cheap, and Empress Victoria still reigns. But the screaming has mostly stopped.</p>

<p>For certain enterprising people, it is a city full of opportunities. Players can explore these opportunities in the <em>Fallen London RPG</em>. Fame, power, defeating Death itself, opening a gate to the stars, or even restoring London to the surface are goals that can be pursued.</p>

<p>The RPG is made up of two books. The Core Book is 200+ pages and contains everything needed to play. The second book, <em>Guide to London</em>, is over 100 pages and contains new character options.</p>

The group, called a Concern, are devoted to a single Grand Ambition, a major goal that no single character can achieve on their own. But just because those ambitions are grand does not mean they are good. Members of the Concern don't even need to be friendly to one another; they just need to be united in their goal.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> will also feature an original TTRPG system. The&nbsp;Ædana System, built on Magpie Games' ten-year history of game development, is a flexible system built around a simple central dice mechanic. You roll a number of d6s equal to your skill level. More dice are added for situational or environmental bonuses. A 5 or a 6 is a Hit. The more Hits you roll, the better the result.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has the following pledge tiers:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Deliciously Digital for $29:</strong> PDFs of the Core Book and Guide to London</li>
	<li><strong>Watcher for $59:</strong> A physical copy of the Core Book and PDFs of the Core Book and <em>Guide to London</em></li>
	<li><strong>Agent for $99.</strong> Physical and PDF copies of both the Core Book and <em>Guide to London</em> and a Benthic Kriegsspiel digital item for Fallen London</li>
	<li><strong>Midnighter for $149:</strong> Everything in the Agent tier, a GM Screen, and a set of custom <em>Fallen London</em> dice</li>
	<li><strong>Master of the Bazaar for $299:</strong> Everything in the Midnighter tier, a set of Neathbow dice, a Deluxe Core Book, and a Sullier of Probabilities digital item for <em>Fallen London</em></li>
</ul><p>In addition, the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has unlocked additional extras thanks to hitting certain stretch goals. These include official VTT support for both Roll20 and Alchemy, new NPCs being added to the Core Book like Sinning Jenny and Virginia, and official <em>Fallen London</em> dice trays.</p>

<p>At time of writing the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has raised&nbsp;$313,727, more than six times its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign will conclude March 2025. The RPG is expected to ship in August 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-citadel-is-gory-obscene-and-almost-a-masterpiece.1106319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>God is in his heaven, all is right with the world. Credit: doekuramori</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>There are certain games or works of art that I cannot recommend without severe caveats. <em>Beyond Citadel </em>fits this category. It is an unapologetically horny game that contains brutal and graphic violence punctuated by moments of immense melancholy. It has a plot and world that is difficult to parse. It also happens to be, mechanically, one of the best made shooters I have played in years, and possibly the most successfully-realized followup to Bungie’s <em>Marathon </em>to date.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WARNING: This article contains graphic and suggestive images that may be upsetting for some people.</strong></p><p><em>Beyond Citadel </em>is a follow up to <em>The Citadel, </em>a retro shooter by solo Japanese developer doekuramori. In both, you play a character known as The Martyr. Humanity has suffered a near extinction-level collapse, and those who remain exist through the use of cybernetic enhancement. In the first game, <em>The Citadel</em>, the remnants of humanity were enslaved by an entity known as The Sleeping God. <em>The Citadel </em>follows The Martyr’s attempt to destroy the guardian angels and kill the aforementioned slumbering deity.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The gore in this game is very nasty. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p><em>Beyond Citadel </em>picks up after the first game and follows a similar structure: The Martyr has returned to the titular citadel, and now must defeat seven trumpeters, all the while learning about her past. The world is bleak, surreal, and desolate, and if you’ve ever seen <em>The End of Evangelion </em>or played <em>Nier: Automata</em>, you may find the trappings rhyme a little.</p><p>There are two things that you notice when you first start playing <em>Beyond Citadel</em>. The first is the sheer degree of grotesque violence in the game, although the 2D sprites mean that it is often done cartoonishly. Enemies not only explode into gibbering viscera, they also occasionally die slowly, sometimes panting for breath as they bleed out and occasionally pointing a gun at you as they die.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing you notice is that several of the characters are skimpily-rendered anime women. The Martyr’s outfit ranges from being a more revealing take on Leeloo’s bandage costume from <em>The Fifth Element</em> to an equally revealing riff on the costume from <em>Æon Flux</em>. When The Martyr dies, the player is often confronted with a first person view of her body being torn apart by bullets in graphic detail. In addition to this, the game features a gallery of borderline (although not fully nude) pornographic shots of The Martyr in compromising positions. Although I did not see any nudity in the game, not much is left to the imagination. Both the game’s gore and the skimpy gallery can be disabled in the menu, which is a nice option for people who just would like to play a good retro shooter.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Martyr's can sometimes find a backup body in case they die. Their outfit leaves little to the imagination. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>While <em>The Citadel </em>had a structure and quality akin to a very solid <em>DOOM </em>WAD, <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is light years better. The basic level structure of the game has increased in complexity and there is a verticality to the world that was simply not present in <em>The Citadel</em>. As your character levels up and gains new abilities like double jumps and air dashes, new pathways through the level become available to you. Instead of going down a tightly controlled corridor where enemies have the high ground, finding a secret way to the roof and dispatching opposing snipers from a higher vantage point might be the best option. <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is also masterful at slowly increasing the complexity, adding in vehicle segments where you drive tanks, mechs and aircraft that are surprisingly fun to play.</p><figure><figcaption>Boss encounters usually involve using a one-time weapon in an arena. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the increased level complexity, the weapon system in <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is pseudo-tactical in style. The game gives you three settings options for how technical you want your gunplay to be: ‘load only with no jam,’ ‘load and cock,’ and ‘unload, load and cock.’ I highly recommend at least experimenting with the latter two even on an easier difficulty setting, as they add a rhythm and tension to the game that really sets it apart from other retro shooters. Being able to lean around corners also adds to the tension of being pinned down by a hail of enemy bullets.</p><figure><figcaption>The train level is very Outlaws-inspired. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>Individual bullets have to be accounted for, and each gun develops a distinct feel and pattern that becomes organic. These weapons also develop in complexity with various mods, which allows every gun to be viable throughout the game. On top of this, each slot has three different weapons to choose from, allowing you to customize your loadout. During my playthrough I fell in love with the Cavalry Carbine with a scoped mod, a precise medium range gun which has to be chambered between rounds. The button to chamber and aim down sight were the same, so double right clicking became a natural part of the flow of gunplay. Guns in the game also have significant bullet drop, and accounting for that while taking out an enemy from across the map feels fantastic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Outlaws playthrough- Level 3 - The Train" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39eH0iq27II?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Outlaws rocks.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of all the guns, the carbine in particular feels like it was dropped straight out of 1997 LucasArts shooter <em>Outlaws</em>. This is not a coincidence, as doekuramori’s own Twitter bio reads “Developing Outlaws &amp; Marathon-like FPS / Gun simulator hybrid -Beyond Citadel-”. Reading the word “<em>Outlaws</em>” set my heart aflutter as I love that game dearly and, <a href="https://aftermath.site/27-years-later-lucasarts-afterlife-is-brilliant-brutal-and-few-know-how-to-beat-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like the game <em>Afterlife</em></a>, feel like it remains an underappreciated gem in the Lucasarts catalogue.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relics (PC-88) Playthrough" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVv2IW3WrYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As a developer, doekuramori is unambiguous in what projects influenced their games: <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, the work of H.R. Giger, Tohou Project, the ultraviolence of old school shooters, Tsutomo Nihei’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAME!</a>, <em>Metabarons </em>by Jodorowsky/Juan Giménez and the <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/relics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obscure X68000 game <em>Relics</em></a><em> </em>are all named references. This fascination in a biomechanical world is something I deeply appreciate and relate to as someone who grew up on the works of Shin’ya Tsukamoto like <em>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>The manga BLAME! is a key inspiration. Credit: Kodansha/Tsutomu Nihei</figcaption></figure><p>The contrast between biomechanical ultraviolence and skimpily-clad anime women leads some people to conclude that the Japanese subgenre of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ero_guro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ero guro</a> is also a distinct influence, an accusation that doekuramori refuted in an extensive Steam note for<em> </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1378290/view/2729698558760624504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Citadel</em></a> in 2020. “I am not guro artist,”doekuramori stated. “This is not a guro fetish game.” While I think it is worth fairly representing the intent of a creator, it is also fair criticism to say that when you are looking at The Martyr’s beheaded and almost nude body being ripped apart by bullets, that can sometimes feel like a distinction without a difference.</p><figure><figcaption>A diagram explaining how the world of Citadel fits together. A version of this appears in the game’s gallery only if you disable the erotic fan art in the settings. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>Part of what makes reviewing <em>Beyond Citadel </em>difficult is how obtuse the story can be. Some of this is a language barrier – the translation is not great, and it feels like much is being lost. Many of the explanations for how the world fits together are primarily in Japanese or on the developer’s Twitter account. Another difficulty is that there is an intentional ambiguity in how certain elements of the world fit together. Every zone ends with The Martyr defeating a large boss, setting off a bomb and presumably dying in the explosion only to be reborn later in another vessel. Between these zones, The Martyr visits a liminal space similar to the Black Lodge from <em>Twin Peaks</em> or the <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/End_of_Time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">End of Time</a> from <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, and meets their brother Elulu. These sudden moments of quiet and rest are often deployed in a shockingly endearing way. The Martyr is clearly several different clones, and so how real are any of these experiences, and how reliable is The Martyr’s perspective? Is the consciousness of The Martyr the same from body to body? It is clear that there is a greater plan underway that The Martyr is simply a pawn in (the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Millenarianism</a> is thrown around a bunch near the end), but piecing how these fit together can sometimes feel like trying to solve a conspiracy.</p><figure><figcaption>doekuramori gives a lot of updates and explanations not present in the game on Twitter. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who likes a lot of transgressive art, I don’t really like debating the morality of surreal violence in art, but it is fair to say this game will just put a lot of people off. It should also be said that <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is not a perfect game even if you accept it on its own terms – it overstayed its welcome for me a little in the last third, although that is exacerbated if you complete all the optional side stages. And I will say I straight up did not enjoy the core motivation of the main characters once they were revealed. At the same time, I must also admit that’s clearly the entire point of the narrative – this is a world fallen from grace, and you are meant to feel severe discomfort at what The Martyr and others have done, down to the gasping mindless automatons holding their guns in while raising a single, shaking pistol at you.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tallboy. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p><em>Beyond Citadel </em>is a story about sin and redemption, and it takes massive swings in its world building that could only come from a true Otaku. Even if the combination of erotic fan art and grotesque violence didn’t always congeals into something I like, it is uniquely itself. Neither the violence or sexuality are what makes <em>Beyond Citadel </em>&nbsp;a good shooter, but it is also true that only someone with those proclivities like doekuramori, a dev who straight up retweets fan hentai of his characters, could have made this game.&nbsp;</p><p>Dominic Tarason said in his review for PC Gamer that <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is a game he wants to recommend to “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/beyond-citadel-is-a-great-retro-fps-that-i-want-to-recommend-to-everybody-and-nobody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everybody and nobody</a>”, and while I understand that, I actually <em>do </em>know specifically who this game is for. This is a game strictly for the freaks, a term I would safely use to describe myself with endearment. I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone, but neither would I make blanket recommendations for Throbbing Gristle, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl0D6GbUdN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any film by Kōji Wakamatsu</a>, the French novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Necrophiliac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Necrophiliac</em></a> and the undeniably gorgeous yet sadistic manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_Tsubaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shojo Tsubaki</em></a>. It is too depraved for unqualified praise, too unique to ignore, and technically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years. <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is a bizarre masterpiece, one that elevates it above the corny category “boomer shooter,” and I can’t safely say you’d find the experience an enjoyable one.</p><figure><figcaption>I love the Easter eggs in this game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-adamas-cod-league-next-level/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League has been the pinnacle of COD esports for the last five years. It’s the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem, a multi-million-dollar league backed by the biggest names in modern gaming such as FaZe, OpTic, Cloud9, and 100 Thieves. Behind the scenes, one company has worked tirelessly to bring several teams to the next level in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Enter Adamas, a performance, leadership, and development coaching organisation that has supported more than half the teams in the Call of Duty League. This effective, invaluable group has been a secret power for many of today’s CDL squads, including those that have gone on to claim the most lucrative prizes in the competitive space.</p>



<p>I was recently fortunate enough to catch up with Adamas at the CDL Madrid Major, and I took the opportunity to question some of the COD League’s players about the impact this organisation has on their performance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-adamas">The Power of Adamas</h2>



<p>I’ve been connected with <a href="https://www.adamasesports.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adamas</a> for more than two years, taking a special interest in the organisation around the time that the New York Subliners went on a phenomenal run through the 2023 CDL season. The squad managed to secure two Major trophies and then won COD Champs, all while under the guidance and gravity of Adamas Esports.</p>



<p>In the last three years, Adamas has directly influenced the performances of the teams that have claimed seven out of 13 possible major tournaments, including the Call of Duty League Championship and the inaugural Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>At the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overactive-media-cdl-major-in-madrid-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDL Major in Madrid</a>, Atlanta FaZe stormed to victory just weeks after winning the first CDL Minor, all while being closely aligned with Adamas and singing the company’s praises. I connected with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta FaZe’s superstar players</a> at the Major in Spain, catching up on their impressions of Adamas.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>(They have) <strong>helped us tremendously</strong>. I feel like with everything — every aspect of our team, when it comes to trusting each other, being more of a team in all those ways, I feel like (they’ve) been just insane.</em></p>



<p><em>They’ve done so much for us already.</em></p>



<p>– Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tyler went on to note that Adamas has made the team’s mentality ‘<em>tenfold better</em>‘.</p>



<p>Even those who don’t ‘believe’ in the practices that Adamas preaches eventually see the benefit in what the company offers. I caught up with Cellium, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, to get his two cents on Adamas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Yeah, I was going to say I’ve never really been a believer in that whole ‘thing’. (They have) <strong>definitely proved me wrong with that</strong>, because (they’ve) helped me and the team a lot.</em></p>



<p>– McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I also had a chance to chat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the LA Thieves</a>, sitting down with Scrap and Ghosty, two of the team’s more prolific players. They shared similar sentiments about Adamas, which also acts as a performance and development resource for the 100 Thieves-backed CDL team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I feel like <strong>it helps a lot with the team cameraderie</strong>, just being comfortable with each other, fully trusting each other, calming yourself down if you need to. Mostly the team cameraderie aspect.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re a brand-new team, only been playing with each other two, three months total, and speedening up the process, (they’ve) helped quite a bit with that.</em></p>



<p>– Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We’re all just a fun team to be around, we be hanging out outside of the game as well, I think we’re super comfortable on stage together. I think (they’ve) <strong>made it even better for us</strong>.</em></p>



<p>– Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-from-the-source">From the Source</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Matt Fisher has worked with the biggest names in Call of Duty esports</figcaption></figure>







<p>I had an extended chat with Matt ‘Fish’ Fisher, the Director of Performance at Adamas Esports and one of the nicest and most confident people I’ve ever met. He started his CDL journey with the New York Subliners, aligning himself with the industry greats like James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks and working to instil an ‘identity of athlete’ where the concept had never before surfaced.</p>



<p>He gave me the secret recipe for the company’s work inside the Call of Duty League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>One of our core philosophies at Adamas is that we take a human-centered approach. Regardless of the game you play, the happier and healthier you are as a human being, the better you will perform both in game and in life. </em></p>



<p><em>We haven’t taught a single COD player or coach how to improve their strategies or technical skills, but we have helped them recognise how optimising other aspects of their lives will have a carry-over effect to in-game.</em></p>



<p><em>Much of our work is in helping to establish and maintain a team culture and environment that is conducive to both wellness and performance. Our goal is to set these organisations up with a foundation that will lead to consistent performance year after year, and allow their talent to perform to their full potential.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the results are certainly front and centre for all to see. Fish gave me critical insights into the end-to-end process, from the team-building exercises to pre-match traditions and preparations. He noted that while we were talking, the Atlanta FaZe team was ‘meditating’ backstage, suggesting that it’s a practice that might seem unorthodox or invalid to some players.</p>



<p>That was shortly before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/drazah-shots-fired-lat-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FaZe went on to win</a> the first CDL Major of the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Last season, the Adamas folks teamed up with the LA Guerrillas, a squad that almost went dark for a while as it tussled with internal issues and a lack of funding.</p>



<p>The roster was made up mostly of untested talent, but as Fish put it,<em> ‘We feel like they were able to prove that a ‘bare bones’ team with minimum investment in player salaries and staff, supported by Adamas’ expertise, could lead to results that many considered a huge ‘overachievement’.’</em></p>



<p>From the top to the bottom, Adamas supports the Call of Duty League. The organisation helps the players immeasurably, but there’s also plenty of time spent with organisation owners and general managers, with the company promoting a growth mindset that allows the key decision-makers to <strong>make the <em>right</em> decisions</strong>, which at the end of the day, benefits <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-iv-dreamhack-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty League’s 2025 season</a> continues to unravel. From this Friday, the qualifiers are back for Major II, and beyond that, there are another five months of competitive coverage lined up.</p>

PlayStation and Xbox both charge for online multiplayer, so why not Nintendo? Well, no native voice chat for one, but hey, Nintendo’s gonna Nintendo. To sweeten the pot, the company threw in access to a growing library of classic NES games. For anyone who hadn’t already purchased a NES Classic two years earlier, it was a nice trip down memory lane for just $20 a year. </p><p>But since then it’s grown, and so has the price. Switch Online added SNES games in 2019, followed by Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games in 2021, which it bundled together in a separate Expansion Pack that increased the total annual price to $50. Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games are the latest to join that tiered library, which now includes over 200 games total across three generations of consoles and handhelds. </p><p>It feels more than a little absurd that the only way to (legally) access these games in the year 2025 is to effectively rent them for an annual fee. What started off as a welcome novelty drafting off the broader incorruptible enthusiasm for the Switch in its early years has now become a bit of a ripoff. I’m long past the point of wanting a giant buffet of retro games to occasionally peruse at my leisure. I know what I want to play and what I’ll keep returning to. Why am I spending $50 to show<em> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> to my kid for the first time? It was not always thus.</p><p>Nintendo has often lagged behind its competitors when it comes to online features and digital marketplaces, but it was actually first in letting players pay to download and play old games on modern consoles. The Wii launched in 2006 with the Virtual Console, offering old NES games for sale digitally including <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Mario Bros.</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. I still remember, during my first semester home from college, popping in my debit card to buy <em>Military Madness</em> and experiencing its amazing sci-fi soundtrack and moon-based warfare for the first time in a decade. </p><figure id="" data-id="736aae99131396ed81520eb393844dbc" data-recommend-id="image://736aae99131396ed81520eb393844dbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2250" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Switch Online is displayed on a Switch.

It was a perfect model with one glaring flaw on Nintendo’s hardware: your purchase history didn’t carry over from console to console. The Virtual Console on Wii was different from the one on 3DS which was different from the one on Wii U. Players had to keep buying the same games over and over again which became something of a joke, a bit of shorthand for how out of touch Nintendo was.</p><p>This frustration potentially paved the way for some of the initial positivity surrounding the launch of Switch Online. Finally a single, permanent library. No more buying<em> Excitebike</em> for the fourth time. Instead, it turns out the Switch would have been the perfect time to <em>keep</em> doing the Virtual Console. Nintendo has already confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2. All those downloaded copies of <em>StarTropics</em>, <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, and <em>Wonder Boy in Monster Land</em> would have actually carried over this time. </p><p>Instead Nintendo is playing the role of the last online Blockbuster, badgering me for $4 every time I want to revisit the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games, but without the option to just buy it by never returning it because it got lost under my car seat. Game Pass may have shattered the value proposition of buying stuff on Xbox, but at least it still lets you. Nintendo was once at the forefront of digital game preservation on console. Now we’ve got Switch Online, which feels like a relic from a stingier, more stubborn era at the company. </p><p>If Nintendo doesn’t bring back the Virtual Console for the Switch 2, things might only get more frustrating this time around. We could be looking at an annual $100 WaveBird Pack that adds all-time great GameCube games that will otherwise never get remade or ported, like <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash </em>and <em>Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader</em>. And I will pay it because I am a fanboy ruled by nostalgia and a chump. It doesn’t have to be this way. </p><p>Other publishers, including Capcom and Konami, have shown it’s possible to sell great anthologies of old games on Switch. Some have even partnered with companies like Digital Eclipse to add all kinds of extra bells and whistles, like auto-play options and vast in-game archives of everything from scans of original booklets to developer notes and sketches. Others have released HD collections, like Square Enix’s<em> Mana</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>  remasters.</p><p>“The existence of [Switch Online] doesn’t preclude Nintendo from <em>selling</em> these games, either, no more so than the existence of Netflix negates the idea of Blu-ray,” former <em>Kotaku </em>editor Chris Kohler (who now works at Digital Eclipse) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773">wrote back in 2018</a></span>.

<p>The competitive Rainbow Six Siege community has come to the support of a Team Secret player after the CEO of his team released him and criticized him for showing emotion after a loss. Numerous players and personalities are now calling out the CEO for their behavior.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-secret-ceo-s-actions-uncover-the-need-to-talk-about-mental-health">Team Secret CEO’s Actions Uncover the Need to Talk About Mental Health</h2>



<p>After being released by Team Secret following a group stage elimination at The Six Invitational, Australian player Jake “Virtue” Grannan posted on X that the move caught him by surprise. “Didn’t see this coming at all, after all the energy and work that I’ve been putting in,” he <a href="https://x.com/Virtue_R6/status/1889005812346941812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “One bad tournament has now lead me to be LFT [looking for team].”</p>



<p>However, a day later, Virtue and almost the entire Siege community were stunned by <a href="https://x.com/zypher84/status/1889338159739347427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reply</a> to this post made by Secret CEO John Yao. Yao shared a screenshot of the team after they were eliminated, showing Virtue facing away from the group. The caption reads: “I am also very surprised.”</p>



<p>This reply, which appears to disparage Virtue, has drawn the ire of several members of the Siege community. Virtue confirmed that he was very emotional, that he was “almost crying,” and that he “couldn’t look at anyone” after a bad series. Some of the game’s biggest stars came to Virtue’s defense, including M80’s Leonardo “Kyno” Figueiredo and DarkZero’s Jason “Beaulo” Doty. The replies and quote reposts are littered with players, casters, coaches, and others criticizing Yao and defending Virtue.</p>



<p>While many are clearly upset about Yao’s comments, they have at least opened the door for a greater conversation about men’s mental health. It’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to cry in front of others.</p>



<p>Did the Team Secret CEO cross the line? Should mental health become a bigger talking point in esports? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2013, John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-resigns/1100-6405525/" data-ref-id="1100-6405525">stepped down as EA's CEO</a> following a tumultuous six-year run on top of the company. During Riccitiello's reign, Activision's Call of Duty franchise overtook Battlefield in terms of popularity, and it didn't help when Riccitiello <a href="https://stealthoptional.com/article/unitys-ceo-devs-pay-per-install-charge-fps-gamers-per-bullet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joked that Battlefield players should be charged to reload</a>. Now, ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has shared his belief that Riccitiello was the worst CEO in the video game industry.</p><p>During a joint appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit</a> with former EA Chief Creative Officer Bing Gordon, Kotick revealed that Activision was afraid that Gordon would assume control of EA and prove to be a good leader for the company.</p><p>"I'm not saying this because [Gordon is] sitting here," said Kotick. "Our fear was always that Bing was going to run [EA]. And we would have paid for Riccitiello to stay a CEO forever... like we thought he was the worst CEO in video games." Gordon also noted that Riccitiello may have hastened his departure from EA as well.</p><p>Regardless of his feelings about Riccitiello, Kotick said that there were multiple attempts in the past to bring EA and Activision together as a single company.</p><p>"[EA] tried to buy us a bunch of times. We had merger conversations," recalled Kotick. Later in the podcast, Kotick admitted that Activision thought that EA's "business [was] in a lot of ways was better than ours," before Gordon pointed out that Blizzard's business is even better than EA's.</p><p>During that same interview, Gordon recalled that EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/" data-ref-id="1100-6529398">passed on the chance to buy Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, and Blizzard</a> before Activision ultimately swept up all three. Kotick also called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">the Warcraft film one of the worst movies</a> he's ever seen and explained why it was a mistake for Blizzard to focus so much attention on that project.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-10-to-12-hours-long-story-unfolds-over-a-day/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Compulsion Games, the developer for South of Midnight, has revealed that the game's runtime will be around "10 to 12 hours" as the story unfolds over a single day. In total, the game has 14 chapters that players will get to go through, with "a kind of urgency to it" throughout as you begin to unveil Hazel's story. Jasmin Roy, Gameplay Director of South of Midnight,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/south-of-midnight-how-long-to-beat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spoke to GamesRadar+</a> about this title, explaining that the game is a bit bigger than they thought but is in the original ballpark of what they were aiming for at the beginning.</p>
<p><iframe title="Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLBOyKqw58A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout the journey in South of Midnight, you'll get to go through different environments and biomes, with each new environment having a very specific atmosphere and type of mood. All of this was explained in a 30-minute documentary from Compulsion Games that was released last year, where the developers spoke about the themes they chose to incorporate into the story as a "love letter to the South," making sure to balance all themes carefully throughout. You can find the documentary above, where more of the specific details of the environments are explained, as well as the efforts that went into it.</p>
<p>In the documentary, you are introduced to four of the biomes that you will get to explore. This includes the Swamps, the Delta, the Appalachians, and a biome that is inspired by New Orleans. Considering how short the game is, and with it taking place across a 24-hour time frame, this seems like a lot of new ground to cover in such a short time.</p>
<p>The game is described as "a linear game with some bits of exploration through the sections, and you go through various different types of locations in the deep South, all the span of one day. So you start your adventure in the morning, and it ends at midnight," by Art Director Whitney Clayton.</p>
<p>In this interview with GamesRadar+, it's also mentioned that the game took around five years to plan out and develop, despite the game being a shorter tale for those who play it. This is due to the reverse-engineered 3D-modelled world as well as the extensive research, planning, and prototypes that had to be done through the years. However, Roy states that "the bulk of the game has been made in the last three years."</p>
<p>The narrative of South of Midnight is front and center. "There's a kind of urgency to it that makes it feel like we want you to explore, but it needs to support the momentum of Hazel's journey."</p>
<p>This game was showcased during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, a new title that is being made by Compulsion Games, the minds behind We Happy Few and Contrast. This is their third game to be developed and is set for release on April 8 on PC and Xbox Series X|S. Those who have Game Pass will also have access to this title when it is released.</p>

<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 could be on its way to PlayStation 5 (PS5) sooner rather than later. According to a tease posted on social media by Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the Xbox console exclusive is likely one of the next first-party Xbox games to come to competing consoles.</p>



<p>In a reply to a user on Twitter who questioned “if” the game will come, Corden gave a more definitive tease of the possibility.</p>



<p>“Not if, “when!” and when is pretty soon from what I’ve been hearing,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1889342523807527095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>

<p>The plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring more Xbox games</a> to PlayStation—and even Nintendo Switch—is something that Microsoft has been actively discussing for some time now. As sales of Xbox hardware continue to drop, the company is looking at all avenues to increase its gaming revenue moving forward. The most recent Xbox exclusive to be announced for PS5 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which is set to launch this spring on the platform. Also coming in the spring is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The latest rumors claim that Bethesda’s newest game is looking at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April release</a>.</p>



<p>Sony announced on Tuesday its first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-state-of-play-for-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> for the year will take place on February 12. Whether or not an announcement for Hellblade 2 or other Xbox titles on PS5 will be part of the 40+ minute show remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>
Following its multiplayer launch at the end of last year, free-to-play tactical FPS Delta Force will get its delayed single-player campaign mode, Black Hawk Down, next Friday, 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Delta Force - a revival of defunct developer NovaLogic's long-running shooter series - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-reviving-delta-force-fps-franchise">announced by publisher Tencent</a> in 2023. At the time, there was much talk of its single-player story campaign - inspired by Ridley Scott's 2002 movie Black Hawk Down and the classic Delta Force campaign of the same name - but it didn't materialise when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-call-of-duty-challenger-delta-force-hawk-ops-launching-as-pc-open-beta-this-december">Delta Force's multiplayer component launched into PC open beta</a> in December.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has given Black Hawk Down a (slightly later than expected) 21st February release date. It'll be playable both solo and co-operatively, with players taking on the role of an elite Delta Force operative as they "relive one of the most iconic military operations, where a straightforward capture operation turns into an impossible extraction." There's not much else to report just yet, but Tencent says it'll be sharing more "in the following days".

<p>
Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delta-force-hawk-ops-has-a-real-shot-at-knocking-call-of-duty-and-battlefield-off-their-perch">broadly impressed by Delta Force</a> when he played it ahead of its open beta launch last year, saying it had a "real shot at knocking Call of Duty and Battlefield off their perch". Its reception hasn't been quite so warm on Steam, however, with ongoing player complaints of rampant cheating having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">contributed to its "mixed" rating</a>.
</p>
<p>
Delta Force is currently only available on PC but the game - and its Black Hawk Down campaign - are set to arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 at a later date.

                <p>According to Activision founder Bobby Kotick, Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger was at one point in time interested in buying Nintendo, or at least interested in exploring the idea of buying Nintendo.</p><p>Kotick said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MN7nJdijzjfcP232NsHZF?si=mHGPjwjXQMiFbuZZEWcgqA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grit podcast</a> that Munger was not a fan of video games, but saw an opportunity to potentially make a bid for Nintendo. Munger is said to have floated the idea of spending some of Berkshire's immense holdings on making moves in the video game space. One of Munger's ideas, apparently, was to buy Nintendo.</p><p>"He goes, 'You know, I was looking at a couple other companies in your sector. I think if we bought yours, we should buy that company Nintendo, too,'" Kotick recalled. "He said, 'Have you guys looked at it? I was like, 'Yeah.' It was trading [at the time] at like 13 billion, with 7 billion in cash. He goes, 'You know, I don't think anything is gonna go really bad before I'm dead, and then if it goes bad after I'm dead, they'll just chalk it up to the folly of an 82-year-old, so you don't have to be so concerned about disappointing me."</p><p>This came about at a time when the French conglomerate Vivendi was forced to sell its stake in Activision, and Berkshire Hathaway was in the mix to buy it. That didn't happen, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-completes-buyback-from-vivendi/1100-6415550/" data-ref-id="1100-6415550">Activision ultimately bought itself back from Vivendi</a>.</p><p>During one of his weekly Friday lunches with Munger, Kotick asked for advice on how to structure a buyback from Vivendi. It was at this time that Munger reportedly said he wanted to fund the buyback. When he got up to go to the bathroom, Activision's Brian Kelly said to Kotick that if Munger--an adept investor--wanted to buy the stake, then he and Kotick should want that as well. And that's eventually what happened.</p><p>"He didn't like the business [of video games]," Kotick said of Munger. "He thought it was a step removed from gambling. He's like, 'You know, you're preying off people's addictions.' And I was like, 'I'm not. I'm actually giving them joy and fun, and if you ever tried a video game, you'd see that.' He always had this... little bit of an aversion."</p><p>Of course, Berkshire did not buy Nintendo. As for Munger, he passed away in 2023 at the age of 99. Berkshire Hathaway currently has more than <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-does-berkshire-hathaway-own/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$325 billion in cash</a> and could theoretically try to buy pretty much any company on the open market, but it has not signaled any intent to buy a video game company.</p><h3><strong>Microsoft also tried to buy Nintendo</strong></h3><p>More than 20 years ago, Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo. Then-CEO Steve Ballmer sent staff to Japan to broach the idea, and the team apparently got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-tried-to-acquire-nintendo-square-and-midway-years-ago/1100-6485939/" data-ref-id="1100-6485939">laughed out of the room.</a></p><p>Berkshire did make a very big investment in the video game space in 2022, when it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/investing/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-activision-blizzard-microsoft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought almost 15 million shares of Activision Blizzard</a> just before Microsoft announced its intention to buy the company. Berkshire paid an average of about $66.50 per share, and that price surged tremendously after Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision Blizzard. The deal was ultimately approved at $95 per share, so Berkshire no doubt made a very big profit on the investment.</p><h3><strong>Game Pass issues</strong></h3><p>Also in the interview, Kotick discussed Microsoft's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, saying he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella "got the deal done in three days." Of course, it took more than a year for regulatory approval, but the framework was apparently decided in just 72 hours. The only disagreement Kotick and Nadella had around the deal focused on Microsoft's vision for Game Pass.</p><p>Kotick mentioned how World of Warcraft has been successful with its $15/month subscription cost, and that's just for one game. "Why would I put that into a Game Pass?" Kotick said. "I said to these guys, 'Why trade our flexible business models where you can do what's actually in the best interest of the customer.' I didn't believe in that. But the beauty if you're Microsoft... you can take that bet."</p><p>Kotick is not the only higher-up who has questioned the economic realities of Game Pass, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836">Devolver Digital have spoken critically of the service since day one.</a> Take-Two's Strauss Zelnick has also discussed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">launching new games in Game Pass makes no sense for the company</a>. There are examples, too, of Game Pass actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/descenders-publisher-saw-descenders-xbox-one-sales/1100-6469046/" data-ref-id="1100-6469046">helping to drive game sales outside the subscription</a>, and Doom creator John Romero just recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-doesnt-hurt-game-companies-says-doom-co-creator/1100-6529136/" data-ref-id="1100-6529136">Game Pass doesn't hurt companies</a>.</p><p>Microsoft itself previously acknowledged that Game Pass can, in some cases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">cannibalize game sales</a>--but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">not in every case</a>.</p>

                <p>One of the first and longest-running MMORPGs ever made, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tibia/" data-ref-id="5000-18504">Tibia</a>, will receive a new class for the first time ever in its almost 30-year history, developer CipSoft has announced. The Monk class will join Tibia's four original classes--Sorcerer, Paladin, Druid, and Knight--which launched alongside the top-down 2D MMO in 1997.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed in a <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=8214" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> and teaser video, the Monk will be a melee fighter that can also provide a support role by healing allies. CipSoft said the Monk can be "played in a very special way" but wanted to make sure it fit seamlessly into the world of Tibia and existed in harmony with the game's existing four classes. The team also knew it wanted to introduce a new melee class that could also heal, but didn't want it to encroach on secondary roles like debuffing filled by Paladin and Sorcerers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMzXYOz6o7I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DMzXYOz6o7I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"In fact, one of our main goals was to ensure that the new vocation holds a unique position without undermining the value of others or rendering them obsolete," CipSoft said. "We are very happy about the arrival of the Monk and hope you are just as eager to experience what it is like when they spring into action."</p><p dir="ltr">The Monk will feature a few unique mechanics, such as the Harmony, Virtue, and Serene systems. Using specific attacks will build up Harmony that can then be consumed to heavily boost the Monk's power, while Virtues are powerful buffs the Monk can choose between. Monks in a Serene state will be considerably more powerful, but can only be achieved while playing solo or when there are six or fewer monsters nearby. CipSoft said the Serene system is to ensure that Monks are strong in specific scenarios when Serene, but won't surpass the damage of other classes or the Knight's ability to tank when not in a Serene state.</p><p dir="ltr">CipSoft said it will be rolling out five blogs in the coming days and weeks to dive into the design and development of the Monk. As for when the Monk will be playable, CipSoft said it will officially arrive later this year, with the chance to test the new class starting on February 25.</p><p dir="ltr">Tibia is free-to-play, with the option to pay and upgrade to a premium subscription that grants various perks like an XP boost, access to more areas, the ability to purchase homes, and other benefits.</p>

midseason updates include more game modes, limited-time events, and quality-of-life updates across all modes.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of Season 2, Activision teased that a melee-focused set of new weapons would be revealed for the midseason update. There is also a St. Patrick's Day: Clover Craze holiday event, and more details should arrive closer to the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 is themed around ninjas, and multiple dataminers suggest that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-tmnt-crossover-could-be-coming/1100-6529089/">TMNT-themed crossover is planned</a> for the midseason update. This is rumored to have an event and limited-time game mode themed around the turtles. Rumored operator bundles for the skateboarding, pizza-eating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fit the theme of this midseason update, as we have a set of teased melee weapons and the return of Call of Duty's Grind skatepark map.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual katanas were teased in promos for the launch of Season 2, with the additional melee weapons rumored to be a pair of sais, nunchucks, a bo staff, and a skateboard.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty previously had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-tmnts-shredder-with-a-gun-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2/1100-6512543/">TMNT collab with the Shredder operator bundle</a> introduced in 2022's Modern Warfare 2, but the crossover felt odd without mention of the turtles themselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442456"></a><figcaption>Season 2's Grind map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6_multiplayer">Black Ops 6 multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 2 Reloaded includes two more multiplayer maps: Bullet and Grind. Bullet is a new map that takes place on a moving bullet train, and this will be available in 6v6 playlists as well as 2v2 Gunfight. Grind is the 6v6 skatepark map originally from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also adds a new perk. The Hunter's Instinct is an Enforcer perk in slot two, which, when equipped, will mark the nearest enemy whenever the player eliminates someone.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Zombies">Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Players shouldn't expect a new Zombies map. The Tomb arrived with the launch of Season 2, so the midseason update will likely be focused on quality-of-life updates for the map. However, there could be special limited-time modes themed around the upcoming holiday or the rumored TMNT event, similar to the Squid Game mode in Zombies for Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Directed Mode also arrives for The Tomb, which is the guided mode that helps players complete the main story quest. Completing the quest in Directed Mode won't allow players to earn all the unique rewards, but anyone looking to complete the story quest for the rewards can use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-the-tomb-story-easter-egg-guide/2900-6181/">full guide for The Tomb main Easter egg quest</a> here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't included many midseason announcements for battle royale. However, the update will add a new perk in slot one called Low Profile, which enables players to move more quickly while crouched and prone, as well as move slightly faster when downed.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Season 2 of Warzone is dedicated to game improvements and anti-cheat updates, and the developer previously confirmed some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-dev-confirms-plans-to-scale-back-warzone-content-as-it-looks-to-improve-game/1100-6528901/">new content planned for Season 2 was shifted</a> in order to focus on game updates.</p>
