            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-free-updates<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Little Bat Games has revealed that three major free&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>updates are on the way, bringing new scenarios for you to discover.</p>
<p>The first of those updates, "The Blood of Troy", is available today, and it begins a three-part story in which you'll be administering (vampire) therapy to your 3000-year-old mentor. As you can imagine, a vampire that old will have some baggage he's carrying around.</p>
<p>Two more updates will then arrive prior to the end of 2024. "Spanish Nights" will explore pre-Renaissance Spain, while "Fathoms Below" will focus on "the birth of psychoanalysis", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=RGoDveS- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=KOQQvX20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is getting some updates for you to, uh, sink your teeth into.</figcaption></figure><p>Creative director Cyrus Nemati says that&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>"has touched players in ways we could not have anticipated", and that the updates should serve as a "nice treat to invite players back into our world to learn more about our oldest vampire".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, well, the clue's in the name; you are Sam, a former gunslinger who decides to become a therapist for his fellow bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>Sam's clients include "self-hating vampires, agoraphobic social media addicts, supernatural narcissists, and victims of centuries-old capitalistic systems", so as you can probably imagine, this is a game with a lot to say about the real world, vampires or no.</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>looks like a visual novel, it is, in fact, a "fully-voiced interactive play", and you'll have plenty of options when it comes to interacting with your clients and deciding what to say to them.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>has a pretty star-studded cast as well as a fascinating premise. It boasts the voice talent of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2"><em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>star Matt Mercer and&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s Sarah Grayson</a>, among others.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>.

While unexplained, this was presumably an effort to plug the leaks where physical copies of a game are sent to stores days or weeks in advance of street date, so that shelves can be stocked for midnight, and orders sent out to customers can arrive at their homes day one. But obviously this also creates an opportunity for staff to get hold of a copy, create a ROM, and pirate the game. Last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-edition-switch-gamestop-leak-fired-1850329759&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-edition-switch-gamestop-leak-fired-1850329759">GameStop fired an employee for doing exactly that with <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-dungeons-still-world-1851636866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-dungeons-still-world-1851636866">New <em>Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom</em> Trailer Reveals It Has A Whole Second World</a></span></p><p>This is a problem that’s exacerbated by another aspect unique to the Switch: it’s a current-gen console that’s easily emulated on PC. Emulators are usually about two console generations behind, and there’s currently little sign of stable, working PS4 or Xbox One emus, and 360 emulation isn’t going <em>great</em>. But the Switch was relatively old tech even on its 2017 release, which meant emulators appeared almost straight away, and seven years later they’re now capable of running Switch games at far higher resolutions and framerates than the Nintendo console itself. This means leaked ROMs aren’t the purvey of piracy carts as was the case with the Nintendo DS, but instead are easily captured PC games, making it ludicrously simple to upload footage online.</p><p>Thus, Nintendo is now issuing a flurry of takedown notifications on videos that are appearing on YouTube, showing the first Zelda-led <em>Zelda </em>game being played ten days ahead of the game going on sale.</p><p>The severity of such a situation is often in the eye of the beholder. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-tears-kingdom-switch-yuzu-emulate-pirate-1851293463&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-tears-kingdom-switch-yuzu-emulate-pirate-1851293463">Nintendo claims that <em>TotK</em> was pirated one million times</a></span> in court cases related to the matter.

<p>The next-generation PlayStation 6 (PS6) is already well in development, and major decisions on the console have already been made.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>The report claims that one of the disputes between Intel and Sony involved how much profit Intel would make from each processor. On top of the price dispute, backwards compatibility is said to be a major sticking point with Sony. </p>



<p>“Moving from AMD, which made the PlayStation 5 chip, to Intel would have risked backwards compatibility, which was a subject of discussion between Intel and Sony engineers and executives,” the report states. “Ensuring backward compatibility with prior versions of the PlayStation would have been costly and taken engineering resources.”</p>



<p>Whether that means backwards compatibility with just PS5 and PS4 games or that means further back in the PlayStation catalog is currently unknown.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sony staying with AMD for the PS6 processor?

The modding tool was only unlocked a week ago on September 9 so this is still a very early version of what's possible, but it's a sign of bigger and better things to come when modders inevitably spend months and years creating custom content.</p><p>A YouTube video of the <a href="https://youtu.be/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">castle</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/wKBkko6KJhA?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avernus map</a> were shared too, showing Baldur's Gate 3 characters Wyll and Astarion walking around in them as normally as they would the official game. Screenshots in the Reddit posts show the maps too, and while both are still quite basic, katszenBurger has plans to expand their creations.</p><p>"I had a lava area planned too, and maybe I could make the lake explorable a bit," they said on the Avernus map. "Dialogue is a work in progress in the editor, as are some of the environmental elements." But characters can walk around, pick up items, fight enemies, and so on. katszenBurger also said map making is "very simple," meaning others will have easy access to create maps of their own.</p><p>While console players can enjoy the wealth of mods being made purely through the official Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit, maps like these will remain out of reach unless Larian decides to fully unlock it itself. CEO Swen Vincke said in March this won't be happening, but perhaps plans will change after players managed it themselves.</p><p>The toolkit arrived alongside Patch 7, which added lots of other content including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>.

What inspired this idea for a photography game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Notar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: When I first started </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I was working on a AAA project that was going through a variety of ups and downs. There were too many meetings, which prevented progress. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> became a creative outlet for me on the weekends. I started writing a game design document that had info about level designs, the creatures that inhabited them, the overall aesthetic, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game's focus on photography was the result of ideas I had about the setting. I wanted to explore dreams and the subconscious and thought that photography could work well with this. I was intrigued by the potential of a game that lets players explore their subconscious and then uses photography to bring those hidden elements into their conscious mind. It seemed novel, and not to mention, I was a huge </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan growing up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This lore foundation was inspiring, and even though it's buried really deep in the final game, you'll find it woven throughout various dialogues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the early game design document, the levels were much wilder. I had a jazz emporium level where all of the creatures played instruments, a junkyard level where all of humanity's lost ideas were thrown into, etc. The levels were wacky and Fictional, so I called their inhabitants Fictions. The scope for the levels was too high, but the Fictions and overall vision remained.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about the process of designing a Fiction? How did you pick concepts to make into creatures, and how did you take those concepts and give them physical animal shapes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Skylar Surra was helping out with concept art. I'd give both him and Daniel Kraft the Fiction design, their quests, what the Fictions were going to do, the landscape they would be in, etc. They would then handle the details.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Daniel Kraft took over the concept as well and started making pieces of the Fictions modular, copying elements between them. This sped up our process greatly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to the game's playful art style? Why choose this visual style for your unique creatures and world?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Limitations! Many of our art assets are from a variety of online asset stores. We didn't have a dedicated artist, so the levels fell on me to "art" up. I relied on lighting for cohesion, which I learned by watching a lot of Udemy tutorials.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other benefit of our visual style is performance. By keeping the poly count low, we could focus more on making the game fun and less on constantly optimizing it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Fictions do a variety of poses so long as the player solves puzzles in the environment. What thoughts went into creating the various actions and poses some of the creatures do?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We tried to bring their personalities out on the map with their poses, interactions, sounds, etc. The Fictions don't care about the puzzles themselves; they just care about the outcome. For example, Mudwog doesn't care that we moved the lanterns closer to him to attract the bugs. He just wants the bugs. If you give Mudwog bugs, then it's a great opportunity for more poses to take pictures of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interacting with Fictions on Dream's Doorstep is our biggest differentiator since it allows you to speak with them and understand their quirks and habits. For example, Mudwog has no ego, but Wullard does! If you throw a donut at Mudwog, he doesn't care, but throwing a donut at Wullard will make him mad enough to smash into a rock, open a new path, and get a new pose for you to take a picture of.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what thoughts went into the environmental puzzles players could solve? How did you shape puzzles so they fit into the natural environments of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Jay Watford and I figured out tools that would give us a variety of mechanics to play with. Jason Burton then helped to make these mechanics look and feel good from an art and VFX perspective. From there, I'd mark out puzzle areas on the levels and revisit them throughout development, adding more where applicable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the time, it would be looking at the environment feature and thinking, "Hmm... I bet we could add a magnet puzzle here" or something along those lines. I'd then work it into the level to fit it in the best I could. For example, adding more rocks around if it was a magnet, trying to find dark places for the lanterns, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Friendship is an important element alongside photography in this game. What appealed to you about letting players befriend the Fictions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's just more fun to talk with characters than insentient creatures. It gives us more to work with in terms of minigames, quests, and IP. If the Fictions were similar to wild animals and didn't appreciate the things you did for them, it wouldn't be as satisfying. Imagine if all of the Fiction dialogue was "roar" or "grrr." This might be funny for a second, but it gets old quickly. When you get to know the oddities of Fictions, their wants, their history, etc., helping them becomes a much greater reward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating the minigames you play to become friends with the Fictions? What do you feel the minigames, as well as friendships, added to this photo-taking experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was all Max Shawabkeh. When Max joined, it unlocked a whole world of possibility for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He's a truly exceptional engineer and can really do it all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Max suggested we could have minigames on Dream's Doorstep instead of simply talking to them, I lit up. It was a great way to add depth to the game, giving players many more ways to engage with Fictions and get to know them in a way that simple text never could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think that the minigames are one of the most quintessential pieces of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Without them, we wouldn't have Jo'keel's Comedy Club or Justaplant's Court Case. These quests, while optional, show Fictions in a special light and imprint lasting memories. It makes you want to go back into the level and get the best picture you can of that Fiction.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> grades players based on their picture. How did you choose the criteria by which to grade the picture? What sort of work went into programming the game to be able to score the players on how well they did?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our goals for this were:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Easy to understand and objective.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not trivial, so we could make some Fictions and poses more challenging to photograph than others.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not so specific that the players couldn't express their creativity.</span><br></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Max, the coding itself was straightforward. It was designing the criteria and tweaking the difficulty that took time. We referenced all other photography games out there but landed on our ranking system since it made the most sense for the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players can freely roam the game or explore it on-rails. What drew you to have these two systems? What challenges or benefits did you face in letting players be able to do both?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we were playtesting early on, we felt that the game needed more than just an on-rails experience. Exploring on foot gave it a totally different feel. Players could take their time, set up the perfect shot, interact with more of the level, etc. The gameplay possibilities opened up. What's also nice is that the on-rails gameplay tours you around the level and familiarizes you with it before you unlock free roam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, free roam did take a lot of work. I had to add many more meshes to prevent the player from escaping the level, make sure that the surfaces all felt good to traverse upon, add more exclusive things that you could only do while free-roaming, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also had different rules for on-rails vs free roam, such as what happens when you jump on a Fiction while in free roam, what happens when you pass through one while on rails, etc. The work was worth it, though.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players have some ability to get creative with edits and certain toys. How did you decide on the tools players would have to jazz up their photos? How did you implement abilities that would make the pictures more interesting or fun?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creativity is a pillar for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and we constantly tried to work it into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had a lot of Google sheets with our ideas for minigames, quest rewards, etc. Most of the time, we came up with the idea, wrote it on the spreadsheet, and then iterated on it from there. If it seemed like something that would allow expression and be fun to interact with, we then assigned it as a reward to one of the Fictions based on their personality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most gratifying elements is seeing how other players use these tools. We have a small Discord where people have posted their favorite photos, their Dream's Doorstep decorations, etc. Everyone adds a different twist to it, and many have been inspired by the game. We've had a person cry during the ending of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while streaming, a person who created an entire wiki for the game by himself, and even a person who is now incorporating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Fictions into his own indie game titled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Abomi Nation: Monster Rifts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, our goal was to empower players with creative tools that not only enhance their in-game experience but also inspire them to express themselves and connect with others in ways that extend far beyond the game itself.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-to-be-powered-by-amd-as-intel-lost-bid-to-design-the-console-in-2022.981921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like its two predecessors, the PlayStation 6 console will be powered by an AMD chip, but that apparently wasn't a guarantee until 2022, when Intel lost the bid to design Sony's new system.</p>
<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, Intel and AMD were the two final contenders in the bidding process for the contract. Reportedly, a dispute over how much profit would Intel make from each chip sold to Sony blocked Intel from settling on the price. AMD, on the other hand, got the contract through a competitive bidding process that eliminated other contenders until only Intel was left. Discussions between Intel and Sony went on for a few months in 2022 and involved meetings between the two companies' CEOs, engineers, and executives.</p>
<p>Intel provided a comment to Reuters regarding the failed PlayStation 6 bid, saying that they "<em>strongly disagree with this characterization but are not going to comment about any current or potential customer conversations</em>." AMD declined to comment.</p>
<p>While being unable to settle on a price played some role in the decision, compatibility concerns were also taken into consideration, as going from AMD to Intel for the PlayStation 6 would have put backward compatibility in jeopardy. This was a matter of discussion between engineers and executives from both companies.</p>
<p>As the PlayStation 6 is still years away from release, it is not surprising that we know very little about the system as of now. Earlier this year, we learned that Sony aims to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful next-generation system</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> will play a big role in delivering what manufacturers are teasing as the biggest generational leap ever.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splatoon-3-updates-coming-to-an-end-seasonal-events-to-continue.981915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that regular&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates are coming to a close, but if you're a regular player, don't worry; this isn't quite the end for the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1835506615971356881" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Nintendo says that while regular updates are ending, seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-splatoween">Splatoween</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-spring-fest">Spring Fest</a>, and Summer Nights will continue "with some returning themes", so you'll still have plenty to do in&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, regular balance updates adjusting weapons "will be released as needed", and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges will all "continue for the time being", Nintendo says. Of course, that wording also implies that these events could end at any time, so stay sharp.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-match.jpg?itok=08CI08x6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-match.jpg?itok=fGlCe38J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates are ending, but the game's not going anywhere.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, this also means the servers won't be shut down anytime soon, so you'll still be able to head into&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>and find a game; you just won't be getting any more major content drops.</p>
<p><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates ending at this point makes sense; Nintendo supported&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>for around two years, with the game's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-releases-splatoon-2s-final-significant-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">final major update landing in July 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not this signals that Nintendo is gearing up to make&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, of course.&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>was originally announced in early 2021 as part of a Nintendo Direct, which would mean it was revealed about a year and a half after&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>updates ended.</p>
<p>If this timeline is indicative of Nintendo's current plans, we can probably expect a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>announcement sometime in early 2026, and that means it'll probably be arriving on whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">the Switch's successor</a> turns out to be called.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-city.jpg?itok=wXE7W50V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-city.jpg?itok=t5O7o4-2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we be getting a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>announcement in 2026?</figcaption></figure><p>That's all speculation, though, and right now,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is still very much a going concern. Updates might have ended, but the servers aren't going anywhere, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>action, your best bet is still&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>You can pick the game up <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/splatoon-3-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Alruna And The Necro-Industrialists opens with paired quotes from T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.</p>
<p>It's "a compact and high-density <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alruna is a dryad in a dying world - a spirit of life in the land of the dead. The earth is sucked dry. There is only The Sprawl. Poor, bedraggled skele-men dot the Wasteland of the Necro-Industrialists and shuffle endlessly back and forth in a toiling mockery of life. But are they the real enemy? Or do the skeletons suffer just as much as the dryads under the domination of the Necro-Industrialists? </p>
<p>And salvation? Is it possible? Dead men yearn for Heaven. But the dead can only dig... </p></blockquote>
<p>I've just given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2655470/Alruna_and_the_NecroIndustrialists/">the Steam demo</a> a shot, and this is a very assured production. You get a chargeable jump, a dash move and a slide by default, plus a choice of weapons and items plucked from the crevices of a world that includes four temples (plus a possible fifth "secret" temple, which isn't that secret given that they've mentioned it on the Steam page).</p>
<p>The music is pretty stylish, and there are familiar puzzle setups such as flipping switches to make certain platforms dematerialise while others grow solid. Power-ups include exploding mushrooms, magic vines and electro-plants. It's packing in a fair bit, though the square aspect room-based format makes everything feel quite tidy.</p>
<p>Aside from platform-puzzle gambits, we can expect hidden minigames, "a star-crossed enemies-to-lovers romance with a rival adventurer" and several story endings. It's got a pretty unvarnished anti-capitalist thing going on, without (so far) being didactic. One friendly character you meet complains about "endless progress and infinite growth". There is definitely scope for more Wasteland quotation here but hopefully, they'll restrain themselves.</p>
<p>The full game is out on 26th September. Developers Neckbolt are also working on pocket-sized trick-or-treat platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165420/October_Panic/">October Panic</a>. Their past releases include <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/602430/Yono_and_the_Celestial_Elephants/">Yono And The Celestial Elephants</a>, which Alec (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-new-steam-games-oct">deemed</a> an "almost absurdly wholesome Zeldalike", corpse girl adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/351340/Belladonna/">Belladona</a>, which seems a little less wholesome, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407400/Molly_Medusa_Queen_of_Spit/">Molly Medusa: Queen Of Spit</a>, in which you can walk on walls and turn things to stone. A studio to keep an eye on, probably.</p>

Through the simple act of taking a photo, photography games and photo modes implore us to notice our surroundings, document our experience, and take a moment to commit to memory the images and emotions that we felt along the way. As Game Developer launches its Photography Week, come along with us as we take a quick look at the history of photography in video games and its popular uses within the genre and preview the new interviews, essays, and deep dives publishing in the days to come. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In video games there are two primary ways we experience photography. There are games in which photography is the primary gameplay element, used to structure a narrative or add puzzle-based progression. And there are games that have photo modes, giving players tools to make and edit the perfect photo within the world they’re immersed in. Over the years, as graphical fidelity has evolved, so too has the demand for in-game photography; it seems like almost every open-world game has a photo mode these days. But players embraced the mechanic long before graphics had the ability to make their photos actually look good, going back at least as far as the N64 era. Look no further than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/building-a-compelling-photography-mechanic-mexico-1921" target="_self">Photography as narrative design in <em>Mexico, 1921: A deep slumber</em></a></p><p>Pokémon Snap as it appears on the Wii virtual console.

The resulting photos weren’t particularly pretty or artistic (and famously failed to adhere to basic photographic principles), but the game was smart in that it addressed an early issue in photography games by controlling the player’s movements and line of sight, avoiding the staggering technical costs of facilitating spontaneous Pokémon interactions in an open world. It would be many years before the game would see its sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but in the meantime, it would inspire many games, establishing a format that would be seen in so many later titles both directly and indirectly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts of Maravilla Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (all of which we’ll discuss later this week) would make their own spin on photographing a collection of creatures, sometimes adding an element of puzzle-solving to encourage new poses or scenes to add experiential variety.

For example, in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the camera is used to emphasize the journalist Miles Upshur’s vulnerability as he documents the horrors inside a psychiatric asylum. In many minigames and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/q-a-designing-the-photogenic-vignettes-and-camera-play-in-snap-happy-adventure-i-toem-i-"> lighter contemporary titles like </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/q-a-designing-the-photogenic-vignettes-and-camera-play-in-snap-happy-adventure-i-toem-i-">TOEM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the camera is a puzzle-solving tool, used to find and photograph items at the behest of secondary characters or reveal obscured information. And building on the direct link between photography and gameplay are games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Camera Obscura</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a platformer where players solve puzzles by assembling environmental elements from still photographs, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Viewfinder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which similarly “reshapes reality” by manipulating photographed objects.</span></p><p>Image via Thunderful Publishing.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Point and shooting the virtual world">Point and shooting the virtual world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As far as photo modes go, these days, they’re so ubiquitous as to be an expected game feature; more recently, games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/black-salt-games-wants-to-buck-the-trend-with-dredge-photo-mode">Dredge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have added photo modes in post-release updates, and open-world titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> use them to add value to the expanse of their environments or to help players tell stories through their characters. And it’s not just in 3D games—take, for example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Highland Song</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, whose depiction of the Scottish highlands and its accompanying photo mode are entirely in 2D (stay tuned for a discussion on that tomorrow).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also fascinating to note the role that early PC games played in the rise of the photo mode’s popularity. Before photo modes became the standard in scenic open-world titles, fans of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were using console commands and mods (including lighting and weather effects, poses, and animations) in combination with screen capture devices and software to take photos outside the limitations of fixed visuals and in-game camera systems, leading to the more formal tools seen later in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Meanwhile, young players of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the early 2000s used photography (facilitated by an in-game camera tool) to document and tell stories about the lives of their Sims characters, relying on the interactions of the game’s complex trait systems to provide intrigue and spontaneity. This, in turn, paved the way for modern-day, user-made game entertainment, from game streamers to machinima. Player photography has had a major impact on how and why we use photo modes—or even have them at all (you can read more about this in part in our staff blog later this week).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Highlight and Contrast">Highlight and Contrast</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If this topic fascinates you, there’s still time to submit an article to our blog section about photography games and photo modes in video games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-image-quality-improvements-cpu-upgrade/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro CPU hasn't been upgraded over the base model, and there are a few reasons why, including the system's main focus.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently commented on the lack of a CPU upgrade for the upcoming console by Sony, saying that price, compatibility, and size are among the reasons. Size, in particular, has been a concern for the Japanese company, even for the base model, as the part of the FPU was cut to reduce size and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>The reception of the PlayStation 4 Pro may also have played some part in the decision not to upgrade the PlayStation 5 Pro CPU. The previous generation's refresh system had a considerable CPU upgrade over the base model, but the main talking point of the system was checkerboard rendering, which brought 4K resolution into the console gaming space for the first time. With the upcoming system, however, the focus is to improve the image quality of Performance mode in several games, and, as such, a CPU upgrade wouldn't have served much purpose other than increasing the price of the system a lot. A more powerful CPU could have allowed for framerates higher than 60 FPS, but it's clear that delivering a high refresh rate experience is not the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/">focus of the PlayStation 5 Pro.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Has The Same CPU... Is That A Problem?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdC4KPlqmqY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th for the price of $699.99, €799.99. Despite the high price, analysts expect it to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">as much as the PlayStation 4 Pro did.</a></p>

            <p>
Nintendo has now formally confirmed the end of its regular support for Splatoon 3, in a statement celebrating "two ink-credible years". 
</p>
<p>
Fans had suspected such a statement from Nintendo, now <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1835506615971356881">posted</a> to X, following the conclusion of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-reveals-climactic-grand-festival-event-new-amiibo">climactic Grand Festival event</a> held over the past weekend.
</p>
<p>
Released in September 2022, Splatoon 3 has enjoyed a similar two-year window of post-launch content updates seen by its predecessor, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-2-review">Splatoon 2</a>.

There's no word on what's next for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> franchise just yet but, of course, Nintendo is now quietly readying itself for the upcoming announcement and 2025 launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Splatoon 2 will see returning themes for Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights. Nintendo will also continue to provide Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges "for the time being". And some balance tweaks to weapons may still be released "as needed".
</p>
<p>
This summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-rescinds-splatoon-3-world-championship-winners-title-after-racist-messages-surface-online">Nintendo rescinded the title of this year's Splatoon 3 World Championship winning team</a> - a North American group named Jackpot - after racist messages by its members subsequently surfaced online. 
</p>
<p>
The Splatoon 3 World Championship was initially due to be held during January's Nintendo Live 2024, but was postponed over safety fears after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suspect-behind-nintendo-live-tokyo-cancellation-death-threats-arrested-in-japan">Nintendo received death threats</a> from a man claiming they would "kill the people at the venue". The individual, a 27-year-old from Hitachi, Japan, was later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">arrested for sending 39 threats</a> using the inquiry form on Nintendo's website.
</p>
<p>
"There are few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3's multiplayer or campaign, but it is the best Nintendo's spectacular series has been to date," Eurogamer's former editor and resident Splatoon fan Martin Robinson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Eurogamer's Splatoon 3 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/new-world-aeternum-open-beta-preview-ps5-xbox-series-x/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>October 1609, Port of Amsterdam. The suspiciously-hooded Father Russo and be-helmeted Captain Thorpe are setting off aboard a galleon in search of the island of legend. There’s immediately a sense of mystery and adventure, the era renowned for exploration and warfare. It’s an inviting setup, and one which immediately calls you to action.</p>
<p>You, of course, no longer being restricted to the youse of PC gaming. We’re just about three years on from the original launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world">New World</a>, with Amazon Games now bringing their colonialist fantasy to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> with New World: Aeternum. We’ve delved into the open beta this past weekend, ahead of the full release on 15th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Open Beta Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BqDhFIjNfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a member of this ship’s crew, you’re set to explore, discover and gain fame and fortune, but you hadn’t banked on having to breach the Stormwall surrounding Aeternum. This bank of cloud, thunder and lightning looks thoroughly impassable, but Father Russo seems to have, with a mysterious box pulsating with blue light. However, as they attempt to make their way through the storm, an entity takes control of Captain Thorpe, murdering Russo, before making their way through the rest of the crew. Those, at least, that haven’t already been corrupted by the miasma surrounding Aeternum.</p>
<p>You make your way across the burning ship, learning the combat controls as you go, but, with the ship sinking, you soon find yourself on Aeternum’s shore.</p>


<p>You first choose an Archetype for your character, from the regular Soldier, whose heavy armour, sword and shield make him a natural tank/damage hybrid, through the more atypical Damage classes of the Ranger and Musketeer, to the hybrid Mystic class, that combines support magic with damage. I opted for the Swordbearer, their comically big sword giving me Berserk and Monster Hunter vibes. These are the type of vibes I like.</p>
<p>Each class also has it’s own set of Trade Skills to further the tough decision-making process. The Swordbearer has boosts in Leatherworking – this let’s you refine collected hides and turn them into leather – while Cooking and Fishing are also similarly enhanced. There’s a whole host of Trade Skills, with Mining, Weaving and Weaponsmithing just a small selection of the skills on offer.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, New World: Aeternum offers player progression that centres on gaining experience and collecting improved equipment. The opening quests give your starting gear a much-needed upgrade, and from there it becomes about tailoring your build to suit your playstyle. Rarer equipment carries a range of further skills or boosts so you’ll find from the outset you’re digging into the stats and buffs for every single piece. The community has warned during the beta, that New World Aeternum is something of a grind fest, but that’s just part of the territory if you’re an MMORPG fan.</p>

<p>New World Aeternum can be seriously beautiful, and the art design especially captures the incredible otherworldliness of the island of Aeternum.&nbsp; Your character model is less impressive though; while it’s relatively detailed, the animation looks and feels more like you’d expect of a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 game. Still, this is an MMO after all, and it has rather a lot to juggle.</p>
<p>Playing on Xbox Series X, there’s three different visual settings, with Quality, Performance and 4K giving players the option to tailor their experience. During the beta, there’s been a lot of other players running around every area – I imagine this will lessen through the full release as people move on beyond the opening areas – and it’s one of the things that I’ve always found ruins the grounding of many an MMO.</p>
<p>Still, this obviously has an impact on performance, and the frame rate takes a big tank when you’re in these heavily populated areas, particularly Windsward, the first city. The thing is, New World Aeternum looks far less impressive in Performance mode, dropping the resolution down to such a level that those Xbox 360 comparisons become even more relevant. It’s a shame, because there’s so much to like about the art design, and hopefully the full release will have seen more optimisations, allowing you to see all the wonderful details the team have included, while letting players shoot for 60fps.</p>

<p>Our first experience of New World: Aeternum has been a positive one, offering a beguiling world, intriguing storytelling and enjoyable action combat. Here’s hoping that it can sustain that excitement through many, many hours of adventuring. We’ll be first in line to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-official-name-production/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has entered<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-entered-production/"> full production</a>, and the unofficial name that has been used so far for the system may be the official one, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fi0y6i/switch_successor_is_named_switch_2/?share_id=ne9NoeYhtppb_NwSUTDJJ&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, a Famiboard user called <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3376#post-1261568">fwd-bwd</a> shared new information discovered on a Chinese forum from a supposed line worker regarding the console. This Chinese user revealed that the system has begun production, with a quota of 1000 units a day per worker. The system is slightly larger than its predecessor, has a smaller bezel, and will come with black and white Joy-Con controllers. Additionally, the system shows a number 2 logo on the side, suggesting that Nintendo Switch 2 will indeed be the official name of the system.</p>
<p>More information on the new Nintendo console may also have come from a new report by the <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5710/8229942">Taiwan Economic Daily</a>. The report reveals that the new system will be larger than its predecessor, featuring better battery life, some AI features, likely NVIDIA DLSS support, and a dual-screen design. The console's price is estimated to be $400, which is an increase over the launch price of the original Switch but still a reasonable increase compared to the PlayStation 5 Pro price. As for the console's reveal, it is reported that it has been moved in response to the PS5 Pro announcement, but it will still come within the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 is supposedly releasing sometime next year, it likely won't take much longer to finally know which of these many rumors on the system was correct. We will keep you updated on the new console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

        <p>Well, sir, there's nothing on Mars like a genuine bona-fide electrified six-car monorail</p>

Efforts to render Mars commuter-friendly proceed apace as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mars-first-logistics">Mars First Logistics</a> embraces the magic of trains. The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.</p>
<p>If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDOI0cq6GZM">It's more of a Shelbyville idea</a>. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Here’s a trailer for the new update.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
The new building functionality – unlocked by obtaining the Scout blueprint, which replaces the Buggy blueprint - comes with new building missions, but you don’t have to do missions in order to build stuff. You will, of course, still have to traverse the terrain in your rover while erecting infrastructure, so vehicle construction remains the soul of the game.
</p>
<p>
“A new contract type has been added that tasks you with connecting different stations using various structures,” MacLarty explains in a Steam post. “For example you might be asked to build a water pipe between a reservoir and a habitat. You are, however, free to build structures wherever you like.
</p>
<p>
“Transmitters are now also structures that you need to build yourself instead of discovering,” he continues. “They have a small cost and need to have line-of-site to each other, which brings a new dynamic to exploring the landscape.”
</p>
<p>
Speaking of landscapes, these are now garlanded with clouds, which apparently is a reflection of there <em>actually</em> being clouds on Mars, and not just a calming aesthetic flourish, nosirree. MacLarty and the team at Shape Shop have also carried out some smaller improvements and fixes, as below.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    • Increased camera zoom.
      
    • The grapple hook now works on terrain by default.
      
    • The fair contracts are now unlocked together with the other areas, giving you more options from the start.
      
    • More accurate map fog.
      
    • Fixed a bug with the wind turbine delivery zone in co-op.
      
    • Various other minor fixes and tweaks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The game’s next update will probably be on the piecemeal and incremental side, with a more substantial one to follow next year. Again, MacLarty has big plans for that theodolite. “I feel like we've just scratched the surface of where this new system could go,” he writes. “For example I'm thinking it might be nice to integrate rocket refueling with the fuel pipe lines. Perhaps you have to connect stations to the fuel grid before you can refuel at them?” Yes yes, MacLarty, sounds good, but that’s not a rollercoaster, is it. Where are my loop-de-loops? 
</p>
<p>
“Mars First Logistics is even more delightful than it looks,” Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mars-first-logistics-is-even-more-delightful-than-it-looks">wrote last July</a>, praising the game’s “approachable design” and “smooth controls”. It looks like it’s come along nicely since then.

<p>An image of Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s physical case recently surfaced online, and it confirmed that the roster will feature ‘more than 180 characters’, among other details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was earlier believed that the game would feature 164 characters at launch, but according to the image posted by reliable Dragon Ball news source, <a href="https://x.com/DbsHype/status/1835192868555620861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hype</a>, there are even more to come. With Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s GT characters trailer, Bandai Namco has officially revealed 154 characters. Players speculate that the characters from the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-roster-leak-confirms-movie-characters-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> will fill the remaining roster, and a Goku Daima variant will be announced as a pre-order bonus.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero <a href="https://x.com/Kaiser_Xeno/status/1835196098002272688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PS5</a> case has confused some players as it includes two different requirements for multiple categories. The storage case says 100 GB minimum at the top and 65 GB minimum at the bottom. The multiplayer details also differ, as one says 2-8 network players, and the other says 2-6 network players. Moreover, the case also states that the game will feature in-game purchases, vibration function, and trigger effect support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero case highlights two other details and the roster: “Immersive Stages” and “Iconic &amp; Novel Episodes.” The back cover also features an image of a face-off between Cell and Beerus, which many players speculate is one of the instances from a story episode in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s composer Petri Alanko has teased some pretty emotional-sounding stuff for the game's upcoming DLC, The Lake House.</p>
<p>In a handful of social media posts shared over the weekend, Alanko said he was editing vocals for the DLC, calling it "by far the hardest thing I've ever run into". And why is that? Well, it is because the composer is being constantly brought to tears by his work.</p>

</figure>
<p>"It's a damn ugly snot cry, not some posing-in-a-pic glycerin prop tear. Absolutely amazing stuff [is] coming," Alanko wrote on X. "I wish I could say more."</p>
<p>Remedy's Sam Lake then piped up, stating he "might have written some lyrics to sum up the whole journey leading to and through Alan Wake 2". To this, Alanko replied: "I noticed only two or three consecutive lines of the lyrics - about anywhere - were enough to surface the emotions."</p>
<p>Alanko admitted he was surprised by this, as he isn't one to be "easily shaken". That said, the "honesty of it all stoned down all my defences", the composer wrote. </p>
<p>"It's a thousand yard stare put into words. Damn brilliant."</p>
<p>I am now hopeful that Alan Wake 2's The Lake House DLC - which is currently slated to release this October - features some kind of musical scene akin to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2s-herald-of-darkness-aka-this-years-best-video-game-song-just-got-an-official-music-video">base game's Herald of Darkness section</a>. This is, perhaps, unlikely, though, given <a href="https://x.com/Peppepappa/status/1834660797428949106">Alanko said</a> while the track is "not hidden", he still worries "no one else will get the same emotions from That Track or if anyone will ever even hear it".</p>
<p>"Ah well, life is a risk, but the thing is I had planned to deliver a final mix today, but I just _couldn't_," he closed.</p>

<p>As for what the upcoming DLC is actually all about, <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-faq/">Remedy</a> has the following to say:</p>
<p>"The Lake House is a mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organisation to conduct secret research... until something goes wrong.</p>
<p>"Explore the Lake House and embark on an adventure as the realities of the Pacific Northwest and the Dark Place collide again."</p>
<p>The first of Alan Wake 2's DLCs arrived earlier this year. Night Springs, as it is called, included a trio of 'What if' tales featuring familiar characters, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2s-deliciously-bizarre-night-springs-dlc-out-this-weekend-physical-version-finally-due-later-this-year">Alan Wake 2's biggest Alan Wake fan Rose the Waitress</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kitase commented on fan conjecture around how much the story will change from the original, as part of an interview with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2024-09-13/recreating-a-video-game-classic-with-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-naoki-hamaguchi-yoshinori-kitase-and-/.213851">Anime News Network</a>, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi and battle director Teruki Endo.</p>
<p>"We've always kept the original in mind, and I don't think it's going to be a storyline that will betray the fans of the original [game]," he said. "But also, at the same time, [it's] been 27 years since the release of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>. There are these things we feel we can only do now in the remake project that can bring a new happiness, a new sort of feeling of satisfaction to the players playing this game now 27 years later. What this will entail exactly is something we hope players will experience soon."</p>

<p>Kitase's comment is certainly interesting considering speculation of how the third part could alter the original story. While Remake suggested major changes to the narrative in future games, Rebirth mostly stuck to the script but wrapped in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">convoluted multiverse plot that has proven controversial among some fans</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> now has the difficult job of wrapping up the story in the final part of the trilogy, appeasing fans of the original as well as tying up multiple Remake threads.</p>
<p>In fact, Hamaguchi said the development team wanted to include something "worthy of intense discussion" between game releases, which resulted in the ending focused on Aerith's fate. "In terms of the experience we anticipated and also desired, I think we are satisfied in that there are both negative or positive reactions to this scene," Hamaguchi noted.</p>
<p>"Regarding the original," added Kitase, "its [first disc] ends with that huge loss. And I recall some people not even wanting to continue playing and changing over to disc two because they didn't want to play anymore because of that. It's such a huge feeling of loss and despair, but I do think there's a synchronisation of feelings between the players and Cloud, struggling with 'How do I deal with this feeling?' The feeling of loss and how a person struggled to take that on was happening. We imagined the players of [Rebirth] would also have that synchronous feeling."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kitase was asked about the presumed console exclusivity window of the third part in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">Rebirth reportedly underperforming</a>. While he didn't provide a firm comment, he said the development team was "looking forward to more players enjoying and playing this title".</p>
<p>Additionally, Endo spoke of wanting to give players more freedom in the third game. "While I'm unable to comment on granular details of that right at this moment, I believe that instead of the developers or the creators dictating how the players should play along a pre-planned path, so to speak, it's better to allow more freedom and the user's choice to be able to play in their own way that they wish to," he said.</p>
<p>"While naturally, there are challenges to actually realising that, and when you go into making that a reality, my thoughts are also that for the Final Fantasy series to continue to reinvent itself, to revitalise itself, and stay fresh to our players, this type of constant evolution is necessary in terms of the battle elements as well."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I interviewed Kitase where we discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-is-a-toy-box-says-series-producer-yoshinori-kitase">essence of the Final Fantasy series</a>. "We talk about Final Fantasy as being a toy box," he said. "The idea that you take the lid off the toy box and you've got all kinds of different things in there. There's a dinosaur here, you've got your football here and your baseball here. And there are so many different things to play with and have fun. And that to me, that's what Final Fantasy is."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Happy this week, everybody! The squirrels are trying to kill me. There's a massive horse chestnut tree outside my flat, and whenever I walk under it they drop conkers on my head. The squirrels are clearly Maw cultists. They want to give me a concussion and choke off the supply of video game news to the Maw, which will then manifest fully and bring about an age of darkness. Well, the joke's on you, squirrels, because I used to play grass hockey as a kid and I've been hit in the head by hard round objects a million times over. How else do you explain my choice of career? Anyway, here's a curated list of PC games that are out in the next five days.</p><!--more-->

He went on to say: "I can call Flappy Bird a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it." Nguyen has largely avoided the limelight since.</p><p>10 years later, an organization calling itself the 'Flappy Bird Foundation' has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-years-after-it-was-pulled-offline-viral-mobile-game-flappy-bird-is-coming-back">announced plans to bring Flappy Bird back</a> alongside a trailer, below, that leans on nostalgia for the original game, but without any mention of Nguyen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation said it was founded in 2023 and “is led by a dedicated team of passionate fans and industry veterans who share a deep love for Flappy Bird and sought to rescue the iconic gameplay and IP for the community of over 100 million enthusiasts.”</p><p>“The Flappy Bird Foundation is committed to preserving the Flappy Bird IP and expanding the legacy of Flappy Bird,” it said. “By faithfully bringing back our classic and nostalgic gameplay while introducing new elements, the Foundation aims to give back to the global fan community that created the phenomenon.”</p><p>However, eyebrows were raised by the involvement of Michael Roberts, who is said to be “the chief creative” behind Flappy Bird’s return. Roberts is founder of 1208 Productions, a mobile game developer heavily involved with NFTs and cryptocurrency, including the NFT brand 'Deez.'</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/16/gettyimages-468280817-1726474874628.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen in 2014. Photo credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Roberts now faces questions about how he came to own the Flappy Bird trademark. The Flappy Bird Foundation said it had “acquired” the official Flappy Bird trademark rights from a company called Gametech Holdings LLC, along with the rights for the original game and character Piou Piou vs. Cactus, the mobile title “that has long been credited as originally inspiring the iconic bird.”</p><p>It turns out that Gametech had filed an opposition to Nguyen’s Flappy Bird trademark last year, claiming he had abandoned it. After Nguyen failed to respond to various trademark notices, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) declared Nguyen’s original Flappy Bird trademark abandoned. Then, in January this year, the USPTO terminated Nguyen’s claim to it.</p><p>Web developer and cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varun Biniwale</a> subsequently dug into the website of this new Flappy Bird game and found reference to Web 3.0. Biniwale even discovered builds of the game, which incorporate cryptocurrency and NFTs.</p><p>Now, Nguyen has broken his silence with a solitary tweet. In it, he insisted he has no involvement with the new Flappy Bird, he “did not sell anything,” and: “I also don’t support crypto.” It is Nguyen’s first tweet since retweeting a game trailer in 2017.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, I have no related with their game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/nba-2k25-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The NBA 2K series has long been up there as one of the best sporting video games, each year putting forward a great recreation of basketball that always makes the most of each era of console hardware. But for over a decade there’s always been the looming shadow of VC, the microtransactions that have spread to almost every fact of the experience. Does NBA 2K25 strike a better balance in that regard than previous games? Yes and no.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K25 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qx0A921z8mA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first thing you will see on the home screen is a pop up to go to the current season and buy Virtual Currency (VC), which you might easily open up by mistake when hurriedly tapping through to reach MyCareer. This kind of splash screen is increasingly common in mass market video games, but the difference, as always, is that 2K is pushing people to spend more in an already full priced game to get a leg up for your character.</p>


<p>Once you actually reach the main menu, you have a choice between&nbsp;MyCareer, MyTeam, NBA Eras which includes MyGM, and WNBA. Most players, myself included, will head to MyCareer as that is where a lot of the action is. In NBA 2K25, there are new options to create your player, including Pro Builds. With Pro Builds you select some aspects for your player, like position and playstyle, and NBA 2K25 will pull a few players that your build is similar to and base your stats on them. Do not expect a powerhouse player, as you will start as rookie with a rating of 60.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this review, we were provided with 100,000 VC, which I did spend on improving my player’s attributes. This amount moved the needle from a 60 rating to a 76 rating, which is mid-range for the vast majority of NBA players, but well off the top. I would suspect another 100,000 would get my player to the mid-80s. For context, 200,000 VC is priced at $49.99.</p>


<p>In MyCareer you select the team you want to play for and are already part of the squad, though your first goal is to become a starter. MyCareer brings back the city hub with quests to complete, side content like kart racing, a gym, practice areas, and boss matches against the CPU. There are also lots of shops to spend your VC in for clothing for your player. The cheapest options I found cost 1,500 VC, and there are dozens of apparel options. Spending VC on this means not spending it to improve your player’s attributes, which was my main focus. Some of the quests to provide VC as a reward and they are worth checking out, especially the 3v3 boss battles across the three different arenas in the City. They’re tough but a fun distraction. The go-karting, though, feels very floaty.</p>
<p>If you have played MyCareer before you will know what to expect. In the NBA games you only control your player, and not the rest of the team, which can be both fine and frustrating. Team chemistry has to be built over the long term with the on the court and off the court actions impacting it. The higher the chemistry the more likely your teammates will take notice of you, and not ignore your calls for passes or make silly plays. For example, my player passing to our open 3 point shooter, who instead of shooting decides to drive to the post for a 2 pointer and miss, or my player getting into an open lane with no defence covering me, only for the call for the pass to be ignored and the ball get turned over instead.</p>
<p>This impacts your own teammate ranking, which in turn can impact the outcome of a game, and how much VC you earn. The most I have earned so far is around 800 VC, after getting a B+ team ranking and winning the game. The grind is very much alive in MyCareer.</p>

<p>MyGM is the much better option, in my view, to play. For a start VC isn’t really a factor here, except as a reward post-match depending on the outcome, and you can instead focus on just running an NBA franchise as well as playing the games on court. You can control everything from the staff in your franchise, organising and negotiating player trades, and dealing with the day to day running of an NBA franchise.</p>
<p>You interact with staff members around the office, as they pitch ideas and give advice, with you making the call to pursue or reject suggestions. Maybe it is worth trying to get a past prospect back into the game, despite the injuries and personal issues they have had, and maybe the cost of a fan day would outweigh its benefits. As the GM it is your call, and I would definitely encourage more players to engage with that side of NBA 2K25, because that is where the real shine of the game is.</p>

<p>The on the court action is very well presented, and the level of polish is something we have come to expect from the NBA 2K franchise. The player likenesses and on the court animations, of which there are thousands more, really mimic the real life counterparts. The gameplay is generally very smooth, though some camera angles are definitely better than others. For MyCareer, the standard camera is fine, whereas in full team games the broadcast and full court view is much better.</p>
<p>The shooting does still feel off at times with a slight millisecond difference could determine a shot being excellent, which will always drop, or slightly early and slightly late which have less chances of dropping. Sometimes, it is not even clear what shots will go in the basket with early rated shots going in, whereas something you’d expect to doesn’t. This is down to the shot meters, of which there are three to choose from, not feeling entirely accurate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pearl Abyss has published the longest gameplay video preview yet for its upcoming title Crimson Desert. If you've been following the game, you know it has had a rather lengthy development.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at G-Star 2019 alongside PLAN 8 and DokeV, it was scheduled to launch in Winter 2021, but Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to delay indefinitely. Crimson Desert re-emerged with a brief gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> for Gamescom 2023, which proved it was alive and well.</p>
<p>The recent Gamescom 2024 was even more important, as that was the first time the game was actually playable. I got to try it myself while there, although it was a brief session <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused entirely on boss fights</a>. The demo allowed players to select between various bosses and fight them right away without much context or narrative involved. The fights were rather tough; thankfully, the demo included the ability to resurrect the player character after defeat, so we didn't have to start every boss fight from scratch, which would have been a problem given the limited time. The combat system is heavily combo-based and already pretty fun, mostly because every attack felt satisfyingly weighty and crunchy.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't equally impressed with the visuals. It's not that they are bad, but they do seem to inherit what I always believed was a glaring flaw from Black Desert Online - a certain roughness that kind of ruined the otherwise great graphics. Crimson Desert is based on the same engine as BDO and similarly looks like it has little to no anti-aliasing. I sincerely hope Pearl Abyss finds some way to fix this ahead of the launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert – 50 Minutes of Early Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ItNYP9U1M0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Which is still nowhere in sight, mind you. Despite the Gamescom 2024 demo and this fresh extended gameplay video preview, Crimson Desert still has no release window, and that's not the only unknown. I asked Pearl Abyss whether it would feature multiplayer support as originally planned, and they told me it hadn't been decided yet, which means the full feature set still has to be finalized. Recent rumors mentioned two potential launch windows: <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2025</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q2 2025</a>. I would put my money on the latter, particularly on the final part of the quarter, toward May or June, as the most likely candidates.</p>

            <p>Goichi 'Suda51' Suda - of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-heroes-3">No More Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/killer7">Killer7</a> fame - reckons a focus on Metacritic scores is bad for creativity. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suda51-everyone-cares-too-much-about-metacritic-scores">GI.biz </a>recently alongside survival<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games"> horror</a> genre maker-upper Shinji Mikami, Suda expressed his frustrations with the review aggregator platform’s cultural cache.</p>
<p>"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.</p>

<p>"If you've got a game that doesn't fit into that formula, that marketability scope, it loses points on Metacritic. The bigger companies might not want to deal with that kind of thing. That might not be the main reason, but that's certainly one reason why. Everyone cares too much about the numbers.”</p>
<p>Mikami chimed in too, adding that he believes that small, more interesting games get less attention “because of all the big budget games that are out there and all the power that's put into the marketing for them."</p>
<p>"The kind of games that get the most marketing support are the ones that need to appeal to as broad an audience as possible," said Mikami. "More unique games don't really have the same marketability."</p>
<p>These are, of course, not especially new sentiments - Metacritic’s dominance as the last word on a game’s quality has been regularly called out as an oppressive influence for quite some time now. There’s been a few famous cases of bonuses being withheld from studios for not hitting a certain threshold, namely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/metacritic-matters-how-review-scores-hurt-video-games-472462218">Writing for Kotaku</a> over a decade ago, Jason Schreier explored the aggregator’s harmful influence, saying “Metacritic is a useful tool, but video game publishers have turned it into a weapon.”</p>
<p>As a writer who has occasionally been known to put a score on a game on the internet, I have my own issues with Metacritic - namely how its reductive translation of stars into numbers tends to flatten nuance even more than review scores naturally do anyway, sometimes inviting harassment on critics for the unforgivable crime of saying a game the audience has already decided is a masterpiece is simply ‘good'. Rightly or not, 6/10 carries different connotations to three stars.</p>
<p>The conversation came about as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/a-second-chance-for-shinji-mikami-and-suda51s-lesser-known-collaboration">GI.biz’s longer interview with the two</a>, where they discussed the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadows-damned">Shadows of the Damned</a>: Hella Remastered - a normal, regular remaster of the 2011 third-person shooter. The interview also covers another ill-fated collaboration between the two that never saw the light of day - Zombie Rider.</p>
<p>"Maybe it just wasn't fucked up enough," said Suda of the game. "If it was a bit more fucked up, maybe Mikami would have been into it. But it just didn't have that level of 'what the hell is going on in this game?'"</p>

            <p>For all the nightmarish enshittification modern life throws at us, we can at least feel warm and fulfilled about the resurgence of demos. Bountifully they await on Steam, like a friendly worker offering you toothpick-skewered cheese chunks at your local supermarket. And, oh, would you look at that: this cheese has some guns in it. Deeply customisable guns! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sulfur">SULFUR</a> is a shooty roguelike with some excellent goblins and a deep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> equipment system. And, if the Steam reviews are to be believed, some players are squeezing out dozens of hours from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2845200/SULFUR_Demo/">demo alone</a>.</p>

<p>The core of this everlasting cheese-stopper is dungeon crawling and working on your build. To aid you in your goblin bashing, you’ll discover a variety of guns upgrades, spell ingredients, and other equipment, then combine them in creative ways to make fun violence happen.</p>
<p>“I love violence, but I need context!” you bellow. Please, calm yourself. Here you go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plan ahead to outsmart enemies and progress through a world of dark creatures and cunning evil. Utilize playful and tactile weaponry in visceral and intense combat. Make creative builds with weapons, equipment, tools and enchantments to aid your quest. Be a gun-blazing risktaker or carefully plan out strategies. There's plenty of playstyles - the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Experience the atmosphere, suspense and tribulation of a world in redemption. What happened? Why did it happen? Travel through misty vales, dark forests, sordid Black Guild shanties and pass through castle walls and beyond. Go deeper, head on. Answers come to those who listen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this one because someone on Twazzer was praising the roadmap, which contains such milestones as “fixing shit” and “guns &amp; magic”. Also, sometimes the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124120/SULFUR/">patch notes</a> contain rhubarb sauce recipes. I don’t like rhubarb, but I do like this. It’s out in October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-rated-for-playstation-5-in-taiwan/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhammer 40K Darktide appears to be headed to Sony's PlayStation 5 console. The news comes from the ever-helpful Taiwanese rating board (<a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1835519789847978106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Gematsu</a>), which recently rated this new version ahead of any announcement from developer Fatshark.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Darktide is currently only available on PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, it is likely that Microsoft only secured a timed exclusivity deal rather than a definitive exclusivity deal, and the Xbox Series S|X version <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on October 4, 2023. Most timed exclusivity deals are one year long, so Fatshark might be about to launch the PS5 version in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The game originally debuted on PC in late 2022, but it was in rough shape back then. The studio spent a long time afterward fleshing out key systems like loot and class. The next big overhaul is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-details-itemization-preview-and-brief-qa-with-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">itemization</a>. The two new major systems are called Mastery and Expertise.</p>
<p>Mastery is the core progression system tied to the weapon type/family. As players use a particular weapon, they'll gain more experience, unlocking new blessings, perks, tokens, and a special weapon cosmetic via the Reward Tracks. As they progress, the potential quality and stats of the weapon will also increase.</p>
<p>Mastery will merge all weapon types/families, meaning Warhammer 40K Darktide players will get to freely switch between different brands of the same weapon type. For example, if you own an Infantry Lasgun, you can unlock all the possible marks for that weapon and switch from one mark to another.</p>
<p>When you view a weapon, you will see the weapon's maximum potential stats (which are randomly determined). It's up to the player to decide if the weapon's profile is interesting enough to commit to and to increase the stats until they reach that potential (which will then be applied to the weapon through the expertise system).</p>
<p>While the Mastery system is where a player unlocks a weapon's potential, the Expertise system is where players apply those changes through crafting. Players will be able to configure the weapon, change the blessings or perks, and increase the stats. They will no longer be locked out after making two changes to perks or blessings. They will be using resources to make these changes.</p>

<p>The itemization update titled Locked &amp; Loaded will be released on September 26. Obviously, it will be included with the PS5 version when it launches in the near future.</p>
