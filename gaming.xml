            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding and Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima recently revealed how repeated visits to the 1970 World Expo (Expo ‘70) as a child had a “life-changing” impact on him, profoundly shaping his outlook as a game developer. In a separate piece, the legendary video game auteur shared how he had a very different experience of the current Expo 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-metal-gear-and-death-stranding-wouldnt-exist-without-the-globalist-and-futuristic-outlook-he-learned-from-1970s-osaka-world-expo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, the 62-year-old Kojima <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/55165" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote an essay</u></a> for An-An magazine detailing how Expo '70 shaped his worldview: "Without that Expo, I wouldn’t have developed my future-oriented and globalized outlook. Metal Gear and Death Stranding would not have come into being."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Osaka hosted the Expo '70, with 76 countries and 32 organizations participating (source: <a href="https://taiyounotou-expo70.jp/en/about/expo70/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Expo '70 Commemorative Park official website</u></a>). Kojima said that at the time he had just started elementary school and lived near the event site. This gave him the opportunity to visit the Expo many times.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2222468111-1759999722848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima has revealed how visiting an Expo in 1970 shaped his worldview. Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I could even go after school on weekdays," he recalled, borrowing his dad’s brand new camera (the Ricoh Auto Half Expo '70 Model) and snapping loads of photos. "Whenever you entered a pavilion, you received a badge," he remembered, adding that children proudly showed off their collections to each other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main theme of Expo '70 was 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind.' It even had its own theme song — Haruo Minami’s 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from the countries of the world), which Kojima quoted in his essay — with lyrics that focus on saying "hello" and "holding hands" across countries and borders (the song is on <a href="https://youtu.be/NyRgp8r0mwo?si=73PZdSfGxM561D8U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a> with English subtitles).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the Expo, I experienced 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind' up close. I said 'hello' and 'shook hands' with (avant-garde artist) Taro Okamoto, (sci-fi novelist) Sakyo Komatsu, (architects) Kenzo Tange and Kisho Kurokawa, and (fashion designers) Junko Koshino and Hanae Mori. It was all a shocking 'close encounter of the third kind,'" Kojima remembered. "Technology, science, design, fashion, history, the world, culture, society. You could say that that 'hello' back then shaped who I became. 'Shaking hands' with the Expo changed my life and my vision of the future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima explained that "the Expo's greatness wasn't just in the glimpses it offered of cutting-edge technology and the daily life of the future. It showed me the global diversity of nations, ethnicities, races, religions, customs, and histories. It embodied the essence of 'past and future' and 'the world and harmony.' Without that Expo, I wouldn’t have developed my future-oriented and globalized outlook. Metal Gear and Death Stranding would not have come into being."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the major attractions of Expo '70 was the Moon Rock at the U.S. pavilion, which had been brought back from the Moon by Apollo 12 astronauts the previous year. Despite his many visits, Kojima said that "unfortunately, the U.S. pavilion, where I’d hoped to see the Moon Rock, was too crowded, so I never got to see it with my own eyes." He also recalled waiting over two hours to get into the U.S.S.R pavilion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does Kojima feel about the current Expo 2025 that is being held in Osaka, and how did his experience compare? In a <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/67790" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>follow-up essay</u></a> published in An-An, Kojima wrote about visiting Expo 2025 on a very rainy day, camera in tow again: "I wanted to see for myself how 'globalism' and 'visions of the future' have changed over the past 55 years, and how the baton will be passed on (to future generations)." However, the experience gave Kojima a "strange feeling."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Metal Gear Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer explained: "I didn't get that sense of a tremendous future like I did as a child (at Expo '70). It wasn't thrilling or exciting. Just a ceaseless, predictable tomorrow stretching on and on. It wasn't that there was no 'future' — rather that I couldn't ascertain the next 'tomorrow' for myself. The 'future' I dreamed of at that (1970) Expo — I've already experienced most of it. Robots, videophones and moving walkways have become commonplace. The tomorrow that this (2025) Expo promotes is one that children will witness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima gave the opinion that World Expos are primarily for children, as they are the ones who will take mankind into the future. Whether the futuristic designs at the 2025 Expo will be representative of what the real future will be is "something old people can never know." However, Kojima added that he enjoyed the Expo: "Although I will not be able to experience this future firsthand, I plan to go again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any player of Metal Gear Solid or Death Stranding doesn’t have to look far to see how both series feature diverse casts of characters, with stories often set in the near future that grapple with both the tremendous possibilities and dangers of technology. MGS1 explored genetic engineering and the concept of gene-therapy enhanced soldiers, MGS2 delved into the dangers of internet censorship and human-sounding AI chatbots (making it an interesting revisit in 2025), while MGS4 showed a mech-filled future in which paramilitary conglomerates wage endless wars for profit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its Chiral Network, Death Stranding holds up a mirror to the benefits and dangers of the internet and digital society, and the struggle to reconnect a fragmented, post-apocalyptic world. Legacy and passing on the future to subsequent generations are also big Kojima themes, and it seems they were shaped by his childhood experiences of Expo '70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a side note, the Expo '70 site is still open to the public today, although all the pavilions that awed the young Kojima have since been demolished. Now called the Expo'70 Commemorative Park, it still features the event's symbolic Tower of the Sun, a sculpture by Taro Okamoto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has assembled its largest ever cast of Halloween crossovers in time for the game's latest Fortnitemares celebrations, including Wednesday Addams, though the event's announcement got off to a messy start last night due to a social media snafu involving rap star Doja Cat and mention of a sex toy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's spooky shenanigans are partly centered on musician and self-proclaimed Fortnite fan Doja Cat, who <a href="https://youtu.be/OdE3Qyy61kw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently popped up on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</a> to officially reveal her in-game alter ego Mother of Thorns — and is a boss character during the event. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, Fortnite hosted a brief Doja Cat "takeover" of its X account in advance of the above trailer being released. However, the idea quickly turned messy when "Doja Cat," via Fortnite's account, seemingly posting a reference to "rose toys" (a vibrating adult toy). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back on Doja Cat's <em>actual</em> X account, the rapper broke the fourth wall and stated that Fortnite's posts were all pre-planned, and that she'd told Epic Games not to make the sex toys reference. "S*** cringe as f*** now I'm embarrassed," Doja Cat wrote, followed by a wilted rose emoji. Fortnite then deleted the post referencing "rose toys" shortly after. Doja Cat then deleted all of her messages referencing the incident.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/08/untitled-1-1759952211464.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite and Doja Cat's now-deleted posts. Image credit: X / IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some onlookers have suggested the whole incident was planned, including Doja Cat's typically-messy fourth wall break. But that theory would seem to rely on Fortnite itself being comfortable posting about an adult toy on its social media account which is followed by millions of young fans, which seems unlikely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you'll be able to snap up a Doja Cat skin from Fortnite's Shop, alongside an array of other famous faces. These include (deep breath): Wednesday Addams, Jason Voorhees, Scooby-Doo (plus also Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred), Black Phone's Grabber, Terrifier's Art the Clown, Ghostface and... even more. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2238260585-1759997531382.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doja Cat's Jimmy Fallon appearance, sitting on her Fortnite crown of thorns.

As for Fortnite itself, its new spooky gameplay extends beyond the game's main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes. A fresh Reload map, Nitemare Island, will debut tomorrow, October 10, featuring a Halloween-themed town and looming castle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Fortnitemares comes hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-fortnite-reveals-kpop-demon-hunters-rumi-outfit">the game's big KPop Demon Hunters collaboration</a>, which will run until November 1.

Oh, and $20 billion in debt.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The move will see EA become a private company, but a lot of questions around what could become the largest leveraged buyout ever (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/electronic-arts-go-private-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-2025-09-29/">according to Reuters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) remain. In search of answers, we spoke to a number of analysts to understand how the&nbsp;seismic&nbsp;buyout could impact Electronic Arts' thousands of employees, its products, and the wider video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of how the deal is structured, the new ownership group will collectively contribute $36 billion, with the final $20 billion coming via debt financed through JP Morgan Chase Bank. The sale will take Electronic Arts off the stock market and place it into the hands of private equity investors, but the pressure of that $20 billion in debt is looming large.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The move is called a leveraged buyout because a portion of the deal is financed through debt. There's a chance the company could kick on and generate a profit. Or it might become overwhelmed by that debt and go bankrupt—which is precisely what happened when private equity firms purchased Toys R Us in 2005 in a $6.6 billion deal that saddled the company with $5 billion in debt.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" target="_self" data-discover="true">Heart Machine making layoffs and ending development on Hyper Light Breaker</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The retailer filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and Canada in 2017 because any cash it did make was used to pay off that debt,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketplace.org/story/2019/06/12/a-look-back-at-kkr-the-investment-firm-that-bought-out-toys-r-us-among-others">according to Marketplace</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The difference here is that Toys R Us was in worse shape than Electronic Arts at the time of its sale, struggling to compete with online marketplaces like Amazon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The $55 billion buyout saddles EA with debt that only makes sense through new revenue streams&quot;">"The $55 billion buyout saddles EA with debt that only makes sense through new revenue streams"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PitchBook gaming analyst Eric Bellomo told Game Developer that "the record of leveraged buyouts is mixed," pointing to the failures of Toys R Us and Joann Fabrics but the success of Hilton and Dell. Silver Lake, in particular, will be a boon to this endeavor, he said: "Silver Lake brings meaningful experience in gaming through its position in Unity and a strong track record of top-quartile funds. Historically, the firm has performed as a third-quartile manager overall."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, market research and consulting firm DFC Intelligence founder David Cole explained leveraged buyouts remain "high risk" and often result in "asset sales and short term cost cutting" in the hopes of delivering long-term success. "It all comes down to execution and that remains to be seen," he added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-nexon-ceo-criticizes-fad-obsessed-industry-executives" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Nexon CEO criticizes fad-obsessed industry executives</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Electronic Arts has significant revenue flow—$7.5 billion in fiscal year 2025—that will be important in paying off its debt. But, according to New York University School of Business assistant professor Joost van Dreunen, the company will likely shift priorities to focus on its most profitable areas. He told Game Developer that means potential layoffs and, perhaps, the sale of "dormant IP" like Command &amp; Conquer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The $55 billion buyout saddles EA with debt that only makes sense through new revenue streams—likely sports betting and integrated media ventures," van Dreunen said in an email. "Going private removes Wall Street's quarterly pressure, allowing for more creative freedom. However, restructuring will follow. EA will likely split into sports and non-sports divisions, with some operations potentially relocated to Saudi Arabia. For studios, this means freedom from earnings calls but closer oversight from investors pursuing geopolitical objectives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Electronic Arts said in an employee FAQ made public through a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-55-billion-take-private-won-t-result-in-immediate-layoffs">that there will be no "immediate" changes to jobs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, teams, or daily work—i.e., no "immediate" layoffs. How long is immediate? That's the question for Electronic Arts employees as the closing date for the deal draws nearer.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/calling-partners-for-gdc-2026-deadline-extended-to-friday-10-10-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Calling partners for GDC 2026! Deadline extended to Friday, October 10</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen said a "culture shift begins immediately," even though the closure is months away. "Once a sale is finalized, priorities shift overnight toward strategic alignment with buyer objectives," he added. "Expect EA's management to quietly reorganize around sports and live-service divisions in anticipation of new ownership. Going private also buys CEO Andrew Wilson time to prove </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can anchor the post-merger narrative."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventual layoffs and restructuring are "inevitable," he claimed, as the company reviews its assets. Cole, from DFC Intelligence, said the nature of debt means cutbacks often follow, along with the divestment of "non-essential assets."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We see EA doubling down on their high profile sports games and live services," Cole said. "They may look to sell [off other studios and franchises] to pay off debt. You may see EA shopping around some of its smaller franchises/studios."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen agreed. He said the new owners will likely focus on Electronic Arts' sports franchises, which drive a ton of revenue, meaning the rest of the publisher's catalog could face "aggressive 'right-sizing' ahead of potential sell-offs."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bellomo suggested that mobile gaming, and, of course, Battlefield, could drive the future of Electronic Arts.&nbsp;"EA is almost certainly evaluating potential synergies in mobile gaming, vis-a-vis Scopely in particular, and preparing for the upcoming launch of Battlefield, which will remain a key focus in the months ahead," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bellomo feels&nbsp;the company's broad strategy is unlikely to shift dramatically as Electronic Arts continues to rely on "core cash-generating franchises and steady revenue streams from in-app purchases, microtransactions, and similar sources."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Saudi Arabia and other investors are adding capital to acquire cultural legitimacy&quot;">"Saudi Arabia and other investors are adding capital to acquire cultural legitimacy"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen noted that this particular leveraged buyout is a little different than others due to Saudi Arabia's involvement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Gaming is the new oil," van Dreunen said. "Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is leveraging it to purchase global cultural relevance while diversifying beyond petroleum. With nearly 60 percent of Saudis, approximately 21 million people, playing games, and the domestic market projected to grow 56 percent to $2.8 billion by 2026, EA represents the crown jewel in [Saudi Arabia capital] Riyadh's Vision 2030 strategy to establish itself as a global gaming hub."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He continued: "This LBO diverges from the traditional playbook: instead of cutting costs to service debt, Saudi Arabia and other investors are adding capital to acquire cultural legitimacy. They're likely indifferent to short-term margins, viewing EA as a long-term anchor for broader entertainment ambitions. This could temporarily insulate EA from layoffs and creative risk aversion, though debt always comes due eventually."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saudi Arabia's investment into the video game industry is part of a larger strategy to acquire that cultural cache, with the country having already sunk billions into the games and esports industries through its Public Investment Fund.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This year, Saudi-owned esports and video game firm&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pokemon-go-and-niantic-s-game-business-is-being-sold-to-the-saudi-state">Savvy Games Group acquired the majority of Pokemon Go maker Niantic's video game business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;for $3.5 billion.

"Once state-backed investors treat games as geopolitical assets, the floodgates open," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That means bigger budgets, fewer exits, and politics embedded in content decisions.

            <p>Veteran game developers from Zenimax Online Studios have announced the formation of a new employee-owned game development company: Sackbird Studios. The small team is composed of several developers from both The Elder Scrolls: Online team, and those who were working on the cancelled sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird.</p>
<p>This new studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity">formed in the wake of widespread layoffs at Zenimax Online Studios</a>, is employee-owned according to the announcement <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">posted on its fresh-faced website</a>. It has a runway for multiple years, and is apparently totally self-funded. This means the devs at Sackbird have a few years to make a game off their own dime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">without any stockholders or massive international corporations getting involved in things</a>.</p>
<p>This announcement came with a bit of context as to the studio's formation. Project Blackbird's cancellation seemingly acted as the push Sackbird's founders needed to go their own way, with the new studio aimed at "avoiding pitfalls" the team have seen firsthand.</p>

<p>David Worley, COO at Sackbird Studios, wrote as part of this announcement: "After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets [...] We're fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>Lee Ridout, CEO at Sackbird Games, also added his own statement, writing: "We're grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people [...] When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft--and our team--was to create a studio where creative independence isn't negotiable."</p>
<p>Following the cancellation of the in-development MMO, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-head-matt-firor-announces-departure-following-widespread-layoffs-and-the-cancellation-of-in-development-mmo">Zenimax Online Studios head Matt Firor left the company</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft allegedly cancelled plans for a new Assassin's Creed game set in in the aftermath of the American Civil War last year, with online moaning about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> co-protagonist Yasuke and concerns over the volatility of the modern day US political climate being cited as reasons.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Game File</a>, which claims the game would have starred a black former slave who moves westwards from the south in search of a new life. He'd subsequently be recruited by the series' Assassins and return to the south in a story that'd involve confronting the rise of Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction era that spanned the 1860s and 70s.</p>
<p>Game File cites current and former Ubisoft staff who say that the game, which was in the concept phase, was canned in July 2024. Ubisoft management reportedly pointed to online vitriol in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke">black samurai Yasuke</a> being revealed as one of Shadows' protagonists as a reason behind the move, as well as concerns about the US' current political climate. The latter is alleged to have been the bigger factor in the cancellation. As one of Game File's sources put it, the game was viewed as being "too political in a country too unstable".</p>
<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ubisoft-shares-plummet-it-guides-further-cash-burn-2025-05-15/">rocky financial state</a> was also a reported factor in the decision, making execs keen to steer away from perceived risks. "I was terribly disappointed but not surprised by leadership," one of Game File's sources said. "They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political ‘status quo’ and take no stand, no risk, even creative."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's handling of the Yasuke controversy was rather topsy-turvy, with Shadows developers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defending their work</a> while managment types like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">CEO Yves Guillemot</a> tried to pull the old 'no politics here in a video game, please stop thinking we might have thoughts to express in this video game' cop-out.</p><p>It's not like the company hasn't backed games that tackled issues like slavery before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, the beloved entry that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">reportedly getting the remake or remaster tratement at the moment</a>, span-off into Freedom Cry, which tells the tale of former slave Adewale fighting to free slaves in Saint-Domingue. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-liberation">Assassin's Creed III: Liberation</a> deals with similar themes, as you'd expect when making games set in periods of history when colonialism and its effects had a big impact on society and folks' everyday lives.</p>
<p>You can perhaps understand the risk aversion if you only look at the bottom line, but it's depressing to see a game spoken enthusiastically about by its developers be lobbed out of the window because of the state of affairs in modern day America. If anything, that would have made releasing a game exploring these themes even more important and commendable.</p>

<p>Fortnitemares 2025 has kicked off, and Epic Games is going for broke in this year’s content drop, which features the largest ever list of collabs in the event’s history.</p>



<p>The annual Halloween event is a fan-favorite, featuring limited-time content, exclusive skins, and special events in game, and Fortnitemares 2025 is bigger than ever.</p>



<p>It was already revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghostface-scooby-doo-r-e-p-o-coming-in-fortnitemares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O</a> would be featured as collabs, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat appearing as an in-game boss</a>, but the full list of collabs is even more impressive.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-2025-includes-nine-major-collabs">Fortnitemares 2025 Includes Nine Major Collabs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Iconic. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reveals at the start of Fortnitemares have showcased a further five major collabs in the event this year, bringing the grand total up to nine.</p>



<p>Wednesday Addams, from the hit Netflix series, Jason Vorhees, Poppy’s Playtime, and The Terrifier all feature among the collabs in the event, which is due to be available until the end of the current season on November 1.</p>



<p>The content drop includes two Jam Tracks from Doja Cat’s latest album, along with the landmark Season 10 of Fortnite Festival. This time around, rather than focusing on a single artist, the Music Pass is full of hits from stars around the world.</p>



<p>Elton John, Motionless in White, and Fall Out Boy all feature in the Season 10 Music Pass, while there are two Fortnite-original outfits available too.</p>



<p>Season 10 of Fortnite Festival is due to end on November 29, when a new Icon event will begin, which arrives ahead of the start of Season 7, expected in December.</p>

<p>That's Mario &amp; Wario, which originally used the Super Famicom Mouse to control a fairy who guides Mario through each level.

            <p>Fortnitemares is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s Halloween event, and this year it's headlined by rapper Doja Cat alongside horror icons Jason, Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and more.</p>
<p>Players can expect a whole load of horror-themed skins, as well as Nitemare Island as a Fortnite Reload map featuring spooky locations.</p>
<p>The event starts today and runs until 1st November. You can check out the characters in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Two Jam Tracks from Doja Cat's new album Vie are also coming to the game: AAAHH MEN! and Gorgeous.</p>
<p>However, the launch didn't quite go to plan on social media. Doja Cat was meant to take over the Fortnite X account on Wednesday ahead of the Fortnitemares announcement, but the account (which had her in-game avatar as the profile picture) posted a message about "rose toys" some followers presumed was in reference to sex toys.</p>
<p>The rapper herself then responded: "I told them not to man that's not even me. I said this yesterday and then said 'don't post that' :/." The post was quickly taken down, but the exchange was screenshotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/doja-cat-fortnite-sex-toy-deleted-skin-halloween-2025-2000633338">Kotaku</a>.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>X / Kotaku</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And while some followers have suggested it was all planned, it seems unlikely Epic would allow a post about sex toys on the Fortnite account.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Epic to confirm if Doja Cat was behind the posts.</p>
<p>This blunder follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-confirms-no-creative-intentions-connecting-controversial-fortnite-emote-with-peacemaker-tv-show">removal of the Peacemaker dance emote</a> last month due to connotations of Nazism. A revised version of the emote is due back today after Epic confirmed "no creative intentions" connecting the emote with the TV show.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deckard, the Next VR Headset by Valve, Might Have Entered Production]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-next-vr-headset-valve-might-have-entered-production/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deckard-the-next-vr-headset-by-valve-might-have-entered-production.1320460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Chinese analyst group called XR Research Institute has claimed that the next Valve Virtual Reality headset has already entered production and will ship this year, with an estimated initial order of 400K-600K units in the first year. </p>



<p>The news has been <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by UploadVR</a> and confirmed by Valve leakers Tyler McVicker and Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley). The latter also <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141425801822419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that two VR headset models, Deckard DV1 and Deckard DV2, have appeared in the latest SteamVR beta update. According to Valve's nomenclature, DV units are supposedly the final stage of in-development hardware before retail units, which are labeled 'PV'.</p>



<p>This suggests two headsets could be coming instead of just one, or at least two SKUs. Either way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous rumor</a> that Valve's second Virtual Reality headset, Deckard, would launch in late 2025 seems much more likely now. That rumor pointed to a $1200 price tag, which remains unconfirmed by other leakers at this time.</p>



<p>Deckard will be Valve's second attempt with Virtual Reality following the Index, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in June 2019 at $999</a>. The Index also got a so-called killer application: its purchase came with a free copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-release-date-valve-index-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, the first new installment (albeit technically a prequel) in the series in a long time. Half-Life: Alyx was long considered the gold standard when it comes to triple-A Virtual Reality games, but even that was not enough to really sell consumers on the Index. As of January 2025, only 13.2% of the VR headsets connected to the Steam platform were Index devices, as revealed by the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey.</p>



<p>Has Valve prepared another new game to try and boost the sales of its upcoming Deckard VR headset? Either way, we should know soon. Brad Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141799560200611">seems to think</a> an official announcement could come either this month or the next one. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few (fewer than ten, at this time) former ZeniMax Online developers who worked <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the cancelled game Project Blackbird</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online have just announced <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a>. This new Baltimore-based indie developer was inspired by the cancellation of Project Blackbird to build a studio that avoids the pitfalls experienced across the industry.</p>



<p>Lee Ridout, Chief Executive Officer at Sackbird Studios, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people. When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.</em></p>



<p>David Worley, Chief Operating Officer at Sackbird Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets. We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.</em></p>



<p>Sackbird Studios has already started working on an original project for PC and consoles, though, of course, this is way too early to discuss it. The only hint was shared on LinkedIn, where the studio suggested that its mandate is to 'create unforgettable multiplayer experiences that surprise and thrill players'.</p>



<p>Still, we'll monitor the studio's progress over the years. Stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is PowerWash Simulator 2 Splitscreen? Local Multiplayer Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained.1320430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original PowerWash Simulator game was highly enjoyed by many, but will PowerWash Simulator 2 add splitscreen functionality?</p>



<p>There are many reasons to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look forward to the sequel</a> if you loved the first game, but it’s always nice to see how games like this improve over what came before.</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen or not, and a general look at how multiplayer works.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-splitscreen">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Splitscreen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A friend could help you get this clean faster. Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen functionality. You and one other person can play the game from the same screen as you work together to clean up various levels.</strong></p>



<p>This is actually a pretty big development, considering that the original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator game</a> did not have any local multiplayer, only online.</p>



<p>Often these days, video games are going out of their way to remove local multiplayer opportunities. In some cases, this comes down to the performance taking a noticeable dip when the game tries to run two instances at the same time. Hopefully, the splitscreen in PowerWash Simulator 2 isn’t anything that will cause massive frame drops or other issues.</p>



<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 adding dedicated local multiplayer support may actually be one of the reasons that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game isn’t on older hardware</a>. There’s a possibility that the development team was so focused on making sure the splitscreen experience was as smooth as possible that they wanted to make sure only the current generation consoles could run it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-powerwash-simulator-2">How Many People Can Play PowerWash Simulator 2?</h2>



<p><strong>While two people can play PowerWash Simulator 2 in splitscreen, the career mode has been expanded to four players at a time, with free play holding up to six players at once.</strong></p>



<p>These are some pretty notable increases over the original game. The first game only allowed two people to play the career mode together, and in that, only the host was able to save their progress and got a much better reward payout than the joined friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this time around, all players who join career mode will share all of the progress updates as the host, which allows them to bring their upgrades and unlocked levels into their own save.</p>



<p>Futurlab has definitely taken a big interest in making sure that multiplayer in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> has been improved over the original game. Changes like these are much more friendly to players who want to enjoy the game with others and make it so no one is being left behind just for the “crime” of helping their friend.</p>



<hr>



<p>How many people are you going to play PowerWash Simulator 2 with? Do you plan on doing the career mode with a dedicated splitscreen partner? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Wario, Bubsy and Fatal Fury Special!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest batch of Switch Online SNES games has dropped, and for October three games have been added.</p>
<p>Following his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Purrfect Collection</a> release in September, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_in_claws_encounters_of_the_furred_kind">Bubsy</a> is now back with Accolade's original 1993 Super Nintendo side-scroller. Along with this, we've got the release of the 1994/95 SNK fighting game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a>. It follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_2">Fatal Fury 2</a> on the service in January.</p>
<p>And last but not least is Game Freak's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_and_wario">Mario &amp; Wario</a>. This puzzle-platform title by the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a></strong> developer made its debut on the Super Famicom in 1993, and this marks the first time it's been made available outside of Japan. One catch is, you'll need to use your Joy-Con 2 to play this game (or a USB mouse on the Switch).</p>
<p>Here's the official Nintendo description for each game, along with some screenshots <em>[Update: Feel free to rate each game in our polls, too!]</em>:</p>
<h3><strong>Mario &amp; Wario</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Action puzzles abound in this title released only in Japan for the Super Famicom™ system in 1993. Wario has dropped a bucket on poor Mario's head, and now he can't see! So it's up to you to lead Mario safely to Luigi. Use the forest fairy's magic wand to create platforms, change the direction Mario walks, and defeat enemies. You can clear a total of 100 screens full of unique challenges using simple controls—just move the mouse to move the fairy and click the left button once to perform actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>BUBSY™ in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bubsy the bobcat is on the prowl to recover his stolen yarn! Play as the furr-ocious feline himself in this action title released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System™ in 1993. Bubsy's grand adventure begins when his precious yarn is stolen by a race of yarn-obsessed aliens, the Woolies. Gallivant across 16 total stages, each containing an average of 300 screens, packed with wacky enemies and kooky mechanics. Dash through every nook and cranny of these vast stages as you search for yarn balls scattered throughout and make for the goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>FATAL FURY SPECIAL</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pit 15 different fighters against each other! This fighting game, released for the Super NES™ console in 1995, includes the original eight characters from FATAL FURY 2, as well as three new characters (Billy Kane, Axel Hawk, and Laurence Blood) and a new boss (Wolfgang Krauser). Additionally, three characters from the original FATAL FURY (Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, and Geese Howard) have returned to the fight. By building on the appeal from the previous game with its two-line battles, special moves, and powerful finishers, on top of further improving the series's formula, this game is truly worthy of the title "SPECIAL." And if you can meet certain special conditions, Ryo Sakazaki from the ART OF FIGHTING series will make a special guest appearance, which is noteworthy in itself!</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The same three titles have also been released on the Super Famicom - Nintendo Classics service in Japan this month. Mouse support for the SNES digital collection arrived alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> release in July. Nintendo has added this control option for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-four-more-titles">other games on the service</a> as well.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella, Nintendo's new hybrid device sold 2.4 million units over its first three months on the market (from June to August), placing the system five percent ahead of the PlayStation 4's previous "record-setting pace", which shifted 2.2 million units within the same time frame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With 2.4M units sold LTD over its first 3 months market, Nintendo Switch 2 is now 5% ahead of the previous record setting pace of PlayStation 4, which sold 2.2M units during the 3 months ending January 2014."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4thgwmz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Piscatella further notes how these sales were able to offset "double-digit percentage declines" across the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch. It doesn't stop there, either – with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-sales-in-the-us-are-outpacing-the-original-console-by-75percent">Switch 2's unit sales trending</a> ahead of "time-aligned sales" of Nintendo's original hybrid unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 unit sales are trending 77% ahead the time-aligned sales of the original Nintendo Switch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's financial results in August previously confirmed Switch 2 hardware sales had exceeded <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">"6 million units globally"</a> in the seven weeks after launch. It also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">shared a regional breakdown</a> of Switch 2 hardware sales for this period.</p>
<p>As for the best-selling games in the US in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> made the top 10, coming in at seventh place (down from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/donkey-kong-bananza-is-selling-like-bananas-on-switch-2-us">third spot in the previous month</a>). Although this placement does not factor in the game's digital sales.</p>

The 27-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor that a couple of <em>Verge </em>staffers have tested is <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-27-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw2725q/apd/210-brfr/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored">$699.99</a> right now, which is $200 off its original $899.99 price. It has sold at a similar price before, but discounts have been infrequent these past several months.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzE4MTI2"><p><span>$<!-- -->700</span></p><div><p>Alienware’s AW2725Q is a 26.7-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate, .03ms of latency, two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, and support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.</p></div></div><p>I love this monitor (I published a review earlier this year at <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/531783/alienware-qd-oled-monitor-27-4k-aw2725q-specs-impressions-buy/">Polygon</a></em>). My colleague Nathan Edwards digs it, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/784323/upgrading-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor">posting recently</a> about how making the jump to a high-refresh-rate 240Hz OLED can truly spoil you. I can attest to this; it was a little heartbreaking to go back to my 1080p IPS panels after returning the AW2725Q to Alienware.</p><p>This Alienware monitor made waves in early 2025 by proving that companies could deliver a 4K OLED for under $1,000. It wasn’t all that long ago that 1440p was the standard at that price. Whether you actually have a PC that can play games in 4K at respectable frame rates or not, it’s good to have a monitor that’s ready to play high-resolution content for when you upgrade your PC. Also, you can connect a console like a PS5, Xbox Series X, or a Nintendo Switch 2 to play titles at up to 4K at 120Hz, and they’ll look great on the AW2725Q’s 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/796918/amazon-october-prime-day-alienware-aw2725q-oled-gaming-monitor-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

Many are mourning the loss of a game that would have been very <em>of this moment</em>, and given millions of people the chance to sneak around and then brutally murder some racists. And I can see this timeline, shimmering mirage-like in the distance, where the company behind a series centred on an Arab character in a post-9/11 world and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Freedom_Cry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a whole expansion based on a freed slave</a> would have done that time and those events some small amount of justice.</p><p>I am not one of those people, because it is 2025, and this is a different time and a very different company.

After everything that happened trying to sell a game where you<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> play as a woman and a black guy in Japan</a>, can you imagine how Ubisoft leadership would handle the management and messaging for a game where a black Assassin roamed the South shanking Klansmen?</p><p>As cool as the pitch is, I'm not surprised at news like this. I'm surprised it got far enough off the drawing board at today's Ubisoft to be able to be cancelled in the first place.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-reconstruction-era-klansmen-cancelled-kkk]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Would you believe us if we told you that the best Prime Big Deal Days gaming controller deals aren't actually at Amazon? Well, it's true--Walmart is running its own sale this week, and the deals include muiltiple bundles that include a PS5 DualSense or Xbox Wireless controller plus a game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Discord has denied that the party responsible for the recent security breach against the company has the data it claims to have. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, the group claiming responsibility for the hack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-hackers-claim-to-have-1-5tb-of-age-verification-photos/">said that it had gained access</a> to over 1.5TB of data, including over 2 million age-verification photos. In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, Discord said that not only is the number not true, but it’s not even close. </p>



<p>Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler&nbsp;tells Insider Gaming that it has identified around 70,000 users “that may have had government ID photos exposed.” The public claims by the group, they say, are all being done as a means to extort the company.</p>



<p>The full statement from Discord is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Following&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last week’s announcement</a>&nbsp;about a security incident involving a third-party customer service provider, we want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online.&nbsp;First, as stated in our blog post, this was&nbsp;not&nbsp;a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review&nbsp;<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041820932-Help-I-m-old-enough-to-use-Discord-in-my-country-but-I-got-locked-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">age-related appeals</a>. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts. We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The incident that involved lost data took place in late September and was addressed on October 3 by the company. At the time, the company said that information such as Discord usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and “limited” billing information was compromised. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2017's indie 3D platformer&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/yooka-laylee-review-flying-lizard-monster" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Laylee</a>&nbsp;</em>from Playtonic Games, a studio founded by former Rare staffers, was aiming to catch "lightning in a bottle" with the release, which was positioned to be <em>Banjo-Kazooie's</em> spiritual successor. While the game received mixed responses following its release and a spin-off game, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yooka-laylee-and-impossible-lair-out-this-october" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>,</em> launched some time later, there were calls for another adventure with Yooka and Laylee, and after eight years, Playtonic returns with <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yooka-replaylee-release-date" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Replaylee</a>.</em></p>

<p>Quite simply, it's "better late than never," as nearly a decade later, with <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> becoming a cult favorite among platformer enthusiasts and eventually the broad gaming community, the time felt perfect for these tandem adventurers to reemerge once again.</p>

<p>This time around, Playtonic paid attention to the players and the community with a thoughtful remaster of the 2017 release to include new content and optimizations for modern consoles, resulting in the epic grand return of Yooka and Laylee.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-640.jpg?itok=okPqrvzB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-640.jpg?itok=3oH6pBmS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh no, poor One Book! Quick, help them! (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> Review: The Epic Grand Return</h2>

<p>Much like the original 2017 indie platformer release,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, the game's remaster sees our heroes briefly recounting their past adventures aboard "The Batship Crazy" in epic fairytale style&nbsp;before their fleet got beached due to an incoming storm. Nevertheless, this mishap didn't deter the duo, as after landing safely and repairing their ship, they traversed their new location and encountered a caged magical book, the One Book.</p>

<p>While their deeds were truly appreciated, this event annoyed&nbsp;the nefarious&nbsp;CEO Capital B (who looks like Gru from&nbsp;<em>Despicable Me</em>) and his underappreciated yet equally villainous cohort, Dr. Quack, back at the Hivory Towers. Distraught at the disappearance of the One Book, Dr. Quack switched to Plan B to recapture the book; however, while vacuuming all the books, several pages or Pagies of the One Book gets ripped from its spine, thus getting scattered across the world levels. It's up to Yooka and Laylee to collect the Pagies to reassemble the One Book before Capital B and Dr. Quack.</p>

<p>And this is where the journey for the adventurous duo begins, as they must collect the Pagies across world levels or Grand Tomes while acquiring their first in-game currency of gold coins called Q.U.I.D.S,&nbsp;Quills, and puzzle pieces along their journey. But they won't be alone, as a few familiar faces will aid them with unique upgrades called Tonics, some snazzy customization pieces, clues, and a spade-donning knight who seemingly found themselves lost but comes to Yooka and Laylee to call for help in taking down&nbsp;Capital B and&nbsp;Dr. Quack for good this time around.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review:&nbsp;An Absolute Page Turner</h2>

<p>Playtonic Games has listened to player feedback and delivered what could possibly be the best <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> game we needed by overhauling everything that first appeared in the original release, including the world design, gameplay mechanics, puzzles, challenges, audio, and visuals.</p>

<p>While these mass changes from top to bottom make <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> vastly different from the&nbsp;2017 release, much of the story, hilarious jokes, and puns are still the same, retaining that nostalgic feeling we first experienced in <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-642.jpg?itok=AmOtCOf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-642.jpg?itok=0dDjjcc_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get to revist key Grand Tome locations, including Moodymaze Marsh, all revamped and reimagined for Yooka-Replaylee. (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of the game's story, after Yooka and Laylee free the One Book before the book got vacuumed, Yooka and Laylee must explore several Grand Tomes by jumping into large storybooks and exploring these areas to find Pagies, Quills, puzzle pieces, and&nbsp;Q.U.I.D.S before moving to the next world level. As previously mentioned, the story and narrative beats are still the heartbeat of <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, by introducing slight changes to the story's presentation and pacing, leaving room for the developers to showcase their comedic writing.</p>

<p>In the words of the salesman Trowsers, "thank goodnessss," because while the devs can truly let their writing take centerstage, the execution in how the narrative beats, jokes, and puns were delivered was outstanding, as one can feel the writing team has more confidence and pride in their work. This also gives Yooka and Laylee, as well as the supporting characters, so much more personality and wit, while much of the fluff and annoying dialogue has been scrubbed away, allowing one to truly appreciate the remaster's story and the cast of characters.</p>

<p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> is still very much a 3D platformer collect-a-thon game, which players will spend much of their time collecting Pagies to unlock doors within the Hivory Towers and locate other Grand Tomes. Quills and Q.U.I.D.S serve as the in-game currencies for Yooka and Laylee to spend on various items and upgrades. Players assume control of this tandem as they explore multiple world levels, utilizing various abilities already accessible at the start of the game, with tighter gameplay controls that make traversal and platforming smoother and more rewarding.</p>

<p>There were times when the controls failed us, mostly when platforming, but this was largely attributed to the camera angles guiding us off the platform or not being able to use specific abilities like the Sonar Shot and Sonar 'Splosion to hit invisible targets effectively. What was a blessing was the ability to use rolling to knock down enemies, move up slippery surfaces, destroy crates, or evade danger swiftly, which players can now roll infinitely and mind their business without consuming energy.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review:&nbsp;Sssay It Ain't Ssso</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-643.jpg?itok=SR_MkYk9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-643.jpg?itok=ywUD-nDd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having a map really comes in handy as it helps players track all challenges, fast travel, and Pagie locations.&nbsp;(Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>As each world level has been massively revamped to accompany the overhaul of gameplay mechanics, the world levels are now significantly larger for players to explore, featuring overworlds, cavern systems, and underworld areas, as well as a World Map to refer to and check which areas haven't been explored or Pagies haven't been collected.</p>

<p>Traversal feels more fun and exciting with the fast-travel system, as players can locate and activate bookmarks called Mark to warp to specific areas to revisit challenges or farm more Q.U.I.D.S., so players' time isn't wasted by dashing from one corner of the map to the next.</p>

<p>Gameplay progression has also been reworked for <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> as players are now geared to collecting a specific number of Pagies needed to unlock new areas within the Hivory Towers to access Grand Tomes. While the previous level progression system, which was controversial at the time, has been done away with in <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, the removal of this system does lead to unusual difficulty spikes in the remaster, which caught us off guard at times.</p>

<p>Given the brilliance with which Playtonic has remastered&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em> for modern hardware, there are a few minor bugs that we're sure Yooka will gobble up in no time. Sure, some of the challenges in&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>&nbsp;have upped the difficulty, which will require players to "lock in" (certainly one did even after multiple failed attempts), players may encounter a few visual and latency issues on PC for the time being, but it's not too bothersome.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-641.jpg?itok=5mNU8PVi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-641.jpg?itok=WnydVLQ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> does have its shortcomings; however, the new changes and improvements certainly makes it stand out from its original release. (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, fans of this iconic duo will certainly not be disappointed with this outstanding and "definitive remastered and enhanced version" of <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>. Boasting a revamp of the classic 3D platformer, which sees multiple Grand Tomes and their worlds reimagined with new challenges, more Pagies to collect, familiar faces to aid Yooka and Laylee and assist in navigating the terrains, and so much additional content to keep players coming back to test their platforming skills.</p>

<p>Likewise, some of Yooka and Laylee's moveset and team combos have been reworked and are much easier to acquire by visiting the various vendors found within these worlds, and they can bag themselves some new threads to don and show off their fashionista sides. And let's not forget that the devs retained the game's sense of humor, as the jokes and puns have been one-upped, which had left one giggling long after they were mentioned.</p>

<p>Mind you, the game does have a few optimization errors, such as cutscenes and entering new Grand Tomes having slight latency bugs momentarily, but they didn't affect the overall gameplay experience. Additionally, the issues with the level progression system have left the game riddled with random difficulty spikes that will cause some frustration when exploring each world level, while leaving these levels with no structured design, but it didn't deter us from having an incredible, nostalgic trip down memory lane.</p>

You could not pay me to go to the moon, I think. I'm glad Mr. Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear had a good time up there, but that place is scary! It's just a massive, dark rock! But in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-moon">Dark Moon</a>, an upcoming survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game that just got a release date, that darkness is your friend, because if you want to survive on the moon, you've got to protect yourself from that hot, hot orb in the sky called the sun.
</p>
<p>
In Dark Moon, your goal is simple: stay the hell out of the sun's path. This is a world where the sun's rays will burn you to a crisp, so you need to constantly be moving to make sure you're on the dark side of the moon (the scariest side and potential all-time best cover art for an album ever). So the story goes, you are a member of the Engineering Council, tasked with managing the construction of a mining system on the moon that gets all donked up after a solar storm hits the Earth, destroying all electronics, and leaving you without any form of communication.

<p>
To get around the moon, you have a big ole spider-like vehicle called the Mechaplex, which serves as your main base of operations. Each playthrough is supposedly non-linear; as you make your way across the moon, you might come across survivors that want to join you (who may not have your best interests at heart), or you might need to gather up minerals to better survive.
</p><p>
You can build upon the Mechaplex too, netting your crew better abilities, or making easier and faster ways to get around. Occasionally you may have to make difficult choices related to said crew, the members of which may react positively or negatively depending on who you let onto the Mechaplex, and who you leave behind. Slightly nightmarish scenario to be honest! Better that it's a video game and not my lived experience.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's coming October 29th, so it's only a few weeks away now. Seems seasonally appropriate, even if I don't know I can handle it due to existential dread reasons. Might be worth adding to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1105330/Dark_Moon/">wishlist on Steam</a> if it tickles your fancy, though.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Skateboarding games are a hell of a good time and EA’s recent <i>skate</i>, the free-to-play title aiming to reboot EA’s once-cherished series, is trying to lure folks back into the thrills of digital ollies and kickflips. And because it’s a free-to-play game from a AAA publisher in 2025, it’s got microtransactions and seasons and all that stuff. While we mostly tolerate this silliness in games nowadays, some stuff is just too expensive and too ugly to pass without comment.</p> <p>Instead of throwing money at the screen for a skin of space zombie-stomper Isaac Clarke from <i>Dead Space</i>, fans of <i>skate</i> have taken to the internet to throw shade at the developers for selling such an ugly version of Clarke for $35 bucks (h/t <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-fans-slam-35-isaac-clarke-costume-in-eas-new-skate/1100-6535310/">comrade Pitts at <i>GameSpot</i></a>). That’s like, a whole meal at Taco Bell these days (with maybe a drink if you’re lucky). It’s also the price of many full, complete games you can play from start to finish. That’s probably what’s left folks so sore: <i>skate</i>. Is the type of game you could once plunk down a moderate sum for and be done with it, but is now yet another nagging wallet leech trying to bank on your nostalgia.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can buy 3 Dead Sapce games with that money  (and probably 3 Skate games)</p> <p>— Diogo Rodrigues (@Rodrigues_520) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The situation reminds us just how far we’ve come from an era of gaming that felt more respectful of our time and money. One fan over on r/SkateEA points out that 2010’s <i>Skate 3</i> had an Isaac Clarke skin–but it was free and seemed more faithful to the character’s appearance in the original game.</p>

    <p>It’s a real shame as <i>skate</i> looks like a good time otherwise, full of all of the crazy stuff we’ll never be able to do in real life on a skateboard.</p>   <p>And as another fan on Reddit opines, the game’s battle pass (skate pass?) just contains “ugly accessories and clothing along with phoned in feeling graphics for decks” instead of stuff from actual skate brands. And if ever there was an industry that was ripe for having its aesthetics&nbsp; cut up and sold in little bits, it’s the skateboard industry. With its various legendary designs, from the <a href="https://www.birdhouseskateboards.com/">epic birds of Birdhouse Skateboards</a> to the gorgeous artwork found on your average <a href="https://www.elementbrand.lu/skateboards/">Element board</a> (which used to my brand of choice back in the day), there’s a ton of cool designs that could be packaged into the game as a fitting tribute to the industry. I’d still be annoyed if those cost $35 a piece, but at least they’d feel a little more relevant.</p>  <p>C’mon, EA.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Doja Cat is coming to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536">Fortnite’s 2025 Halloween event</a> and the battle royale tried to get players hyped by letting R&amp;B’s “Queen of Memes” take over the <em>Fortnite</em> X account on Wednesday. It didn’t take long for that piece of online performance art to blow up after the account tweeted what seemed like an obvious allusion to sex toys and Doja Cat denied being behind it. “Shit cringe as fuck now I’m embarrassed,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The<em> Fortnite</em> X account had Doja Cat’s in-game face as its avatar when it posted “mother of rose toys,” which many fans immediately took to mean sex toys. “Oh damn the sex update is real!!” one joked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1o1jdub/mother_of_rose_toys/">on the subreddit</a>. But Doja Cat immediately distanced herself from the whole thing and the post was taken down. People didn’t believe her at first. “I told them not to man that’s not even me,” she wrote. “I said this yesterday and then said ‘don’t post that’ :/.”</p> <p> <figure id="attachment_2000633342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633342">X</figcaption></figure> </p> <p>The internet-savvy artist has a history of trolling and back-handed marketing endorsements, as <a href="http://he internet-savvy artist known for trolling"><em>Polygon</em> points out</a>. So many are left wondering whether this was an actual brand activation gone bad or part of some elaborate 4D poster chess to get people talking and arguing about what is, at the end of the day, a microtransaction-filled in-game event aimed at getting players to empty their virtual wallets on overpriced skins. Is the modern media landscape so cynical as to desperately gin up a non-troversy just to pad the quarterly sales figures?</p> <p>Some folks are genuinely surprised that a game largely aimed at children would go anywhere near sexual entendres, even if the whole thing really is just a social media fake-out on page seven of the <em>Fortnite</em> Halloween 2025 marketing deck. With the culture already primed to lash out at any online gaming-adjacent micro-scandal, it does seem a bit far-fetched that Epic Games would willingly ignite a whole discourse cycle around “<em>Fortnite</em> sex toys.”</p> <p>After all, it only just got done making sure there weren’t any accidental Nazi allusions in its latest <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-s2-fortnite-dance-nazi-swastika-refund-2000630714"><em>Peacemaker</em> emote</a> following some late season-2 twists. It’s due back tomorrow with a “modified” animation that will apparently remove any possibility of it accidentally conjuring a swastika. Then again, Epic didn’t seem too worried about Darth Vader, voiced by AI James Earl Jones, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-star-wars-ai-darth-vader-james-earl-jones-1851781018">saying racist stuff and cursing at players,</a> so who can say?</p>

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Americans are spending more on game consoles in 2025, compared to August of last year, and that’s mostly thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 and tariffs. Hardware sales topped $312 million in the US in August, up 32 percent from $236 million in August of 2024, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op74cc4s26">according to Circana</a>. That’s a huge increase, especially considering that sales of the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and original Switch all fell by double-digit percentage points year over year.</p><p>A big driver is the Switch 2, which has sold over 2.4 million units in the US during its first three months, making it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest selling console</a> of all time. It’s outpacing the PlayStation 4 (the previous record holder) by a full five percent after the three month mark. And compared to the original Switch, the Switch 2 is absolutely crushing — outpacing its predecessor by 77 percent at this stage of its lifecycle.</p><p>Consumer spending on game consoles in the US is up to $2.9 billion for the year, 20 percent higher than last year. But while the number of consoles sold is up 6.5 percent year-over-year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">prices are up 12.3 percent</a>, accounting for most of the increase in spending. A 512GB Xbox Series S started the year at $299.99, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">is now $399.99</a>. The all-digital Series X started at $449.99, and is now all the way up to $599.99. Similarly all PlayStation 5 models have seen a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">$50 price bump</a>.</p><p>Despite the soaring prices, consumers haven’t been scared off yet. But, while $799.99 for a tricked out 2TB Xbox Series X in Galaxy Black is hard to swallow, we haven’t quite reached <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/7/17830868/neo-geo-mini-review-arcade-imperfect">Neo Geo prices</a> yet. That handheld debuted at $649.99 in 1990 — or about $1,500 in today’s money.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-lawsuit-island-creator-bots-2000633343</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms">Tim Sweeney</a>, CEO of Epic Games, thinks that automated chatbots can be used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-boss-makes-a-bold-claim-about-ai-in-video-games/1100-6532073/">enrich games with auto-generated dialogue</a>. But what he and his company don’t like, however, is the end user using bots to bring false life to lifeless server rooms so that user-created maps can earn money even if nobody’s actually playing them.</p> <p>Two Michigan-based <i>Fortnite</i> creators, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, are at the center of a lawsuit filed by Epic Games that alleges they created 20,000 bots to falsely inflate the popularity of their maps (h/t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-fortnite-creative-bot-lawsuit-uefn-idris-nahdi-ayob-nasser/">comrade Hernandez at <i>Polygon</i></a>). And they weren’t just doing it because they were lonely and wanted thousands of bot friends. Generating engagement on <i>Fortnite </i>maps is akin to printing money, as <i>Fortnite</i>’s “Island Creator” program sees folks earn real cash for making genuinely cool stuff that appeals to genuine people. Create a cool island that attracts loads of players, and Epic will make it worth your while.</p>

 <p>But alas, we live in a society with “rules.” And one of <i>Fortnite</i>’s creator program rules is that engagement is measured by real people playing the game. This is in addition to some pretty <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-uefn-call-of-duty-dmca-creator-copyright-1850299456">strict rules about intellectual property</a>.</p> <p>Epic Games alleges that the defendants were intentionally trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DAltzrgrMn8">circumvent</a> the program’s terms of service, having bots flood their islands “using a cloud gaming service that allows users to play video games, like <i>Fortnite</i>, remotely.”</p>

 <p>If true, it’s a computer abuse scheme that went on to earn the defendants tens of thousands of dollars. But Epic eventually caught on, cut them off and ordered the duo to stop playing the game and “destroy all copies of <i>Fortnite</i>” they currently had. The two apparently didn’t listen and continued playing <i>Fortnite</i>, and so now Epic is escalating things, alleging that:</p>

 <p>Defendants’ conduct undermines Epic’s relationship with developers,…depriving legitimate developers of the full share of funds they otherwise would have received and eroding the trust Epic has built with them.</p> <p>Epic Games is seeking financial recuperation, but also wants to ban not only these players but also their entire bloodlines from ever playing <i>Fortnite</i> again. No, I’m not being snarky and for once in my life it seems that I don’t need to be: The lawsuit literally wants to ban Nahdi and Ayob Nasser and their “heirs [and] successors” from playing <i>Fortnite</i>.</p> <p>Rational behavior from rational people.</p>
