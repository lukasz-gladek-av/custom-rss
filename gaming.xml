            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG landing not only on Switch but also on other platforms in May.</p>

<p>That's right: after numerous delays,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>finally has a concrete release date, and it's May 21st. Not only that, but the game will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox as well as Switch.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during a February <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, at which point it was given a release window of 2023. That release window later proved to be overly optimistic, though, as in November of that year, Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed the game to 2024</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=64Wg7ErB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=kKa7QJEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, a release date of October 10th was settled on for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, but it was then announced that the game wouldn't make that date either, with Level-5 delaying its "slow life" RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">indefinitely in August last year</a>.</p>

<p>Now, however, Level-5 has announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, and it looks like the studio is serious about this one, although there's every chance it'll be delayed again before May 21st rolls around.</p>

<p>The release date was revealed as part of a brand new features trailer for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, showing off the things you can do in the game. If you're a fan of the original 3DS&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, then it's likely you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>

<p>Not only can you adventure across a "vast open world" and choose which one of a variety of jobs you want to pursue, but you can also create and maintain your own island, delve into "endless dungeons", and even play the game in split-screen co-op.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013482/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st (assuming it doesn't get delayed again). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-pledges-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-tough-third-quarter.1109580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it plans to implement yet more cost-cutting measures into the next financial year in order to exceed its cost reduction targets "by a significant margin".</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers the period between October and December 2024), Ubisoft reveals that its "net bookings" - essentially net sales sans fees and other cancellations - fell by 34.8% when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>The company points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">cancellation of first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and the closure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three</a> Ubisoft locations as major cost reduction initiatives, and CEO Yves Guillemot says Ubisoft isn't done yet, although he doesn't clarify exactly what's coming next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=6spiOGKj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=bhcu7Nf7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft canned first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in December.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot says that Ubisoft "plan[s] to pursue [its] efforts" with regards to cost-cutting measures into the 2025-26 financial year, "going beyond the initial target by a significant margin".</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what he means by that, but given that previous cost-cutting measures have involved layoffs and studio closures, it's not unlikely that we'll see more of that kind of thing in the year to come.</p>

<p>He also says that the "formal review process of [Ubisoft's] strategic options" is ongoing, with a view to "unlock[ing] the best value from our assets for our stakeholders" and fostering the "best conditions to create great games in a fast-evolving market".</p>

<p>For context, a Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company back in September, reportedly prompting Guillemot and major stakeholder Tencent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">consider taking the company private</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=We_M_-tE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=y0jZGoJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is probably banking on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to do well.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Ubisoft's future, Guillemot says the company is "fully focused on the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">on March 20th</a>", echoing the studio's comment when approached about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">rumors of Saudi-funded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, during a followup Q&amp;A session, Guillemot told investors that Ubisoft is committed to "open-world action adventure" games and "game as a service-native experiences" for the foreseeable future, so if you were hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>sequel, you may well be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>My <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">first time playing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, I was stressed the hell out. My team and I were in an underground dungeon, trying to make our way past traps and dangerous blind corners, all while knowing there was an invisible clock ominously ticking down above our heads. If we were still underground when it hit zero a deadly storm called Night’s Tide would close in, potentially trapping us. That kind of anxiety was exactly what <em>Elden Ring</em> combat designer and <em>Nightreign</em>’s game director Junya Ishizaki had in mind.</p><p>Speaking with Ishizaki after my time with the game, I was surprised to learn one of the main inspirations for <em>Nightreign</em> – a co-op focused PvE action game – was the board game <em>Pandemic</em>. Ishizaki said that one of the things he enjoyed about <em>Pandemic</em>, which he later incorporated into <em>Nightreign</em>, was the idea of playing under pressure. “When you come up against these seemingly insurmountable odds, it’s up to the player to choose how to use their time in order to overcome the seemingly impossible challenge,” he explained.</p><p>The tension between whether to continue through the dungeon as the HP-draining Night’s Tide storm slowly closed in, or to cut bait and run, was one of the most satisfying feelings I had during the hands-on. But I also felt another, far less pleasing type of tension – the one between me and my companions. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to hold my own against bosses or that a decision I made would turn out to be a waste of precious time. Since I play FromSoftware games as a strictly solo enterprise, that anxiety was new to me. But according to Ishizaki, that anxiety is also part of the plan.</p><p>He explained that the development team’s approach to <em>Nightreign</em> was a desire to incorporate elements learned from <em>Elden Ring</em> reconfigured into a new experience. Since FromSoftware is known for games with punishing combat, they focused their ideas on revamping the combat system including tweaking the number of combatants. “One of the ways we could make [combat] really exciting and interesting was having co-op be the main focus, and having players have to work together,” Ishizaki said. </p><p>This approach was interesting because one of the things many people enjoyed about <em>Elden Ring</em> was that it’s a very solitary and lonesome game. It’s also a difficult one. You are subject to violent death over and over and it’s powerfully satisfying when you’re able to take what you learned from those deaths to beat a tough encounter. But the goal of <em>Nightreign</em> isn’t to replicate the experience of <em>Elden Ring</em> with a multiplayer modifier: it’s to make something fundamentally new.</p><p>“We wanted to break from this feeling of loneliness and isolation and overcoming things on your own.” Ishizaki said. Since the team wanted to make <em>Nightreign</em> feel fresh and exciting that meant doing away with the creature comforts players expect from <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p><p>“Part of that means working together,” he said. So while my two favorite aspects of <em>Elden Ring</em> are totally absent in <em>Nightreign</em>, I don’t feel alienated by the game. The good internal tension I experience as a solo player is replaced by an external tension – learning to work together in a group – that I could learn to love once I get my hands on the full game.</p><p>But Ishizaki understands that there still might be other players who look at <em>Nightreign</em> and can’t get past the game’s frenetic multiplayer focus. “Existing fans may seem quite bewildered at first when it comes to <em>Nightreign</em>,” he said. “But we feel like once players get it in their hands and actually start playing, it’s actually not too big of a hurdle to overcome.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s not surprising that he was able to help bring this new <em>D&amp;D</em> series to Netflix considering his past work with the company.

		<p>Sometimes, a game can live rent-free in your head, despite never having played it. That’s been “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/is-this-seat-taken-is-a-polite-and-cosy-puzzler-where-you-have-to-consider-other-peoples-feelings/">Is This Seat Taken?</a>” for me. Announced just a couple short weeks ago, I’ve watched the trailer a bunch of times, forced other people to watch it a bunch of times, and even taken it upon myself to force my phone on acquaintances to watch it a bunch more. So, it might have caught my attention. Is This Seat Taken? is a puzzler built around the idea that people don’t like sitting next to most other people. You have to balance the needs of everyone, despite the fact that they smell, they’re messy, and hell, they might pull their phone out and make you watch random game trailers. The monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Nw0qzomec?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each level of Is This Seat Taken? presents you with a setting, and then a batch of people you need to place within it. The first level is a taxi, getting you used to dragging and dropping your little folks onto the available seats, while their desire card pops up at the bottom of the screen.</p>


<p>Things start out simple enough – Jordi wants a window seat, when there’s two available, and Aurora prefers to sit alone, so she can sit on the other end of the row. They’re both very reasonable about it too, and there’s no pushing or shoving which tells you this must be a fantasy world.</p>


<p>Then you find yourself dealing with a limousine. Suddenly, there’s five people to deal with, the seats all face different directions, and each person has two needs rather than one. After various roles in hospitality, I’m all about making customers happy, but I’m already sweating the details. Given that you’re essentially doing this for reviews or likes – a thumbs up shows you’ve picked a good seat – I’m now beginning to worry about being reviewed on SeatAdvisor. This isn’t supposed to be stressful is it?</p>
<p>Juggling the different needs of each person becomes increasingly tricky, and through the demo you find the numbers of people you’re dealing with steadily increase. A bus journey proves really interesting, with people getting on and off, and a bunch of new needs like wanting to sleep or – the horror – wanting to play loud music. I mean, there should be an option to forcibly eject those people at the bus stop, but anyway.</p>
<p>There’s little snippets of storyline woven into some of the scenes, with indie movie director Alexis helping their actor friend Nat to feel at ease, while we learn all about Hat Wars fandom, where the movies are great but the fans are awful. It seems as though Is This Seat Taken? has an awful lot to say about the world, despite being a game about little shape people being polite and sitting in the right seats. It’s a great combination.</p>

<p>Despite the complicated human interactions, Is this seat taken? is a joyful and upbeat game. The laidback tunes help to ease the trickier puzzle moments, and you’re helped along the way by the changing expressions of each sitter, telling you whether they’re content or not.</p>
<p>You can check out Is This Seat Taken for yourself right now, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">demo available to download on Steam</a>, ahead of its release on PC and mobile later this year.</p>

<p>After hearing Take-Two CEO’s recent comments on supporting “legacy titles”, GTA Online may have a chance at survival even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s CEO, was recently asked why players should keep investing in GTA Online in 2025 when an improved and enhanced version could arrive with GTA 6. Zelnick didn’t mention GTA Online or an online version of GTA 6 specifically; however, his answer provides some hope to the massive community.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Zelnick stated that his statements are theoretic, as he can’t mention a particular project (GTA 6 Online) “when an announcement hasn’t been made.” However, he added that Take-Two is known for its support properties if the community is still involved with the games.</p><p>&nbsp;As an example, he explained that 2K released NBA 2K Online in China in 2012, and soon after, a new version called NBA 2K Online 2 was released in China in 2017. However, even after the latest version arrived, the company didn’t sunset the first online game, and they are both still available in the market. The CEO concluded, stating, “We’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>GTA Online is one of the most popular multiplayer games, bringing in over 150,000 players daily on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/271590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam alone</a>. The online version of GTA 5 has been available for more than 10 years now, and players have gathered a considerable amount of wealth and assets in the game by investing a lot of time and sometimes a lot of real-world money. Take-Two and Rockstar have earned a lot through GTA Online, and with a community so big, there might be a chance that the game survives even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the GTA 6 publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the game influencing violence in the real world. Also, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not coming to PC at launch</a>. Do you want GTA Online to survive even after GTA 6 releases? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

    <p><span>Rescue lives, unveil the truth behind the catastrophe, and reignite hope with the Coreflame.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne,” will launch on February 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-944235"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Trailblazers and their companions will forge ahead on the grand Flame-Chase Journey, venturing into uncharted territories and embracing a tapestry of thrilling events. Adding brilliance to the adventure are two new playable characters, Tribbie and Mydei, each weaving their unique threads into the ever-unfolding saga.</p><p>In the previous chapter, Nikador’s Coreflame was successfully reclaimed. Yet, the Flame-Chase Journey remains a race against time. With this pivotal milestone achieved, preparations for the next step are already underway. In Version 3.1, the Trailblazer will take on the role of a messenger, embarking alongside their companions to a brand-new map, “Grove of Epiphany,” where the journey continues with renewed purpose.</p><p>The Grove of Epiphany, a revered city-state honoring Cerces, the Reason Titan, stands as Amphoreus’ cradle of knowledge and maintains strong ties with Okhema. Known for its vital academic contributions to the Flame-Chase Journey, the Grove has long provided critical research on the black tide and Titans, serving as a beacon of enlightenment and progress. Cerces, like Kephale, harbors goodwill toward humanity and, with boundless generosity, transformed the Grove into a sanctuary for knowledge seekers, offering rest, study, and the wisdom of the world to mortals once shrouded in ignorance. However, this haven of learning has recently fallen to the black tide’s assault. Amidst the ensuing chaos, a shadowy foe has emerged, seeking to claim Cerces’ Coreflame for their own. In the Version 3.1 Trailblaze Mission, Trailblazers must rise to the challenge, rescuing survivors, uncovering truths about the catastrophe, and reclaiming Cerces’ Coreflame to restore hope to Okhema.</p><p>Moreover, in Version 3.1’s Main Story, Trailblazers will harness the power of Oronyx to awaken echoes of the past, leading them to a new map where the “Abyss of Fate,” once known as “Janusopolis,” stands in its Day State. Along the way, they will uncover long-buried secrets from the “Era Chrysea,” gradually unveiling the mysterious past of Tribbie, the latest 5-star playable character.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

As a 5-star Imaginary character following the Path of Destruction, in battle, Mydei fully utilizes his undying nature to fight the enemies. With a mass of Max HP, he can consume HP to charge, and then enter an enhanced form. When enhanced, Mydei automatically strikes enemies in his turn, dealing greater DMG and showcasing the might of the crown prince in Castrum Kremnos.Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Yunli and Huohuo will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.In addition to new characters and storylines, Version 3.1 brings an array of exciting events. One highlight is the new season of Divergent Universe, which introduces a brand-new research topic centered on Amphoreus. This time, battles will feature the innovative "Day and Night System," where combat alternates between day and night. Each state provides unique boosts, while transitions between them trigger additional effects. Furthermore, the Day and Night System, along with its associated Blessings, is deeply connected to the Titans and the Chrysos Heirs, adding layers of strategy and lore to the experience. Additionally, Trailblazers will take part in The Awooo Firm event, where players step into the role of manager to assist the chimera squad in Okhema. By providing guidance and support, Trailblazers will help the squad turn their fortunes around and rise to become the strongest team of all.<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,864 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

<p>Titled "Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne" in typical grandiose HoYoverse style, Version 3.1 will arrive on February 26th and will bring a brand new map to explore, plus two new 5-star characters to use and more.</p>

<p>First up, Version 3.1 will let you explore the Grove of Epiphany, a city-state under attack by a "shadowy foe" looking to claim its Titan's Coreflame for its own. The Trailblaze Mission for this update will see you investigating what's happening in the Grove and reclaiming the Coreflame.</p>

<p>The first is Tribbie, a transformed version of the demigod Tribbios. HoYoverse says she deliberately split herself into "thousands of Messengers" using the Century Gate, and now, she can join your party.</p>

<p>She can buff your team and debuff enemies to help your party deal more damage, so she's a valuable combatant to have if you need an extra edge in combat.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in Version 3.1 is Mydei, a "warrior as valiant as a lion" who consumes HP to deal extra damage. Reruns for Yunli and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo" rel="nofollow">Huohuo</a> will also appear in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 event cycle.</p>




<p>You can also look forward to a new season of Divergent Universe in which battles will be split between day and night, introducing unique effects for both times of day. That's alongside the usual gameplay fixes and miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.1 launches across all platforms on February 26th.</p>

            <p>Renowned actress Laura Bailey portrayed deuteragonist Abby Anderson in The Last of Us Part 2, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> almost didn't cast her because "she's in everything".</p>
<p>That's coming from The Last of Us creator and Naughty Dog exec Neil Druckmann himself. Druckmann was chatting with Santa Monica Studio's creative director Cory Barlog during a panel at DICE this week, where he said he was "sure it was going to be a different actor" when he was watching the auditions live (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/neil-druckmann-wasnt-going-to-cast-laura-bailey-in-the-last-of-us-part-2-because-shes-in-everything-but-changed-his-mind-after-studying-her-audition-frame-by-frame/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Even the studio more generally thought Bailey wouldn't be right for the role as Abby, as she had already been in so many other games, including Naughty Dog's own Uncharted series.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, and as we all know, the team changed its mind. Druckmann said the tipping point came after studying the audition videos "frame-by-frame", and noticing a moment of "vulnerability" in Bailey's audition that others hadn't shown. Druckmann then showed this moment to the wider Naughty Dog team, convincing them that Bailey was the right choice for Abby.</p>
<p>Bailey went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2020-live-report">win the Best Performance accolade at the 2020 Game Awards for her portrayal of Abby</a>.</p>
<p>For her role, Bailey received inexcusable online abuse, which didn't just threaten her life, but that of her baby son's as well. During a behind-the-scenes documentary about the game last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">Bailey confirmed that the "real hardcore death threats" were so concerning</a>, they were passed on to police.</p>

			<p>Warhorse Studios has <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> the imminent launch of official mod support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The developer also revealed that it will be implemented through Steamworks rather than other options like Mod.io. As such, you should be able to download mods directly through Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>This will, of course, be in addition to all the regular mods that have been released and will continue to be released via platforms like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods?BH=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> some of the convenience mods last week, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-4k-skins-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skin mod</a>, but there's a lot more you can find there. There are 412 Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods on Nexus, 291 of which were released in the last seven days. With the official mod integration, the community will have even greater incentives to continue improving, tweaking, and enhancing the game. Presumably, official mod tools will be released, too, although that was not explicitly confirmed at this point.</p>
<p>Warhorse's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was a resounding success on all accounts. Commercially, it has already recouped costs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold over a million units</a>. Critically, it stands at 88 average score on Metacritic. This includes our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 score from Chris Wray</a>:</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>The release of official mod support won't be the end of Warhorse's work for this game. The Czech studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its 2025 roadmap, announcing a free update for Spring (bringing barber, horse racing, and Hardcore mode), the Brushes With Death DLC for Summer, the Legacy of the Forge DLC for Autumn, and the Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC for Winter.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-and-first-major-update-revealed.1109490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine and publisher Arc Games have revealed the first major Early Access roadmap for action-adventure roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, as well as what's coming as part of the game's first big update next week.</p>

<p>The game launched last month to mixed player reviews on Steam, with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">criticizing performance and accessibility issues</a> as well as some of the game's design.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the first big update in February, which lands on the 18th, aims to address some of those problems, promising rebalancing for combat and gear as well as "performance updates" and bug fixes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=oiZfF5AO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=tESpoMn1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s first roadmap is aiming to address some of its most common sticking points.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as these fixes and rebalancing efforts, the February monthly update will also bring a new player character, new holobytes, and new enemies to fight, plus new affixes to experiment with.</p>

<p>Another monthly update will arrive in March, and it'll bring plenty of new stuff; new enemies and a new assassin are on the way, plus more performance updates and more rebalancing.</p>

<p>Following that, a significant new update is coming in April, and this one's big enough to get its own name. The Buried Below update continues the previous two updates' efforts with regards to rebalancing and bug fixing, but it also brings new areas, another new player character, and "improved onboarding".</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming before the game's 1.0 launch as well, although that launch still doesn't have a release date. You can see the full&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap right here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=vjJ4C1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=ZQ4dAe-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots on the way for&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light&nbsp;</em>series. Developed by Heart Machine, the game eschews its predecessor's top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style perspective in favor of a full 3D look, and it's a roguelike as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Drifter</em>'s handcrafted adventure.</p>

<p>While sales figures haven't been officially released, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>hasn't exactly performed as well as parent company Embracer would have liked, at least if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer" rel="nofollow">recent financial statement</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>, and if you'd like to know what our very own Austin thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking" rel="nofollow">take a look at his preview here</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castle-crashers">Castle Crashers</a>' has revealed more details of its first DLC for 13 years, and while we don't yet have a firm release date, we do have a window: summer (Q3) 2025.</p>
<p>Last summer - 12 years after it first arrived on Steam, and 16 years after it debuted on Xbox Live Arcade - Castle Crashers announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-is-getting-new-dlc-16-years-after-it-first-released">getting new DLC on Steam</a> (and only Steam - sorry, Xbox players).</p>
<p>Premium DLC Painter Boss Paradise not only includes new player and weapon artwork for all official characters and new character Paint Junior, but it also adds Steam workshop functionality, so players can create and share their own skins "with the world".</p>

<p>"After 16 years, when it came time to give Castle Crashers some more love, I started by drawing brand new knights," explained Dan Paladin, co-founder and art director at The Behemoth.</p>
<p>"I was able to do this fairly quickly and thought, 'Why shouldn't everyone have the ability to do this?', so - BOOM - the Painter Boss gave us all a perfect opportunity to make a natural shift to creating. People have wanted new characters so often - this allows the whole community to finally share more than we could ever give them!"</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the $4 DLC (regional pricing is still to be confirmed) is only coming to Steam. You can wishlist it now.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-hominid">Alien Hominid</a> HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 12.30pm UK:</strong> The first network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has suffered server issues and is unplayable.</p>
<p>The online co-op spin-off has a number of three hour long sessions over the course of the weekend, with the first meant to be from 11am - 2pm UK time today. However, server issues have meant players haven't been able to get past the initial menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890375131463082321">FromSoftware Player Support</a> has shared a number of messages, noting the server is "congested" before it restarted the server to solve the issue.</p>

<p>It's unclear how long it will take for servers to be reset, or if the remaining sessions will also be affected. After all, this is a network test - and the servers have clearly been tested.</p>
<p>I've contacted Bandai Namco for further details.</p>
<p>Myself, Eurogamer's Ian Higton and IGN's Jesse Gomez were planning to stream the game but have cancelled due to the server issues.</p>
<p>Players have been sharing their experience on social media and calling for FromSoftware to extend the sessions.</p>
<p>This was my view for over an hour of trying:</p>

<p>The test will continue over the weekend for those who registered, we have all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">details of Nightreign session times</a>.</p>
<p>To read about what you're missing, check out my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">hands-on preview of Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and watch Ian's video above.</p>
<p>"As it stands, though, Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," I wrote. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If your time with foundational PC strategy 4X game series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> consists of exactly one save file that ended somewhere in the Middle Ages, don't beat yourself up, for you have plenty of company. When they got hold of detailed audience data for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>'s new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.</p><!--more-->
<p>That 40% figure comes from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/arts/civilization-7-design-firaxis.html">an interview with the New York Times</a>, which pairs Firaxis insight with thoughts from academics and third party designers about Civilization's pretty well-rehearsed colonialist leanings. While the data refers to Civ 6 specifically, I'm pretty confident you can apply these findings to Civilization games in general. There's <a href="https://kotaku.com/nine-out-of-10-will-not-finish-the-game-they-are-playin-5832450">ample</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/17/gdc-most-players-donat-finish-games">evidence</a> to the effect that most video game players leave games unfinished, and 4X games in particular are arguably most fun at the outset while the world is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Among the NYT's interviewees is Indian game developer Nikhil Murthy, whose current project Syphilisation is both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation-is-a-ferociously-in-depth-empathic-reworking-of-civilization-and-other-4x-games">a post-colonial critique of Civilization and an investigation of Civ play possibilities</a> buried by the mantra of Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Murthy comments that Civilization's endgame-focussed "winner takes all" mindset has a flattening effect on all the fun you can have with its systems. New School professor McKenzie Wark elaborates upon Murthy's argument with the thought that the most intriguing Civ players are the "trifling" ones who don't really care about victory. "You're just interested in exploring the rule set," she told the paper. "So your civilization inevitably gets defeated, but you find little affordances as you go along."</p>
<p>The NYT piece is too brief to go into much detail here, sadly, but it reminds me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game">my own roundtable chat</a> about 4X design with Murthy, Paradox Interactive's Ryan Sumo and Civilization lead designer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jon-shafer">Jon Shafer</a> from 2023. At one point in that conversation, Shafer recalls that during his time at Firaxis, designers frequently heard that players enjoy "that first X-and-a-half, the exploration part and the initial expansion part, before you're really in competition".</p>
<p>Civ7 creative director Ed Beach also alludes to this in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/dev-diary/ages/">a developer diary about the Age system</a>. "From our perspective, not finishing the game is a signal that players are hitting points where they're no longer having fun," he writes. "We want everyone to have a great experience from start to finish. We know that players often feel the beginning hours of Civ are magical, and we want to make sure that every part of the game feels just as epic and exciting as that initial rush."</p>
<p>I can't tell you whether Firaxis have succeeded in this with Civilization 7. Our review remains forthcoming. But I am certainly among the players who favour the early game and prefer tinkering about as a mid-rank Civ to assuming a position of monotonous economic, cultural or military dominance. How about you, reader dear?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens to GTA Online when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> comes out? That’s a question a lot of GTA Online players have been asking ever since GTA 6 was announced. And now, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6’s fall 2025 release date</a> approaches, they’re no closer to an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> is Rockstar’s hugely profitable live service that continues to pull in players even now, well over a decade since launch. Its enduring appeal and ability to print money is thought to have influenced Rockstar’s decision to prioritize the live service over story DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5, much to the annoyance of some fans. But there is a more pressing concern looming over the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When GTA 6 eventually comes out, it is expected to bring with it a new and improved GTA Online. Perhaps this will be GTA Online 2. Perhaps it will be called GTA Online, as before. Either way, players of the existing GTA Online have expressed concern that all their time, effort, and money spent in the current GTA Online will be left behind for a potential clean break later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why invest time and money into GTA Online now, in early 2025, when the new GTA Online is potentially due out in perhaps eight months or so? That’s a question IGN put to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick during a recent interview ahead of the company’s third-quarter financial report, and his answer makes for interesting reading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zenick wouldn’t be drawn specifically on any new GTA Online because it has yet to be announced, he did talk generally about Take-Two’s form when it came to NBA 2K Online, a free-to-play online-focused version of 2K Sports’ hugely successful basketball franchise aimed at the Asian market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA 2K Online launched all the way back in 2012, and then 2K Sports released NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. Both games were maintained simultaneously, so fans of the first version could continue to play and invest their time and money safe in the knowledge they wouldn’t be left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm going to speak theoretically only because I'm not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn't been made,” Zelnick began. “But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles. As an example, we launched NBA 2K Online in China, I think originally in 2012 if I'm not mistaken. And then we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China in 2017. If I'm not mistaken. We did not sunset Online 1. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they're alive and we have this massive audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is of particular importance. It suggests — but doesn’t confirm at this stage — that if there is a GTA Online 2, it won’t come at the cost of GTA Online falling by the wayside. If people keep playing GTA Online, Zelnick is suggesting here, then Rockstar will continue to support it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there’s still a huge amount we do now know about GTA 6, given all we’ve had so far is Trailer 1 and a release window. But if GTA 6 is definitely due out fall 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">potentially after Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date</a>, Rockstar will have to reveal more sooner rather than later. In the meantime, check out Zelnick's comments on whether <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">skipping PC for GTA 6's launch is a mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Highlights included Housemarque’s reveal of its Returnal successor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-is-housemarques-successor-to-returnal-arriving-in-2026">Saros</a>, and the long-awaited release date for Konami’s Unreal Engine 5 remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-finally-confirmed-officially-this-time">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. But one notable video game was a total no-show: Bloodborne.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the persistence continues 😭 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bloodborne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#bloodborne</a> <a href="https://t.co/GOcAO4Bi5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GOcAO4Bi5g</a></p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1889812558040932572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As the 40-minute show wrapped up, most fans wiped off the clown makeup so they could inevitably rebuild expectations for some sort of comeback in the future. For others, the absence stung more than usual. March 24, 2025, marks the 10-year anniversary of Bloodborne’s launch on PS4, making this year feel like a now-or-never moment for PlayStation and developer FromSoftware to do... anything with the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne remaster campaigners have slowly grown their numbers over the last five years, but hopes for an announcement took on a new form when Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now"><u>issued a DMCA takedown</u></a> to Lance McDonald, the creator of a popular Bloodborne 60fps mod for the action RPG, late last month. Sony was calling for links to the patch to be scrubbed from the internet, and only one week later, a PlayStation 1-style demake called Bloodborne PSX <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-bloodborne-psx-demake-becomes-the-latest-fan-project-to-suffer-a-copyright-claim-the-creator-of-bloodbornes-60fps-mod-has-offered-his-copium-official-remake-theory"><u>suffered the same fate</u></a>. It’s not exactly a surprise to see Sony taking action against community creations like this, but the timing had many, <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>including McDonald</u></a>, raising their eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, Google searching for ‘Bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said. “Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just days after Sony moved to pull these fan-made projects down, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow-february-12th"><u>State of Play was announced</u></a>. After years of begging and nearly a decade since launch, this had to be it, right? Well, whether you were surprised or not, not one frame of Bloodborne found its way into the presentation, and fans haven’t been taking it well.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">another year no bloodborne <a href="https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7</a> <a href="https://t.co/VVohE0C4gp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VVohE0C4gp</a></p>— ۟ (@scadutree) <a href="https://twitter.com/scadutree/status/1889809555003154451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">some of you clearly didn't watch amazon's secret level playstation episode when Sackboy turned to the camera and said, "We will NEVER remake or remaster bloodborne!" <a href="https://t.co/Y89LwShCVh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y89LwShCVh</a></p>— Gene Park (@GenePark) <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1889814583868792917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/2BCcceRz2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2BCcceRz2z</a></p>— Micky D (@DeMickyD) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeMickyD/status/1889902996856947048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Driving the cleaver deeper was Sony’s promise to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-gone-remasered-revealed-with-april-2025-release-date">Days Gone Remastered</a> to PS5 owners in April. This re-release of Bend Studio’s post-apocalyptic narrative adventure arrives on the six-year anniversary of its original launch on PS4 and sees it joining a list of other first-party remasters that includes Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. No-one outside Sony is sure on what qualifies a game to be deserving of a remaster. With so many players begging to return to Yharnam’s beastly streets and with FromSoftware titles more popular than ever, it’s hard not to walk out of a Bloodborne-less State of Play without a question mark above your head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, as quiet as Sony has been when it comes to Bloodborne content, fans haven’t been completely starved of an explanation from it or FromSoftware. Former Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Shuhei Yoshida, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january"><u>retired last month</u></a>, touched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>his theory</u></a> as to why we’ve not seen more Bloodborne during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent conversation with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>. He suspects that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is too busy and too attached to the IP to let anyone else get involved other than himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on,” Yoshida said in January, “but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So, I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone thought with Bloodborne's 10 year anniversary approaching and Sony DMCA taking down the 60FPS patch that something was coming but uhhh...</p><p>Nope.</p><p>We get Days Gone Remastered lmao <a href="https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi</a></p></div>— Michael (@LegacyKillaHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1889816510497169759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki, meanwhile, has also addressed desires for a Bloodborne remaster and PC port. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>speaking with IGN last year</u></a>, the Dark Souls mastermind clarified that he wasn’t “at liberty to speak to it” because FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP rights. It’s fair reason to dodge the conversation around Bloodborne, though Miyazaki also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested to Eurogamer</u></a> that he believes a remake could benefit from modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,” the FromSoftware lead told Eurogamer early last year. “It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There has never been an official mention of a Bloodborne remaster, and 2025 is shaping up to be another year without some form of PS5 or PC port. As the PS5 barrels through its fifth full year on the market, one can only wonder when or if Sony will have anything to announce.

But from that company's perspective they have to think about things like 'do we actually legally own all of these?' or 'are we even allowed to own some of these things?'.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> studio Obsidian Entertainment has plans to make it to 100 years in the business, and will achieve this by staying "lean and invested".</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.dicesummit.org/">DICE Summit</a>, Obsidian VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of development Justin Britch said they expect the studio to make it to its 100th birthday, which will be in another 78 years time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/">PC Gamer</a>, the team hopes to reach this milestone by keeping the company lean and holding onto the talent it has. It will also set realistic goals when it comes to sales expectations, the execs said, and won't go all-in on delivering huge profits. "Are we serious? … Yes," Morgan said.</p>

<p>This strategy has meant Obsidian has refrained from opening multiple international offices, instead partnering with studios already in existence. This has reduced the risk of Obsidian getting too big and weakening the overall culture at the studio.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian works on the assumption that any game it releases will simply be a "mild success", and this determines how much the studio will invest in a project before it gets given the greenlight.</p>
<p>Obsidian also plans to build institutional knowledge by aiming for "the lowest turnover rate in the industry". Meanwhile, the studio will continue to release the types of games it has become known for "not rushed, but often".</p>
<p>Obsidian's most recent game - Avowed - is available next week, on 18th February. We recently awarded the magical RPG four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart. It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in DICE news, during the event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Blizzard announced Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed may be officially slated for February 18, but owners of the Premium Edition can already play it. As such, a technical report is in order.</p>
<p>I played the game extensively pre-release <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the review</a> and immediately noticed the game's solid performance across the board. As far as Unreal Engine 5 games go, this may be one of the smoothest I've played to date.</p>
<p>Sure, it isn't the most taxing. It is not, after all, an open world title, although its zones are fairly large. It also doesn't path tracing like Black Myth: Wukong, although its ray traced reflections look great on water surfaces, and the ray traced lighting and shadows definitely augment the visuals. More importantly, the stuttering is minimal, especially when you add a frame rate cap. That's always a worry for Unreal Engine games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Avowed-Shaders-Generation-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Obsidian has adopted the best practice of running shader generation when loading the game. It will take a while the first time, even with a high-end NVMe SSD like WD Black's SN850X. However, you'll only need to do it again after a driver update, otherwise the game will check them quickly and then load the main menu. The tradeoff is definitely advantageous compared to having the initial experience marred by stuttering.</p>
<p>During the review period, we didn't have access to NVIDIA DLSS 4 or Multi Frame Generation, as the game wasn't listed as supported on the NVIDIA app for the Override feature. Still, I ended up using the DLSS Swapper tool because subtitles were affected by ghosting. By default, Avowed uses a fairly old (3.5.10.0) version of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Updating to DLSS 4 easily fixed the problem, though Multi Frame Generation and DLAA were still unavailable.</p>
<p>That changed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-572-42-is-optimized-for-avowed-indiana-jones-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's GeForce Game Ready driver</a>. You can now select the latest DLSS 4 transformer model for Super Resolution, the improved AI-based Frame Generation model, as well as force Multi Frame Generation and DLAA through the NVIDIA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed PC 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen, GeForce RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRv4UwAC4-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features no built-in benchmark, so I had to come up with a custom solution. I decided to record performance with NVIDIA FrameView while roaming through Paradis, by far the largest city in Avowed with the most amount of NPCs. Of course, I used 4K resolution, and every setting was turned to the max (labeled Epic, as in most Unreal Engine games):</p>
<ul>
<li>View Distance</li>
<li>Shadow Quality</li>
<li>Texture Quality</li>
<li>Shading Quality</li>
<li>Effects Quality</li>
<li>Foliage Quality</li>
<li>Post-Processing Quality</li>
<li>Reflection Quality</li>
<li>Global Illumination Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing rig is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</li>
<li>MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI</li>
<li>32GB DDR5 6000 MHz G.SKILL Trident Z5</li>
<li>2TB NVMe SSD Western Digital Black SN850X</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition</li>
</ul>

<p>With DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, I had enough headway to run DLAA at 200 average frames per second. Dropping to DLSS Quality provided a 30% boost to the average frame rate, which averaged 260FPS when upscaling from 1440p to 4K. However, the stuttering time increased from 7.30% to 13.29%, likely because of the larger difference between the maximum and minimum frame rates. Indeed, when looking at the 0.1% Low, DLAA and DLSS Quality are nearly identical (118 and 123 FPS, respectively). On the flip side, latency is lower when using DLSS Quality, though the difference is just over 8 ms (40.9 ms with DLSS Quality, 49.1 ms with DLAA).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that the frame rate variance would be far lower when capping the frame rate, which you should absolutely do when actually playing the game. Indeed, during the review period, I capped the frame rate with the in-game slider to 120FPS and had a very smooth experience even without Multi Frame Generation.</p>

<p>Graphically, Avowed received a lot of criticism before its launch. However, the final version is nothing to complain about. In fact, it is often rather beautiful, thanks to the striking biomes and the highly detailed characters and armors. Sure, facial animations may not always be great, but only a handful of studios have really mastered that part of character rendering. As you can see above, the ray traced reflections are very pretty, though it's usually Lumen's lighting that elevates the visuals.</p>
<p>However, I do have to criticize Obsidian for its lack of native High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support. In 2025, this is nearly inexcusable, especially when the Xbox version supports not only HDR10 but Dolby Vision, too.</p>
<p>I had to resort to the Unreal Engine 5 HDR workaround <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Unreal_Engine_5#High_dynamic_range_.28HDR.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed on PC Gaming Wiki</a> to enable HDR. Basically, you need to add the following variables to the GameUserSettings.ini file:</p>
<p><em>[SystemSettings]</em><br>
<em>r.AllowHDR=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.EnableHDROutput=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.OutputDevice=5</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.ColorGamut=2</em></p>
<p>It's not nearly the same as having it natively supported and optimized, though. Hopefully, a patch can resolve this.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Avowed supports the DualSense Edge controller right away despite not having any PlayStation 5 version announced. Granted, you'll have the wrong icons and no Adaptive Triggers or Haptic Feedback, but regular rumble works just fine. Lastly, I had good results with my Dolby Atmos setup when upmixing via the Dolby Access app, which I take as a sign of great surround sound implementation. The game also features sliders for Field of View (from 90 to 105) and for motion blur.</p>
<p>When scrolling Avowed's credits, the game lists many supporting studios, including the Xbox Games Technology Group, which was created in 2023 inside The Coalition. The studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-coalition-shows-stunning-ue5-demo-running-on-xbox-series-x-nanite-allows-100x-detail-lumen-is-a-total-game-changer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the foremost Unreal Engine experts</a>, and I have little doubt that they were instrumental in helping Obsidian achieve their objectives with their game. In this regard, if nothing else, having the support of Xbox's teams has definitely leveled up the experience compared to The Outer Worlds.</p>
