</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em><a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/category/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> is the new standalone, not-DLC set in the world of <em>Elden Ring</em> by FromSoftware.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is condensed and distilled <em>Elden Ring</em>. It even takes place in a smaller version of the Lands Between. But that distillation also makes it faster, denser, and even more challenging. As weird as it is to describe any FromSoftware game this way, <em>Nightreign</em> makes <em>Elden Ring</em> look positively cozy in comparison.</p><p><strong>The following starter guide was <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/nightreign-what-you-should-know-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally</a> published by our friends at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Friendly Guide</a>, a new website devoted to game guides.

Below, we’re going to break down some important things you should know before diving into <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</p><h2><strong>What the hell is Elden Ring Nightreign?</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign</em> is a multiplayer, battle-royale-but-PvE game with roguelike elements. And what that means is, let’s just say it here, it’s kind of <em>Fortnite</em>-ified <em>Elden Ring</em>. You start an Expedition — a run — by <em>gliding</em> onto an <em>island</em> where there’s a shrinking <em>circle</em> that damages you if you get caught outside.</p><p>It’s not a battle royale, though. It’s you and two teammates against a parade of <em>Elden Ring</em> enemies that come from a wide range stages in the base game.</p><p>Your Expedition takes place across three days. Your ultimate goal is to earn Runes (by killing enemies) and pick up items throughout the day to level up both your character and your gear. Then, when the Night’s Tide (that shrinking circle) forces you to an arena at the end of that day, you’ll need to defeat a boss to progress to the next day. Day 2 is similar to day 1, and you and your buddies will need to work hard to get strong for the boss battles to come.&nbsp;</p><p>After the night fight on day 2, you’ll be teleported to just outside of a boss arena where you can level up if you have enough Runes or shop at a nearby merchant. You and your squad can then take on the Night Lord, the big boss that comes at the end of each Expedition. If you kill it, you win, and will progress the game. If you and your teammates go down during the boss fight — or any of the previous night fight — you’ll fail and will need to start a new Expedition from scratch at <em>Nightreign</em>‘s version of the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>And you’re going to fail. Often.</p><h2><strong>Leveling up is streamlined</strong></h2><p>Just like in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper, killing enemies earns you Runes, but you’re not out to kill every single enemy on the map. You’re here for one reason — to survive until the third night, which means surviving three circles, defeating at least three (probably more) bosses, and then fighting the chosen Night Lord. And doing that means leveling up.</p><p>You do this at Sites of Grace scattered around the island. In <em>Nightreign</em>, the leveling up process is much simpler than in <em>Elden Ring</em>. You only have one stat to adjust — your level — and that adjusts all of your other stats.</p><p>How fast and easy <em>Nightreign</em> makes leveling up is good because …</p><h2>Elden Ring Nightreign is chaotic</h2><p>When you head out on an Expedition, it’s chaos. It’s you and two strangers — who you can’t talk to, as there’s no in-game voice chat — dropped onto an island with a lot of shiny distractions and no plan for where to go.</p><p>If you want to survive, stick with your party and watch for the shrinking circle of deadly (tick damage) rain. Use the pin function on the map to suggest destinations, but be ready to head in the opposite direction if you get outvoted (or your teammates just ignore your pin).</p><p>Speaking of …</p><h2><strong>Resist the urge to act like you’re playing solo</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is a multiplayer game. And while you can play solo, it is both very tough and removes the down-but-not-out state, which is a real (literal) lifesaver in combat. Solo runs are theoretically doable, and there’s no doubt that some absolute heroes out there will make it work for them, but it’s definitely not ideal for your first time through the game. It’s much more fun to play with other players — even if you don’t know them and aren’t communicating at all — than playing by yourself.</p><p>With that in mind, it’s important to play with your team once you do actually load into a match. You’re at your strongest when you’re playing together and working to help grow everyone’s power, not just your own.</p><h2>Item drops are shared</h2><p>When you kill an enemy, smash a crate, or open a chest, the items that drop aren’t for you alone — they’re shared and collectable across everyone in the party. Sometimes, that means you’re going to be racing to pick up the good stuff. Sometimes, that also means you’ll be better served by letting someone else grab that cool sword. Basically, don’t be a dick.</p><h2><strong>Treat smithing stones and extra flask charges like gold</strong></h2><p>Finding new weapons and leveling up is critical to success as you advance through <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. But there are other things you need to focus on as well in order to boost your power. Namely, you should be looking for smithing stones and visiting churches.&nbsp;</p><p>The smithing stones will allow you to upgrade your weapon’s rarity, which can drastically increase its damage output. While you’re leveling up, you should definitely save some Runes for a smithing stone before you take on the Night Lord at the end of your Expedition.&nbsp;</p><p>As you come across churches mid-Expedition, look for the giant, angelic statue. Interact with the altar in front of it to add a healing charge to your flask.</p><h2>Traversal is a lot faster and jumpier</h2><p>Jumping is a lot more important in <em>Nightreign</em>. And there’s a wall jump now that essentially lets you climb vertically on certain surfaces. Oh, and there’s no fall damage in this version of the Lands Between.</p><p>This is good, since every Expedition involves a lot of headlong sprinting across the landscape and you’re going to take some big falls when you’re not paying attention. But it also means there are more options for climbing and just generally getting around the island.</p><h2><strong>Just because you find a boss doesn’t mean you should fight a boss</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>As you sprint across the map with your buds, you’re going to encounter a ton of different enemies from <em>Elden Ring</em>. They’ll come from every stage, area, and difficulty of the game, all mixed together.</p><p>Some of those enemies will be bosses. Bosses can drop some great loot alongside a ton of Runes — both of which you’ll need for any successful run. But, if you’re not prepared, those bosses can also wipe out your entire party, ending your Expedition before it even gets started.</p><p>There’s only so much you can accomplish over the course of a day, so don’t get too caught up fighting the biggest and baddest thing you encounter. Sometimes it’s better to save those fights until you get more powerful.</p><h2>Relics make you more powerful</h2><p>Not every buff and stat increase happen during an Expedition. At the Roundtable Hold, you can equip Relics by performing Relic Rites.</p><p>Relics are color-coded items that give you benefits on all future expeditions. They do things like add poison damage to your starting weapon or increase your resistances — you’ll need all the help you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll earn Relics at the end of every Expedition, so even failed runs can benefit you.</p><h2><strong>Watch the UI for critical info</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>The UI in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is packed with obvious and not-so-obvious details that are extremely important to look out for. One of the more obviously helpful notifications is one that you can easily miss if you’re too focused on the fights happening all around you: the circle closing.</p><p>The game will tell you the Night Rain is coming toward you via a message box that says “rains gather, portending the tide of Night” in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, just under your Rune counter. Once you get the notification, you’re going to want to mark the safe zone and book it — depending on where you are in the circle, you won’t have much time to get to the next area.</p><p>A not-so-obvious helpful UI tip is that you can tell when you have enough Runes to level up just by looking at the top left-hand corner of your screen. To the left of your current level, you’ll see an arrow pointing up over and over again if you’re rich enough to jump to the next level. Levels are extremely valuable in <em>Nightreign</em>, so make sure you hit a Site of Grace before the next boss fight if you see that arrow.</p><p><strong>For more tips, tricks and guides, visit <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/nightreign-what-you-should-know-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Friendly Guide</a>.</strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract"><h3>Zenimax Union Reaches Tentative Contract With Microsoft</h3></a><p>The QA worker union has been bargaining for nearly two years</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is intended as an online co-op game for three players, or solo, but with no option to only play in pairs unless they match with a random third wheel. While a three-person group is quite common in online games, including Apex Legends and Destiny, the lack of a duo option has not gone down well for folks who just want to play with a friend or partner. It's one of the criticisms highlighted amongst the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">negative reviews on Steam</a>, where the game is currently sitting at a "Mixed" rating. </p><p>The lack of a Duos Mode was made clear during Elden Ring Nightreign's announcement and game director Junya Ishizaki also explained in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview back in December that the reason behind focusing on three players was "largely a game balancing decision, rather than a game design decision." In a later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview ahead of the game's launch, Ishizaki did however admit that duos were "kind of overlooked and neglected" and hinted that support may come post-launch.</p><p>While nothing has been officially confirmed, this is yet another example of modders stepping in to add such missing features to a game.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, X.box One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Time to choose your Nightfarer and set out into Limveld in hopes of defeating the Nightlord before you’re lost to the rains.

His Sixth Sense passive allows you to cheat death and stay up through one instance of fatal damage. As a generalist, he doesn't excel with any specific weapons, but can use most martial armaments. His favorite weapon is the Greatsword.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/wylder-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wylder Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Guardian</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-3-guardian-1748614612549.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian is Nightreign's tank class. He's most comfortable wielding a large shield and a weapon that can be used while guarding, such as a Halberd, Rapier, or Hand Crossbow. The Guardian deals less damage than the other Nightfarers, but has immense durability and multiple ways to disrupt foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/guardian-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guardian Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ironeye</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-4-ironeye-1748614631528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironeye is the bow specialist, though his high Dexterity makes him proficient with a variety of other melee weapons such as daggers and curved swords. Unfortunately, his low durability makes him a poor choice as a front-line fighter, so use melee weapons with caution. Overall, his abilities are simple to use, making him an excellent choice for beginners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/ironeye-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ironeye Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Duchess</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-5-duchess-1748614659315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duchess is a dagger-wielding Nightfarer who excels at evasive action to weave in and out of combat. Her starting weapon comes with a potent character skill, enchanting your blade with the Magic affinity for extra damage. In addition, she can adeptly wield Glintstone Sorceries due to her high intelligence, and she has decent Faith scaling for Incantations as well. For the Duchess, look out for weapons with the Magic or Frost Affinity, and those that can trigger statuses like Frostbite or Blood Loss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/duchess-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Duchess Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Raider</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-6-raider-1748614679688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider has high Strength and uses large/colossal weapons to smash his foes. While he can use a variety of martial armaments well, his FP is extremely low, making it difficult to use weapon skills. The Raider's inherent durability makes him difficult to stagger, helping him ensure that his blows connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/raider-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Raider Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Revenant</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-7-revenant-1748614720933.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Revenant is a support class, though her high Faith allows her to use offensive Incantations with ease. However, her ability to deal damage is limited as she has no method of FP recovery. Her passive ability summons the shades of foes to fight at your side, distracting enemies and dealing damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/revenant-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Revenant Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Recluse</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-8-recluse-1748614743897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spellcaster adept who can use her character skill to restore FP, the Recluse excels at unleashing devastation from afar. Her stats favor Sorceries and Incantations, but she can use Magic, Frost, Fire, Holy, and Lightning affinity weapons. This character is a bit more difficult to play as you don't have as many defensive options, and need to manage FP in addition to your Health and Stamina. However, if you do everything correctly, she deals significant damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/recluse-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Recluse Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Executor</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-9-executor-1748614759386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Executor excels in single combat. He has high Dexterity and Arcane, giving him access to a majority of the game's smaller weapons. Look out for Katanas in particular, as these scale off of Dexterity while also triggering the Blood Loss status to enemies. Position carefully because the Executor has low durability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/executor-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Executor Character Guide</u></a></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightreign Map Guides</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-10-map-1748614774402.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Limveld map is teeming with points of interest to explore. Maxroll’s Limveld Map &amp; Key Locations guide teaches you about the various encounters, what mob types to expect, and the rewards you can earn for clearing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore, you'll encounter random events known as <strong>Raid Events</strong> which often involve fighting a challenging foe. If you clear the raid, you earn a valuable Power for the remainder of your run; learn more with Maxroll’s Raid Events guide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating Nightlords unlocks Shifting Earth events. Each of these events transforms a quadrant of the map into a unique zone, frequently filled with lots of bosses to fight - and similar to Raid Events, they award a special power when cleared.

Here, you can switch your characters, perform Relic Rites to prepare for the next expedition, test things in the Sparring ground, read up on the game with the Visual Codex, explore your character’s story at the Journal, and set out from the Table of Lost Grace to do battle against a Nightlord. Learn about all this in Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/roundtable-hold" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roundtable Hold guide.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Relics</strong> and <strong>Vessels</strong> are part of Nightreign’s metaprogression system. At the end of each run, you earn Relics and Murk, which you can spend at the Small Jar Bazaar. Some Relics have random affixes that may or may not be useful, whereas others (often earned through character quests or by defeating bosses) have fixed stats and are quite powerful. As you progress in the game, you also unlock additional Vessels, letting you equip a different Relic combination on your Nightfarer. Learn more about this system with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/relics-vessels-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relics and Vessels guide</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the Sorceries and Incantations in Nightreign belong to a specific Spell School. The Spell School determines which modifiers buff your spells - for example, a Glintstone Sorcery won't benefit from bonuses to Godslayer Incantations. This isn't very clearly explained, though, so if you’re curious on how to buff your Spells, check out Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/incantation-sorcery-types" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorcery and Incantation School Guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll's Nightreign Database</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-12-database-1748614846283.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Browse Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/getting-started/elden-ring-nightreign-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Database</strong></u></a> to learn more about the Weapons, skills, spells, Relics, Vessels, Relic modifiers, Talismans, passive traits, and Nightfarers available in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-expansion-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we first reviewed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-mandalorian-adventures-review-is-this-way" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em></a> here on TechRaptor, we were truly impressed by the depth of the game and replay value contained within the core box. But every adventure, no matter how great, deserves a second season (or more)! Which is why we're thrilled to preview <em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>, which the fine folks at <a href="https://unexpectedgames.com/clanoftwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unexpected Games</a> (via distributor <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-expansion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee USA</a>) sent along a copy of for us to check out!</p>



<p><em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>&nbsp;is an expansion to&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>, inspired by events taking place in the second season of&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian</em>. With new heroes to play as and new missions to tackle, this great expands the base game - but, be warned,&nbsp;<strong>you need the base game to be able to play&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Box Contents Include:</strong></p>

<ul><li>1 Rulebook</li>
	<li>1 Mission Book</li>
	<li>95 Cards (Including 4 New Heroes)</li>
	<li>18 Mini Cards</li>
	<li>137 Tokens</li>
	<li>4 Standees</li>
	<li>2 Mercenary Mission Sheets (Double-Sided)</li>
</ul><h2>What New Heroes Are Included In&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two?</em></h2>

<p>There are four new heroes included in&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two&nbsp;</em>that you can play as with both these expansion missions and the missions included in the core game. These include: the exiled Jedi Ahsoka Tano, famed bounty hunter Boba Fett, Mandalorian heiress Bo-Katan Kryze, and master assassin and sharpshooter&nbsp;Fennec Shand.</p>

<p>Each of these characters also have new persistent character abilities, changing how they play and making them feel wholly unique compared to the characters contained in the core box. Let's take a look hero by hero and chat briefly about their abilities!</p>

<h3>Ahsoka Tano</h3>
<p>Ahsoka Tano's hero card may seem like it comes with a major drawback - she can only attack enemies within the same space as her? But along with it perfectly fitting her flavor (she is, after all, a lightsaber wielder), but with her "Shoto Lightsaber" card shown above (of which she has two in her deck), she could potentially dish out 6 damage!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-fett.jpg?itok=HVgHcCQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-fett.jpg?itok=wqQ4FR6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Everyone's favorite bounty hunter Boba Fett blasts onto the scene with the persistent character ability you see above, allowing him to attack twice in a turn (as long as there aren't too many other cards in the action slot). Another great ability that gives you a huge benefit while also making you think carefully about how you play!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-cards.jpg?itok=Ew8KNleG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-cards.jpg?itok=qsEjwT9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boba Fett is, as expected, extremely combat focused, with cards that help you mitigate his character ability's downside of strength restriction in action spaces.</figcaption></figure><h3>Bo-Katan</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan.jpg?itok=C6SBbUou 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan.jpg?itok=zasn13Pp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bo-Katan is the most unique of any hero we've seen come to the game, as her persistent character ability says that she has to keep the top card of her skill deck faceup! This is a very fun mechanic, leading to a lot of shenanigans with trying to manipulate your skill deck to get the most out of her every turn, while giving you a bit of extra info you wouldn't normally know.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan-cards.jpg?itok=ma0w-DqC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan-cards.jpg?itok=iycHl-mv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bo-Katan's cards truly focus on her ability to use and manipulate her skill deck, and is one of the trickier (but more satisfying) characters to play.</figcaption></figure><h3>Fennec Shand</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-shand.jpg?itok=zDQlndW2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-shand.jpg?itok=8fGyMqfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fennec Shand is an unparalleled sniper in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;universe, and her ability to increase the range of her attack by one (at the cost of one strength) will make her close some pretty incredible distances in the game. Remember, three spaces can often feel like half the board when you're winding around the map!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-cards.jpg?itok=d3eYZN8o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-cards.jpg?itok=FoJzAakf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fennec is especially good at keeping enemy forces reined in and pinging out damage around the board.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are The New Missions Like In&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two?</em></h2>

<p>The new missions in&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>&nbsp;break the mold from the original game in fun and challenging ways, while providing a diverse set of challenges and maps that require different plans of attack! I don't want to spoil too much (that's part of the fun of playing&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>), so I'll stick with showing off and describing a bit about the first of the four missions in this expansion, which recreates the thrilling fight against the warlord Morgan Elsbeth on Calodan.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-map-mission.jpg?itok=70oggOCw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-map-mission.jpg?itok=IWmXa5bM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This first mission really feels like a race against time, as each time you trigger the 6+ space you'll be advancing the power track - this increases the hit points on Morgan Elsbeth, who you'll need to flush out&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;saving three different prisoners. It's a tough one, right out the gate, and introduces enemies with new abilities.</p>

<p>Along with the four core missions, there are also two new mercenary missions included in this expansion - and it all goes together to form what seems to me to be an extremely strong expansion. It's more of what we loved about&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>, but the abilities on these four new heroes feel&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;different!</p>

<p>With an MSRP at $39.99, this feels like a perfect addition if you've played through and explored all that the original&nbsp;<em>Mandalorian Adventures</em>&nbsp;had to offer. Hitting shelves everywhere Friday, June 6th!</p>

It’s a strange game, but one which I’ve played through twice and enjoyed thoroughly. If you like <em>Borderlands </em>and haven’t played this looter shooter spin-off yet, now is a great time to hop in. And if you’re excited about <em>Borderlands 4,</em> launching in September, <em>Wonderlands</em> will keep you busy until then. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest set of the trading card game based on iconic Disney characters will be getting a new format, new products, and a gift box featuring the ice queen, Elsa.</p>



<p>As part of their Weekly Lorecast on their official Twitch channel, Ravensburger showcased their <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview. The preview centered on official products and accessories alongside the full <em>Fabled</em>&nbsp;lineup of booster packs, Illumineer's Troves, and starter decks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-starter-deck-artwork.jpg?itok=jHy3WL1o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-starter-deck-artwork.jpg?itok=VFwLfCB1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who want to get into <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, the two starter decks are a decent entry point.The first is an Emerald and Ruby deck sporting Max, Goofy, and Powerline from <em>A Goofy Movie</em>. The other deck, showcasing Ariel and Mulan, is an Amber and Sapphire deck. Both will be sold at an MSRP of $16.99 each.</p>

<p>The new products and accessories will portray other characters featured in the set. Those accessories are a pair of <em>Goofy Movie</em> and <em>Mulan</em>-themed card sleeve packs and deck cases. The card sleeves will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99, and the deck boxes will be sold at an MSRP of $5.99.</p>

<p>In addition, two playmats will be available. One spotlights Cinderella as she gets her gorgeous dress from her fairy godmother. The other showcases Mufasa, King of Pride Rock. Both playmats will be available at an MSRP of $19.99</p>

The box will contain five booster packs, an Elsa-themed storage box, three punch-out dividers, and a glimmer foil promo card of <em>Elsa - The Fifth Spirit</em>. This Elsa Gift Box will be available this October at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview has confirmed the launch of two new formats. The first, Super Sealed, is a variation on a sealed draft. You get four boosters from each of the most recent sets. From there, you must make a three-ink color deck of 50 cards in under 60 minutes.</p>

<p>You are allowed to change cards between matches, but must revert back to the initial deck after each round and before the start of a new match.</p>

<p>The second format is called Triple Deck Constructed Format (Single Elimination). As the name implies, players create three decks, each covering all six ink colors. Players then play best-of-three against one another. You can even use an ink token to "bench" one of your opponents decks. The Grand Finals are determined in a best-of-five.</p>

<p><em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> will have a pre-release on August 29. The set's full release will be September 5.</p>

                <p>As the video game industry shifts from physical media to a digital future, game preservation is an increasingly relevant topic. Saving the history of the medium is important, and one gaming historian has just successfully preserved one of the rarest video games ever made.</p><p>Video game scholar Bruno de Figueiredo has announced (via <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/one-of-the-rarest-video-games-in-history-has-finally-been-preserved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>) that he has posted the ISO online for TRIPITAKA, the sequel to Cosmology of Kyoto. The original title was released in 1993 in Japan by SoftEdge, and this non-linear adventure game was released in North America the following year where it gained a small following. The sequel is so obscure that only a single physical copy of TRIPITAKA is known to exist.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/dieubussy/status/1925575872720822422" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">After a long search, uncertain that it even existed, I finally located the CD-ROM TRIPITAKA 玄奘三蔵求法の旅, the elusive sequel to the legendary Cosmology of Kyoto.

After nearly two years, Figueiredo successfully convinced the owner to allow him to share the game online for posterity.</p><p>Last year, Xbox put together <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-put-together-a-new-team-focused-on-game-preservation/1100-6522463/" data-ref-id="1100-6522463">a team dedicated to game preservation</a>, while Sony set up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-has-set-up-a-new-game-preservation-department/1100-6502798/" data-ref-id="1100-6502798">its own game preservation team</a> two years prior. Nintendo has taken a more dim view of game preservation, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-game-key-cards-are-a-little-disheartening-for-game-preservation-says-dev/1100-6531262/" data-ref-id="1100-6531262">the upcoming Switch 2 game key cards</a> has caused some to question how the games attached to them will be saved for future generations.

                <p>EA confirmed this week that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">canceled its upcoming Black Panther game and closed its developer, Cliffhanger Games</a>. A new report provides more context and background as to the situation surrounding the game's cancellation and what the game was aiming to be.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that the Black Panther game recently passed a development milestone, and the project was gaining momentum. However, sources said EA executives were upset that the game was still in pre-production after almost four years of work. After a portfolio review from EA management, the company reportedly chose to axe games in development for an extended period of time without making sufficient progress, and this included Black Panther.</p><p>Also canceled in this process were multiple titles at Apex Legends and Titanfall studio Respawn, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">including a new Titanfall game</a>, according to previous reporting.</p><p>EA's Black Panther game was going to build on some of the ideas that Cliffhanger boss Kevin Stephens had worked on with the Shadow of Mordor series when he was at Warner Bros., including the Nemesis system, the report said. For the Black Panther game, T'Challa, Killmonger, and Shuri would be playable characters, vying to become the new Black Panther.</p><p>Players were going to fight against the Skrull shapeshifting aliens, who had come to Wakanda. Some of these characters in the game might be impostors, and would have remembered and learned from player behavior, similar to how orcs in Shadow of Mordor would remember players and act based on previous interactions.</p><p>Developers had a hard time showcasing what made the Black Panther game special in presentations with management, and processes were slowed due to the team building a game and a new studio at the same time, the report said.</p><p>Following the game's cancellation, staffers who worked on the project spoke out to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-panther-devs-mourn-eas-stunning-and-amazing-game/1100-6531912/" data-ref-id="1100-6531912">praise the work the team did on what they hoped would be an "amazing" game.</a> While the Black Panther game is no longer moving ahead, EA is still building an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">Iron Man game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-black-panther-game-is-canceled-but-it-has-three-marvel-games-still-in-development/1100-6531945/" data-ref-id="1100-6531945">multiple Marvel projects as part of a multi-game deal with Marvel.</a></p><p>EA's Black Panther game is dead, but Amy Hennig's Marvel game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522227/" data-ref-id="1100-6522227">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, features Black Panther prominently.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/is-generative-ai-really-just-a-tool<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI is inevitable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a phrase that's rattled around my head for a month. Not willingly mind you. It's taken up lodging in my grey matter after hearing it in meetings, reading it in emails, and seeing it buffeted back and forth across Bluesky, LinkedIn, and Discord.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not a convincing phrase. If you hear it from AI boosters it's easy to brush off as raw hype, and if you hear it from doomsayers it can lull you into a sense of fatalism. But as the philosopher Natasha Bedingfield </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/b7k0a5hYnSI?si=wpIbqOH5OM9T3WeS">told us in 2004</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, today is where the book begins, the rest is still unwritten. Nothing, for better or worse, is inevitable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in those various calls another phrase—one you may have heard at your studio—has slipped past more unnoticed: "AI is just a tool. It can be used for good or evil, like any other tool."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After all this is a business where we use tools for good or evil, right and wrong, correctly and incorrectly. We debate the effectiveness of Unity, Unreal, or Godot. We agonize over whether to use procedural versus hand-crafted content. We debate and discuss the topic so much that Game Developers Conference has a whole </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/tools-summit">Tools Summit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> dedicated to craft of making game development software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Viewing generative AI through the neutral lens of tool assessment is natural—and I'll go so far as to say admirable—for our community. It's a method we use to get past hype and bombast, to try and take technology on its own terms and see how it fits our purposes. And as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-2025-state-of-the-game-industry-devs-weigh-in-on-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 GDC State of the Industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> report tells us, some developers are adopting generative AI, plenty of them not bought in on the hype but through the act of seeking the right tool for the job.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/is-nvidia-s-ai-driven-npc-tech-just-really-expensive-improv-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Is NVIDIA's AI-driven NPC tech just really expensive improv?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But looking at generative AI as 'just a tool' is a deeply flawed lens. That phrase betrays a quiet cynicism (one we hear often from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/RYa-_lrG3H8?si=GTDXPf9__8MOWGZg">opponents of firearm regulation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the United Stats). Because nothing—not generative AI, not a firearm, not even a hammer—is "just a tool."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The function of tools is influenced by their form">The function of tools is influenced by their form</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Consider two tools found in many American households: the claw hammer and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145">the handgun</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Normally Game Developer restricts itself to the craft of making video games but I promise this is relevant. Guns are another tool where neutralizing rhetoric is deployed to downplay a tool's negative effects. I grew up in a gun-owning house in a gun-owning neighborhood in suburban Maryland. There were probably four handguns sitting in lockboxes across two rooms, a few rifles and shotguns in a vault in the basement, and one questionably legal World War I firearm tucked away in a closet. The NRA's mantra of "guns don't kill people, people kill people" was commonplace. A neighbor of mine laughed when I advocated for stronger regulations on gun ownership on the basis of "guns are meant to kill." "Guns aren't meant to kill," I recall him saying. "Cars can kill people. Does that mean cars are meant for killing?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His point boils down to this: The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>outcome </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">of the tool's use is not worth considering when discussing regulation, only its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>potential </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">use. A gun is a tool and the user has control over a tool is used.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cars are already tightly regulated and cost thousands of dollars, making his point moot, so we'll break down the construction of the claw hammer instead. We generally refer to hammers as being used to pound nails into wood, but I mainly use mine for hammering anchors into drywall because I'm a theater kid and was taught in crew to trust screws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In either case, the physical shape of the claw hammer dictates its most common purpose. The handle extends into a metal object that is blunt at one end, and clawed on the other. The design follows the swing of the human arm, transferring kinetic energy generated by the bicep, down the elbow, through the wrist, and into the blunt end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also know that claw hammers are not useful for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>every</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> form of transferring this energy. Variations on hammer design like the ball-peen hammer show how this basic purpose needs to be altered for different tasks. The shape and the material changes depending on the purpose. To sell more hammers, companies invest in better materials and affordances like rubber grips to make their use more comfortable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a firearm, hammers can be used as weapons. That same transference of force can be used to harm another living being. Video games sometimes place hammers in a players' loadout alongside guns, grenades, and weapons of war.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neither the hammer nor the firearm is "just" a tool. They are tools that are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>optimized</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a purpose. We can study that purpose, and cast judgements about a tool's safety, merits, and need to be regulated based on that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>But</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The shape of the hammer is not an efficient way to inflict harm. This is supported by data from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/shr">FBI Crime Statistics survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which gathers data filed by police departments that participate in assembling data. "Handgun" is the most common weapon used in homicides, and "knife/cutting instrument" ranks higher than "blunt objects." That's because handguns are an incredibly efficient means of wounding living beings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's break down the handgun the way we did the hammer. Handguns are assembled from an assortment of components that transfer the squeeze of a trigger into the strike of a hammer against a firing pin, which strikes the primer of a bullet's cartridge and sends it propelling out of the tube. Though some bullets seen in larger firearms are meant to penetrate metal, a handgun's bullet is envisioned and designed to cut through flesh.</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These constraints make handguns efficient at few other tasks. In a pinch you could use the butt of a handgun as a hammer. I can't find any data about them being used for that purpose. I can only wander onto a construction site and count the number of firearms in toolboxes as a general sample size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neither the hammer nor the firearm is "just" a tool.

We can study that purpose, and cast judgements about a tool's safety, merits, and need to be regulated based on that.

		<p>It’s barely been out a day, but the internet has had its say on Elden Ring Nightreign, and it’s said, “Ooh missus, it’s a bit hard when I’m playing by myself.”</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are listening and have announced an upcoming patch that will include “improvements for solo expeditions”, specifically that “the effect “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat”, which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.” Additionally, the amount of runes gained will be increased.&nbsp;The Nightreign patch will also include the usual round of bug fixes and improvements,</p>


<p>From Software also revealed that they had sold 2 million copies of the game in a single day.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> revealed a lot about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">now-canceled Black Panther game</a> from EA and Cliffhanger Studios. The report discusses a number of the challenges the game faced in its four years of development and some details about what the game would have included if it had been able to get across the finish line.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's report, EA's decision to cancel Black Panther and close Cliffhanger Games came down to the game not being far enough along in its development. Sources told Schreier that executives at EA were "<em>frustrated</em>" with the game still being in its pre-production phase, and that even though the game had recently gained some momentum, it was all seemingly too little too late in the minds of EA's top brass.</p>
<p>As to why development was moving at a slower pace, the report points to two key factors, the first being the fact that since Cliffhanger was only founded in 2021, the studio was still in the process of expanding and scaling its team to support the development of a big triple-A Black Panther game. The other falls to the studio's ambitions with the game, which was to create a system similar to Monolith's famous Nemesis system, and the issues that come with developing procedural narrative games, and then showcasing the game to executives.</p>
<p>According to the report, the game "<em>was to feature various playable heroes from the comic-book universe, such as T’Challa, Killmonger and Shuri, all competing for the mantle of Black Panther</em>," and that Marvel's infamous shapeshifting aliens, the Skrulls, would have been allies to the heroes.</p>
<p>However, as Skrulls are known to do, some would have posed as allies, and "<em>others might have remembered the player’s behavior and acted accordingly</em>," which is where similarities to the nemesis system come into play.</p>
<p>But the slow progress in the game's development and EA executives seemingly not being able to see how the game would shape up led to the news that was revealed earlier this week, and EA's third <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">mass layoff</a> this year alone.</p>
<p>Despite Black Panther being canceled, both <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-marvels-collaboration-remains-strong-after-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-committed-to-making-three-games-based-on-marvel-characters/">EA and Marvel claim that their relationship "<em>remains strong</em>,"</a> and that EA will still develop three games based on Marvel characters, the first being Motive's Iron Man game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-never-too-late-to-talk-about-a-video-game.1203123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're sans Nathan on this week's Aftermath Hours, so Riley, Luke, and Isaiah intend to talk about a lot of topics, but mostly we can’t keep ourselves from talking about <em>Clair Obscur</em>, which everyone but me has finished. But we all agree that I'm far from having the missed the boat, and that there's still plenty of people out there who want to talk about games even once their launch hype dies down.</p><p>We start by talking about two stories Aftermath ran this week: <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one in favor of parrying in video games</a>, and one <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against</a>. Those stories kicked off a flurry of discourse on social media, which we found mostly to be in good fun. We talk about how different those kinds of conversations feel now that we’re at Aftermath instead of a larger site, and ponder what it is about <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/clair-obscur-expedition-33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur</a>'s </em>parrying system that kicked off everybody's parrying opinions in the first place.</p><p>Then, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week’s layoffs at Electronic Arts</a>, which follow on the heels of <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>other</em> layoffs at Electronic Arts</a>. We wonder why several companies have run into trouble with licensed games, and we talk about the challenge of getting players excited about Marvel games when <a href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MCU is facing its own uphill battle</a>.</p><p>Last, we talk about what games we’re playing lately. Luke goes through a lot of games <a href="https://aftermath.site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-tactical-takedown-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he didn’t like</a> before landing on one he did, <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9 Kings</a></em>. I lament not playing <em>Clair Obscur</em> faster, so then we talk about that game a whole bunch more, and we debate whether it can ever be “too late” to talk about a video game. Working in games journalism sometimes skews our perspective about what it means to be part of the conversation around a game, but we all agree that Aftermath gives us a chance to talk about games at a pace that's more similar to regular players instead of people who do this for a living.</p><p>To close, we answer some mailbag questions about the best <a href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrestling moves</a>, what we’d do if we were CEO of EA, and who we trust to give us game recommendations. &nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

                <p>The Communications Workers of America, the union representing QA testers at ZeniMax, announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement on a labor contract with Microsoft. If implemented, this contract will be one of the first to go into effect at one of the big AAA game publishers.</p><p>Last month, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">voted to authorize a strike</a> in response to challenges to the contract negotiation process; this agreement would avoid a strike from being carried out. In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, CWA shared that the agreed contract would grant ZeniMax employees significantly increased protections and would raise pay across the board. It would also implement guidelines on the use of AI, restrict "arbitrary dismissal," and create processes to ensure that QA testers adequately receive credit in video games that they contribute to.</p><p>QA testing has been a hotspot of unionization efforts in the games industry, some of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/" data-ref-id="1100-6524209">have been targeted with union-busting efforts</a>. At ZeniMax, the QA testers' union represents around 300 employees and has been fighting for several years for this contract. In response to the agreement, Jessee Leese, a QA tester and union representative at ZeniMax, stated, "Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve."</p><p>In early 2023, ZeniMax employees created ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, a coalition of CWA units embedded in the company that was made possible under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-formally-agrees-to-recognize-activision-blizzard-union/1100-6504549/" data-ref-id="1100-6504549">Microsoft's neutrality agreement with union activism.</a> Since then, unionization has expanded at Microsoft to include more teams; earlier in May, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard announced that it has fully unionized</a>. There are now over 2,000 unionized employees at Microsoft.</p><p>This contract still needs to complete several hurdles before it can be fully implemented. Now that both parties have tentatively agreed, the union will hold a series of explanation sessions for its members to learn about its provisions. Then, in late June, CWA expects to hold a ratification vote among its members.</p><p><i>Disclosure: The author of this article is a member of CWA by way of a graduate student union. </i></p>

<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but its requirements are even higher than what we've seen in most cases. According to the developers, you'll need a GeForce RTX 4090 to play at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second on Ultra settings. This is already with upscaling enabled, too.</p>

<p>The good news is that everyone can test Hell Is Us for themselves very soon. Rogue Factor also announced that a demo will be released on Steam, where it will be playable between June 2 and 16. Console users won't get any demo due to 'technical constraints'.</p>
<p>The demo starts right at the beginning of the game. This introduction is designed to ease players into Hell is Us and its core gameplay systems. It won't reveal everything that the full game has to offer; Rogue Factor said that some of the key elements, such as exploration and the evolving player experience, are best appreciated as the world opens up and the layers unfold.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, the studio also discussed the game's difficulty settings. It's meant to be a challenging experience, but there will be tweakable settings. There are three preset levels, and players can also choose a more granular control, customizing things like enemy health, enemy damage, enemy aggressiveness, and death penalty.</p>
<p>Hell Is Us will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

		<p>In desperation, the extraordinary becomes possible.</p><p>It’s how I felt when <em>VICE</em> told me that seven years was, well, long enough. Many of my colleagues had started their own businesses, but I was not a business person. I can write, I can podcast, I can stream. Numbers? That’s what a calculator is for. Many times, I’ve stayed at a bad job because a bad job was better than hustling for a new one. </p><p><em>Own</em> my own company? No.</p><p>Except, over time, no became “maybe” and then with some nudging, maybe became “yes.” Two years later, one of the best things that ever happened to me was losing my job, striking out on my own, and owning fate. It’s weird to think that failure on your own terms is less of an existential threat than failure because some random executive decided they weren’t interested in your contributions anymore.</p><p>These moments go in cycles, and now, it’s <em>Polygon</em>’s turn.&nbsp;</p><p>In early May, the popular video game (and over time, like many others, entertainment) publication <em>Polygon</em> was acquired by a company of vultures known as Valnet. Nothing good comes from Valnet. Nothing good was going to come by Valnet buying <em>Polygon</em>. Naturally, Valnet’s first move as <em>Polygon</em>’s owner <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/polygon-sale-valnet/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was to enact mass layoffs</u></a>. <em>Polygon</em> hasn’t been shut down, but it’s a fundamentally different place.</p><p>The thing about working at a big company is you often become more than colleagues with the people you work with but <em>friends</em>, folks you share interests and values with. It’s why we continued <em>Waypoint</em> as <em>Remap</em>, and why some from <em>Polygon</em> are headed down a similar path.</p><p>Just recently, former <em>Polygon</em> EIC Chris Plante launched (to much personal jealousy, as it’s long been an idea I’ve had, as well) <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an <em>NPR</em>-style podcast called <em>Post Games</em>.</u></a> But today, I’m chatting with the folks behind another spin-off, and it’s an idea I haven’t seen tried before.</p><p>Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin were, until recently, guides producers at <em>Polygon</em>. For years now, guides have been the financial underbelly of many websites, a mashup of tasty SEO bait that search engines like Google love <em>and</em> beloved by people who just want to know how to find that weird collectible in a game that they’ve spent an hour looking for.</p><p>Now, Gilliam and Parkin are launching<em> Big Friendly.Guide</em>, a publication <em>focused</em> on guides and trying to foster a community <em>around</em> guides. </p><p>Can it work? That’s what I decided to ask Gilliam.</p><p>Before we get to that conversation, though, here’s how to find and support <em>Big Friendly.Guide</em>, which obviously I'd recommend you do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/bigfriendlyguide?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Patreon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Website</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SYGY9ZEMZ5LBN&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>PayPal Donation</u></a></li><li><a href="http://ko-fi.com/bigfriendlyguide?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ko-fi Donation</u></a></li></ul><p>Now, onto the interview.</p><p><em>The conversation below has been lightly edited.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@gpthree?ref=remapradio.com"><span>George Pagan III</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: Talk me through that final day at <em>Polygon</em>. When did you realize things were going wrong, and when did you realize it was one of the worst case scenarios?</strong></p><p>Ryan Gilliam: I actually found out that the website was being sold first, through my other Union co-workers. I was scrolling through our Union Slack when I saw everyone saying their jobs were eliminated. Then I saw people from my team saying they were eliminated. And then looked at my DMs to see Jeff—my co-founder of <em>BigFriendly.Guide</em>, who was also a Guides Producer— telling me to check my email. And that's where I saw that I was also being eliminated. I was in the middle of getting footage for a Destiny guide I was about to write that morning.</p><p>The second I saw the sale, I was worried, because we had fought so long and hard for our Union contract, and I couldn't imagine a <em>Polygon</em> without it. And then the dread of seeing that it didn't matter ... it hit twice for me. The industry sucks, and I've survived more layoffs than I can count—we were up to like two a year there for a while—but <em>Polygon</em> was usually safe. And then inside that bubble, in guides, I felt as safe as possible. In all the bad ways I saw it going down, this wasn't even on the radar for me. It was shocking.</p><p><strong>Remap: I remember what it felt like when the <em>VICE</em> layoff happened: ah, well, it finally came for me. I felt numb. There have been so many layoffs at so many places that while it seemed inevitable I’d also get laid off, all that mental preparation made it difficult to process the reality of it. Where was your head at? Was there a moment that it all sunk in?</strong></p><p>Gilliam: I finally felt pretty safe. After a long, long time of worrying about making myself essential and all that, I had developed skills with the guides team that made me valuable. And I saw how important the guides engine was to the success of the site. There was no reality for me where <em>Polygon</em> would exist with fewer guides people than we had, as it was already a pretty lean team. And, somehow, we had all missed this possibility of a bloodbath sale. Nobody I talked to was prepared or thought this was how it would go down. We thought, if anything, we'd eventually get cut down to a small staff site and guides would churn in the background.</p><p>I used to say that guides would be like the <em>Polygon</em> cockroach, and that they'd move us to some obscure team on another website before they'd give up traffic for the next Persona, Animal Crossing, or GTA, but didn't exactly nail that one.</p>

Given just 30 minutes’ notice before the news was announced by EA in an internal meeting, the studio had apparently just recently successfully passed one of its development milestones and was working toward a vertical slice that would show a chunk of the game in action. </p><p>The story reportedly revolved around playing as T’Challa, Killmonger, or Shuri as each vied for the mantle of Black Panther which would grant them superhuman powers. The game would also feature fights with the shapeshifting Skrull showcased in Marvel’s popular <em>Secret Invasion</em> comic-book crossover event. The gameplay was also aiming to incorporate elements of the Nemesis system from <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> such that enemies might remember past encounters with the player and relationships with aspiring Black Panther rivals might evolve. </p><p>It appears the most likely reason EA may have decided to walk away from the project was the lack of progress after several years of prototyping, even as some of those laid off in Cliffhanger Games’ closure had only just arrived at the studio earlier this year as it scaled up its development capabilities.

Some theorized that Activision did this on purpose to help prevent people from quitting lobbies if they noticed they were going up against a group of high-level players. But it turns out this was only a bug.</p><p>Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1928497479617597649" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates account</a> confirmed that the developer is investigating a bug that is causing player levels and level icons to fail to appear in lobbies. "Thank you for your reports! We are actively investigating this issue," Activision said on the game's <a href="https://trello.com/c/uAEvrBoF" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trello board.</a></p><p>Some of the other known issues for Black Ops 6 multiplayer include theater mode being temporarily disabled due to an issue loading replays, lobbies showing the wrong platform icon next to a player's name, and the Winner's Circle failing to appear in some cases on Stakeout. Another known issue is that players who call in a Dreadnought may get stuck in a state where they're unable to crouch or slide.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-4-all-the-new-black-ops-6-multiplayer-maps-including-fan-favorite-remaster/2900-6609/" data-ref-id="2900-6609">new maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/" data-ref-id="2900-6617">guns</a> in the Season 4 update, along with our breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">what's in the new battle pass.</a> The Zombies mode, meanwhile, gets a big update with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-grief-mode-explained/1100-6531917/" data-ref-id="1100-6531917">introduction of Grief mode.</a> There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-open-the-overlook-safe-room-in-call-of-duty-warzone/1100-6531953/" data-ref-id="1100-6531953">numerous new updates for Warzone, too.</a></p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-infamous-riot-shield-returns-in-black-ops-6-but-not-how-you-think/1100-6531923/" data-ref-id="1100-6531923">Call of Duty's infamous riot shield has debuted in Black Ops 6 as a finishing move. </a> There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick / Ballerina crossover store bundle coming soon.</a></p><p>If you're keen to try Black Ops 6's new Season 4 content, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-free-on-xbox-this-weekend-for-season-4-launch/2900-6626/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6626">multiplayer is free right now for Xbox users. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ZeniMax Workers United union, representing more than 300 quality assurance developers working at ZeniMax Media under Microsoft, has reached a tentative deal after two years of negotiating.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the Communications Workers of America (CWA) calls it a "<em>historic</em>" agreement. The ZeniMax Workers United-CWA is the first union formed after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">Microsoft agreed</a> to take a neutral stance on its employees' unionizing when it was trying to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, to have a deal, even a tentative one, in place.</p>
<p>This deal also comes almost two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted to authorize strike powers</a> for its negotiating committee. When the ZWU-CWA voted to authorize strike powers, representatives of the union voiced their displeasure with Microsoft dragging its feet at the bargaining table, with union member Zachary Armstrong saying "<em>None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is</em>."</p>
<p>The ZWU-CWA did just that and, according to the press release, negotiated a tentative deal that includes "<em>substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers.</em> " It also includes "<em>protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change,</em>" said ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and senior QA tester Page Branson. "<em>Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn't a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after</em>."</p>
<p>Fellow ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and QA tester Jessee Leese added, "<em>Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We're the ones who make these games, and we'll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment</em>."</p>
<p>Now that a tentative deal has been reached, it is expected to be ratified by June 20, according to the ZWU-CWA. Once that's done, it'll officially be the beginning of a new era for QA workers at ZeniMax. After that, the other unions that have formed under Microsoft since it signed a union neutrality agreement that do not have a deal in place are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA</a>, <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild-CWA</a>.</p>

It is the first contract agreement at Microsoft since the concerted effort to unionize the video game industry began roughly four years ago.</p><p>“This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after,” said Page Branson, a senior QA tester at ZeniMax, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">in the press release announcing the agreement</a>. A ratification vote for the contract will take place in late June.</p><p>The union, organized by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), was formed in 2023 and was voluntarily recognized by Microsoft as a part of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/6/23543005/microsoft-washington-post-ad-cwa-unions">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a>. In the two years since, the union and Microsoft engaged in contract negotiations that precipitated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">a one-day strike</a> to protest return to office and outsourcing policies and, in April, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">strike authorization vote</a>.</p><p>The contract details offer up a glimpse of what workers across the industry are fighting for and what they can win. According to CWA’s press release, the contract guarantees wage increases — a big deal considering QA workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in the industry. The contract will also include protections against arbitrary dismissal, as well as crediting guidelines — another big deal, as there are numerous ways a person who worked on a video game <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129">can get left off its credits</a>. </p><p>While the industry’s organization efforts are ongoing, there’s been a surge in activity over the last four years. Workers at Raven Software, which was then a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its acquisition by Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized the first video game union at a AAA publisher in 2022</a>. That win kicked off a series of other high-profile unionization efforts across the industry but concentrated primarily within Microsoft — ostensibly to take advantage of the labor neutrality agreement that states that Microsoft will voluntarily recognize union efforts within the company. With ZeniMax workers finally winning a contract agreement at Microsoft, the industry has another first — one that will set a precedent for future negotiations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
