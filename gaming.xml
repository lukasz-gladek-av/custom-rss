        <p>Will still have procgen, but also a more "structured" campaign</p>

            <p>Baroque wilderness-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">described the launch early access version</a> as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update. </p><!--more-->
<p>In particular, I like the sound of the new "handcrafted" or "Storied realms", which sideline the procgen in order to make each of the game's dimensions "feel more unique and differentiated". They'll form part of a revised and more "structured" story campaign which "takes you across previously unexplored Realms from the corrupted woods of Sylvan's Cradle, to the gravity-torn desert of Welkin's Reach, and beyond".</p>
<p>Here's the skinny from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4347747997086214402">the Steam post in question</a> - it's the second of two blogs about Realms Rebuilt. "The Storied Realms are handcrafted Realms set within the existing biomes, each designed with its own theme, aesthetic, and challenges," the developers explain. "Storied Realms will be introduced as part of a new campaign that will arrive with the next update. As you progress through the main questline, you'll unlock unique Realm Cards - each leading to a new Storied Realm to discover and explore."</p>
<p>To access these Storied Realms, you'll set forth from a new Abeyance hub realm that houses a mystical Crossways - aka, a collection of ancient portals. The Abeyance Realm also contains locations where you can unlock tools and recipes, including new additions such as the bow and arrow.</p>
<p>It's a "big step forward" for Nightingale, the developers say, not least because it will apparently increase "the speed the studio team can create new biome and Realm content". Nightingale's existing, looser survival game format will persist in some form, however. "While Storied Realms become the defacto worlds for mainline quests, procedurally-generated Realms will still play an important part in your journey as a Realmwalker," the post continues. When not exploring a Storied Realm, you can still use the old Realm Cards to open portals to (read: set the parameters for) procgen Realms, which harbour resources and challenges.</p>
<p>Realms Rebuilt should go live this summer. There's a lot more to it: a new progression system, a Regency tileset for the people who wish Jane Austen novels had more pickaxes in them, increased structure limits due to memory optimisations, and assorted new gaspunk gadgetry. There's also a catch: you'll need to start a new character to sample the additions, though you'll be able to save your existing Respite Realms and any structures they contain to visit in offline mode. You can read more in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4347747997066982653">the first blog post</a>. Will it be a Final Fantasy 14-style turnaround? I'm not sure there's quite enough excitement for Nightingale as a concept, but you never know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The conversation between Rhodes and Orton meandered through topics both heavy and lighthearted, with a tangent into the later’s ongoing gaming hobby. “I almost don’t even want to say,” Orton began. “I’m at like, now, keep in mind this game came out...I was out with spinal fusion surgery so I had a lot of time on my hands. I’ve got like six hundred hours on the game.”</p><p>That last part was delivered almost as a whisper with both hands clasped over his face. “I love that game,” he continued. “DLC just came out.” Real heads will remember that Orton previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wwe-randy-orton-elden-ring-runes-pay-level-up-difficult-1850900520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-randy-orton-elden-ring-runes-pay-level-up-difficult-1850900520">paid someone $1,000</a></span> for a bunch of easy runes to level up his Tarnished. </p><p>Rhodes then shared a confession of his own: that he hasn’t been keeping up with the latest frenzy of excitement around <em>Elden Ring</em> and its recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a></span>. While far from the most gut-wrenching thing the two talked about, it was the most immediately relatable for anyone who’s ever been left behind by their gamer pal.</p><p>“Here’s how far things have come,” Rhodes said. “You asked me something about <em>Elden Ring </em>the other day. I didn’t lie to your face I just kind of went ‘yea...’ You mentioned you were playing and I’m like, ‘eh...I’m not really...’ you know like I didn’t know?” Instead of ragging on him, Orton came to his defense.</p><p>“Dude, you’re killing it and you don’t got the time, I understand why,” he responded. “I would love to chop it up about some <em>Elden Ring </em>with ya, trust me, I wish you were a fellow tarnished, but you’re not.” <br></p><p>Real friends accept one another no matter what, even if they don’t play <em>Elden Ring</em>. Go watch the whole interview. It’s great.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its triumphant boss battles and fast-paced combat make up for the stale moments in between, where bland level design and a scarcity of enemies will have you clamoring for the next face-off with a deadly Yaoguai. I appreciate that it's not just another souls-like in what is now a crowded genre, and the choice to go for a boss gauntlet is unexpected and, honestly, quite refreshing. It's disappointing that it falters outside of its cinematic clashes against mighty beasts, but designing this many rousing boss battles while avoiding a sense of fatigue is no mean feat and deserves praise." -- <em>Richard Wakeling</em> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Full review</a>]</p><h2>PC Gamer -- 87/100</h2><p>"Wukong is one of the most joyful action RPGs I've played simply for how lovingly it treats its world and characters and, by extension, how much it clearly wants me to love them too.

Video gaming's premier horn honker, Trombone Champ, is bringing its comedic rhythm-tooting to virtual reality helmets - meaning PC, PlayStation VR 2, and Meta Quest players might want to pucker up in preparation for a vigorous tromboning session this autumn.
</p>
<p>
Trombone Champ: Unflattened, as the new VR version of the 2022 rhythm-action sensation is known, is one of the first official VR adaptations from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-flat2vr-studio-launches-dedicated-to-vr-experiences-of-flatscreen-games">Flat2VR Studios</a> - the developer comprising of modders behind unofficial VR versions of games like Half-Life 2 and Doom.
</p>
<p>
Created in conjunction with original Trombone Champ developer Holy Wow Studios, Trombone Champ: Unflattened is set to feature more than 50 songs across its single-player campaign, with tracks including Ode to Joy, Sakura Sakura, God Save the King, and more.

<p>
It also features mixed reality support, additional (and customisable) trombones for parp-fiends to unlock, cards to collect, and a range of animated 3D environments to stand in while players honk to their heart's content - such as the opulent concert hall featured in Trombone Champ: Unflattened's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eolsfo_9yIo">announcement trailer</a> above.
</p>
<p>
Trombone Champ: Unflattened doesn't have an exact release date yet, but it'll be causing a racket on Steam VR, PSVR2, and Meta Quest this autumn. And if you haven't yet familiarised yourself with the original Trombone Champ yet, I think Eurogamer contributor Liv Ngan said it best when she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2022-trombone-champ-was-the-best-way-to-experience-failure-and-fun-together">wrote</a>, "It's safe to say that 2022 has been another weird year for us all."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gardens-in-partnership-with-pragma-for-online-multiplayer-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gardens is a <a href="https://gardens.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputable games studio</a> with a background in games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-now-live/">Diablo IV</a>, Skyrim, Journey, Firewatch, and many more across the team's resumes. Gardens has teamed up with Pragma, the backend game engine that built platforms for some of the biggest live-service games, to get the best online multiplayer support possible for their newest game. These games include League of Legends, Destiny 2, and Plants vs Zombies 2.</p>
<p>By teaming up with Pragma, they can continue developing their unannounced project without worrying about technical limitations. "It has been really great working with our team of game designers to get all of their ideas and come back with implementations. And I am much more flexible and can accommodate their unique requests with Pragma because they gave me an extensible system that lets me not give just a one-size-fits-all answer," said Serge Knystautas, Head of Engineeering at Gardens Interactive.</p>
<p>By teaming up with Pragma, Gardens now has a platform they can extend without building the entire engine from scratch or investing too many resources into maintaining it. This is because the Pragma Backend Game Engine gives the developers a single backend solution that stays consistent and has all the basic tools and needs for an online live service game. Not only this, but Pragma allows Gardens to customize the tools to their liking so that they can be as basic or as sophisticated as they want.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Gardens' upcoming project, as it doesn't have a name yet. However, it is said to build on the special ways members of the team have designed shared online experiences in the past by allowing players to cross paths and join each other's journeys by shape-shifting and exploring fantasy wilds.</p>
<p>It is said that the company is edging closer to revealing the game title and giving the interested audience more information about what to expect from the upcoming project. Still, at the moment, the information is minimal.</p>
<p>We know that some people working on this project worked on games such as Sky: Children of the Light and Journey, both of which utilize live-service online gameplay uniquely compared to other live-service games.</p>
<p>Gardens was founded in 2021 by Chriss Bell, Lexie Dostal, and Stephen Bell, and the team has grown exponentially since its opening. They had independent backer funding, raising $4.5 million in July 2021 in a Seed round led by Transcend Fund. Additionally, they raised $31.1 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Krafton.</p>

            <p>
There you are, rambling through the woods of Interactive Entertainment with an empty pack and a spring in your step. Here I am, lying in wait behind a tree. Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition">Baldur's Gate</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader</a> - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 
</p>
<p>
Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The eight-game deluge in question is <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/beamdog-owlcat-rpg-masters">the latest Humble Bundle</a>, which is made up of RPGs and RPG remasters from Owlcat and Beamdog. The most expensive iteration of the bundle earns you Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (and its season passes), Pathfinder: Kingmaker Enhanced Plus edition (and its season pass), Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition: Complete Adventures, Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate 1 Enhanced Edition, Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition, and Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. That's in addition to some DLC and a discount voucher for Beamdog's Mythforce.
</p>
<p>
If the idea of buying all of those at once makes your ears catch fire and spin like Roman Candles, I guess you could just spend three bob for Planescape and Icewind Dale. Or around a fiver for both of those plus the two Baldur's Gates and Pathfinder: Kingmaker. I am a forgiving man.</p>
<p>You could also hold off purchasing till next week, and while away the weekend playing the aforesaid artgame you're being so <em>precious</em> about - the latest Humble Bundle runs for 19 more days, though as always, the price will change over time. Which artgame is this, by the way? I personally don't have much time for massive RPGs nowadays, though I'm always tempted when I see them going for a song. Honestly, this "ambushing you in the woods" thing was actually a cry for help. Please, please come back. Recommend me a smaller game I can play instead of buying that bundle. I'm begging you.

It’s the dominating thought of my hours spent sampling the sequel’s new maps, weapons, loadouts, movement, abilities, and more. Despite the fact that it literally chugged on my PC (my own setup’s inadequacy, not the game’s), everything about it was quick. I barely had time to consider my loadout before I was brusquely pushed into the match. Once the action began, everything became a bit of a blur before coming to an abrupt stop mere moments later. Bullets flew, people spilled out of portals, and within about two minutes, the first round was over before I could even make sense of the changes <em>Splitgate 2 </em>was making to the gameplay I’d loved in the original.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196766" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Do I Suck At FF7 Rebirth's Piano Mini-Game?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="196766,196163,195358" data-current="196766"><div><p>Why Do I Suck At FF7 Rebirth's Piano Mini-Game?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22321.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>From everything that Ian Proulx, the game’s creative director, shared in our short briefing prior to the preview, he and the team at 1047 certainly seemed like they wanted to amp things up like this. In that regard, I’d consider <em>Splitgate 2 </em>a pretty immediate success. The <em>Splitgate</em> brand of rapid-fire skirmishes and tactical portal placement is as polished as it’s ever been. The original game always felt good enough, but the sequel feels <em>tight</em>. There’s just a part of me that worries that, in scaling everything up, it may have lost a little bit of what made the original such a knockout.<br></p><p><em>Splitgate </em>was touted as the meeting between <em>Halo </em>and <em>Portal</em>, two widely beloved and entirely different series of first-person games. But something they do have in common was this kind of space that either gave you to find your footing, whether it be in an online deathmatch or in a room you’re inspecting for puzzle solutions. <em>Halo </em>matches aren’t drawn out, but they also aren’t over in the blink of an eye, and <em>Portal </em>doesn’t enforce any time constraints, giving you all the time you need to solve its conundrums. Both were great at providing this sandbox for possibility and experimentation, and <em>Splitgate </em>did a decent job of channeling that spirit. That no longer feels like the case with <em>Splitgate 2</em>.</p><p>The original game wasn’t slow, but it felt methodical at times. Maps weren’t sprawls, but they had nooks and crannies that lent themselves to different kinds of encounters. It paid off to be surgical rather than gung-ho. <em>Splitgate </em>may have been a little floaty, but that was a fun alternative to <em>Call of Duty</em>’s emphasis on twitchy movement. <em>Splitgate 2</em> abandons some of these tenets and falls in line with a number of ongoing trends in similar games, bucking what made the original so unique at the time in favor of some bid at even wider adoption. </p><p>I didn’t <em>love </em>how <em>Splitgate 2 </em>seems to forget what made the original game work for me. Team Deathmatch, as an example, used to be one extensive round in which the first team to 50 kills won. Now, <em>Splitgate 2 </em>has split it into several rounds with a maximum of 15 kills, and the first team to 3 wins takes the whole match. That meant that matches were over lightning fast. Before I could even get accustomed to the weapon I was using or the unique abilities of my loadout and class, the match was done.</p><p>Additionally, there’s a death mechanic that feels especially punitive. The more you die, which happens quite fast in <em>Splitgate 2</em>, the more time gets added to your respawn timer. The more I fumbled, the more I was denied the time and space to sort myself out in-game and establish a flow.</p><p>The other mode available in the preview, Hotzone, is similarly quick. A king-of-the-hill type mode, Hotzone’s conceit is that progression on the objective is shared between both teams. That means that you could come within a second of capturing, but if the enemy team takes you out and jumps on the point, they can claim it for themselves after only standing on it for a second. The idea appears to be to add some kind of pressure to act impulsively, but without any real way to combat the possibility of a sudden takeover, it just appears like a mean-spirited mechanic that can be manipulated to force early wins with little contention. </p><p>To aid things along, a lot of smaller aspects of <em>Splitgate </em>have been fine-tuned in the sequel to facilitate this faster and more aggressive pace. There is now a slide function, and your jetpack feels more propulsive than before, which should help you cover more ground. Portals are now tied to a single button, and the game has a system built to essentially guess which portal you meant to place down in order to eliminate some of the thinking that’d previously go into such a process. Portals can also be placed on top of enemies’ portals now, encouraging you to be bold and take the flank route more often.</p><p>On some level, these changes are absolutely welcome as quality-of-life features that just reduce the amount of inputs necessary to do anything. When taken into account among the wider changes to the game, though, such as the introduction of factions—classes with abilities like a wall-hack scan, a burst of speed, or a deployable shield—I worry that <em>Splitgate 2 </em>may be an entirely different game.</p><p>I love a good competitive shooter, but I think what a lot of people adored about <em>Splitgate</em> was how light-hearted and casual it <em>could</em> feel, with room for ventures into the more hardcore modes and lobbies if desired. Maybe <em>Splitgate 2 </em>will make a similar distinction, but from what was on offer for me, it seemed to lean entirely into the latter, abandoning a large audience that just wants something fun to pick up and play. I don’t like feeling that I have to be locked in every time I play a game, but that’s what playing <em>Splitgate 2 </em>for an afternoon felt like.</p><p>Which isn’t to say the game’s poor or bad, but that it feels like <em>Splitgate 2 </em>lost itself in this transformation. If this is the final form that 1047 hoped for out of the original <em>Splitgate</em>, well, then maybe that first game was a bit of a fluke. If you want another movement-heavy and highly competitive shooter with a unique central premise, <em>Splitgate 2 </em>certainly fits the bill. If you were drawn to the casual playfulness of the original title and expected the sequel to double down on that, though, you may be in for disappointment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Movie</em>.” But how are 4DX screenings created and programmed? And how did this exhilarating way to watch movies come to be? I sat down with Paul Kim, senior vice president of content and production at CJ 4DPLEX, a Seoul-based cinema tech company pioneering the medium, to find out more about the technology and the impressive team behind it. </p><h2 id="h3422"><a id=""></a><strong>The rise of 4DX</strong></h2><p>“Movies are a huge part of the entertainment culture in Korea,” Kim says over video call. “We had so many big movie theaters that ran 24 hours a day, because people go to see them at four in the morning. And any sort of new technology, a new way to view movies, [the Korean audience is] always leading into it. 4DX just made a lot of sense.” </p><p>The first 4DX movie was 2009’s largely forgotten <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, shown at the CGV Sangam theater in Seoul, South Korea. But the popularity of the medium skyrocketed after <em>Avatar </em>debuted in the same theater several months later—since then, the 4DX team has coded “close to 80 films a year,” according to Kim. Part of the allure of a 4DX viewing (which Kim admits “isn’t for everyone”) is the immersiveness, but he suggests there’s something else that makes it extra-special.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="346b6659113a094b0ef7b2daa235ba70" data-recommend-id="image://346b6659113a094b0ef7b2daa235ba70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A picture of the 4DX Theater in Regal Times Square.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“You’ll sit down and there’s always a good amount of people who have never seen a film in 4DX, and the first thing or shake happens and you just hear giggles throughout the entire theater, and that’s almost cathartic, right?” He continues, “That’s the whole point, you’re in a movie theater, you’re there to enjoy yourself, and everyone’s looking around saying ‘is it okay for me to laugh, is it okay for me to enjoy it that much?’ But everyone’s doing that, and it becomes this communal thing.”<br></p><p>There are currently 678 4DX theaters spanning 65 countries, and though America didn’t get its first one until 2014, it currently has the biggest one in the world: Regal Times Square, which boasts nearly 300 seats (an impressive feat considering how large 4DX chairs have to be). I tell Kim this is where I saw <em>Twisters</em>. “It’s massive. Unheard of,” he says, smiling. </p><h2 id="h3423"><a id=""></a><strong>How 4DX movie screenings are made</strong></h2><p>There’s something I am desperate to understand about 4DX, something that’s been nagging me since I walked out of that theater blissfully dazed: how the hell the movies are programmed. It would certainly seem like such a massive, global corporation would utilize the highest-end tech to streamline and speed up the process of translating a film to the 4DX format, but Kim assures me it’s far more bespoke than that. </p><p>“There’s a misconception that this is an automated process of sorts. It’s not. We have a full team of artists, or editors as we like to call them, that work on every 4DX film,” Kim explains. “We get the final cut of the film, or even sometimes a work-in-progress version, weeks before the initial release. Our editors will then sit down in front of their computers, we have software that works with our equipment, and they will go scene-by-scene. At times, when there’s a lot of action like in <em>Twisters</em>, they’ll go frame-by-frame if necessary to ensure that every little bump of the truck, every lightning strike, matches and syncs properly. I have to give credit to the team because it is such a creative process, it’s not just something that happens, it takes a lot of time and work and labor and effort.”</p><figure id="" data-id="2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-recommend-id="image://2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos on the official Twisters 4DX poster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos on the official Twisters 4DX poster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Pictures / CJ 4DPLEX</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-recommend-id="image://2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos on the official Twisters 4DX poster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kim outlines the opening <em>Twisters</em> sequence, and how the team designed the 4DX experience for it. “There’s a calm before the storm where you’re introduced to the characters in their trucks. And as the tornado started to build up, we had to think about, ‘well, who’s the character right now that we want to emphasize? Is that the truck driving away from the tornado or the tornado [itself]?’ And at a certain point we decided, ‘okay, the truck we’re going to de-emphasize, because right now it’s all about the tornado,’,” he explains. “It’s just about which character we want to highlight—and by character, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a human character.”<br></p><p>It takes the 4DX editors about two weeks to program the experience for a two-hour film. “On average, you have two teams working on this,” Kim says. “One team works specifically on the chairs, the motion of them and the vibrations. The other team then layers on top the effects, the water, the air, the strobe lights, the fog, all of that. And then there is an art director, or as we call them, the lead producer. And they watch all of that, like a conductor of an orchestra, and make sure all of the pieces work together cohesively and are additive to the story.” </p><p>The 4DX team then brings in a producer on the film to see the final cut and offer suggestions. Kim says this part of the process is always incredibly fruitful, like with <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, which released earlier this year. “There’s a sequence where there’s a device right, a thumper to call the sandworms. And when there’s a close-up of the thumper, we added a vibration in the seats. But when it’s away and you don’t see it, we stopped that vibration because it was no longer on-screen. One of the <em>Dune </em>editors came in and said, ‘you know what would be really cool? Even if it’s not on screen, just keep it thumping, keep the vibration going…it’s in the background, you know it’s happening, there’s a sandworm, you know it’s coming, but it gives that little extra bit of anticipation and suspense.’ That was the coolest idea ever.”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8c47a715795b4d87548abd43f81f5637" data-recommend-id="image://8c47a715795b4d87548abd43f81f5637" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Multiple sandworms streak towards people running on the sand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Multiple sandworms streak towards people running on the sand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

She’s been coding or editing 4DX films for 15 years, she’s done over 315 by herself, she knows this thing inside and out,” he says. “And she was telling me that she bought a gyroscope and accelerometer for <em>Godzilla Minus One</em>, a lot of which takes place on boats or ships. She rented a boat and went out with the gyroscope to see how much it would sway, and she went go-kart racing with the accelerometer to see how much force is applied when turning tight curves. It’s not just, ‘okay it looks like it’s turning left, so let’s make the chairs turn left.’ It’s the nuance, there’s a real sense of genuine care that goes into designing 4DX for every film.”<br></p><p>Kim tells me that <em>Twisters </em>in 4DX was a “match made in heaven,” but the team was still pleasantly surprised at the hype. “It just took with audiences, it made sense, as you said, it’s a perfect storm.” But he thinks there’s another new movie that is a must-see in the 4DX: <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. “I highly recommend you see that in 4DX,” he says, grinning mischievously. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-is-a-solid-sequel-but-with-a-big-esports-influence/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Splitgate has always had a special place in my heart since I first played it in mid-2019. It felt familiar and fluid thanks to its Halo-esque gameplay, and its portal mechanics gave something new and exciting to the arena shooter genre. It was simply fun, and after playing for several hours during a recent playtest of Splitgate 2, I can safely say that Splitgate is back with a very strong sequel, but its changes to cater towards Esports may be a turn-off to some.</p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit that Splitgate 2’s initial gameplay reveal was a fairly big eyebrow-raiser for me. Four-on-four matches, factions, abilities, and perks, all while being commentated by esports professionals, instantly told me where the game was heading. It felt like changes were being made for the sake of the esports appeal rather than continuing where Splitgate had left off with pure mayhem and fun, and after my time playing, that initial feeling still looms, despite the game being a ton of fun to play.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a pre-playtest briefing, 1047 Games CEO and founder Ian Proulx told us that Splitgate 2 was the studio’s “game of their dreams,” which had to have the two fundamental parts that made the original game a success: portals and great gunplay. The gunplay is still stellar, and the new sliding mechanic adds to the overall fluidity in movement, creating some feel-good moments as you zip around the map in and out of portals. </p>



<p>Portals have also been tweaked and improved from the first title, from only needing a single button to use both portals to how a teammate’s portals will now move left or right to give your own portal room to spawn. These improvements limit hesitation and make Splitgate 2 similar in chaos to its predecessor despite the matches seeing a reduction in players.</p>



<p>One of the biggest causes for concern I saw from the community was the addition of Factions in Splitgate 2. It was an initial concern for me, too. But after playing, they do work incredibly well. The game has three different factions: Aeros, Meridian, and Sebrask, all of whom have different abilities, weapons, and perks. Thanks to Splitgate’s unique gameplay loop, not one faction screamed out as being better than the other during my time playing, but the new Faction-based system pushes players to play as a team rather than just running solo. </p>



<p>During the playtest, we had two different game modes to choose from: Team Deathmatch and Hotzone, both of which were round-based. Hotzone is a King of the Hill mode where teams have to cap two hills to win the round, and to win the match, teams have to win three rounds. An additional twist with Hotzone is that the hills take 20 seconds of shared capture time, meaning that, in theory, your team can control the hill for 19 seconds but have that point taken away from you if the enemy team captures the last second. This gameplay decision was described to us in a pre-playtest briefing to “encourage teamplay” and to create those “big moments.” It’s arguably a perfect gameplay decision for two full teams that talk to each other. However, for someone playing solo with three teammates without mics, it created immensely frustrating moments.</p>



<p>The round-based system is also incorporated in Team Deathmatch, with the first team reaching 15 kills winning the round, with 3 rounds to win the match. Rounds are so that players can change their faction if needed during a match, which for a mode like Hozone made a lot of sense, but for a mode like Team Deathmatch just sucked all momentum out of play. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, Splitgate 2 is a very solid sequel. It’s built on the strong foundations that the original game left behind, with a prestigious AAA feel, beautiful maps, and some great improvements to gameplay. But after the playtest, I have been pondering whether some of its bigger changes to seemingly chase esports and competitive will be a turnoff to those who loved the original’s simplicity. While I still have the itch to play again, I hope the game offers a more casual playlist on its final release.</p>

<p>In Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag. There's an eerie smiling face drawn on it, much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling man, a killer of urban legend.</p>

<p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">brief glimpse</a> that got horror fans very excited last month, it's now confirmed that Nintendo's mysterious horror game is in fact a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series.</p>
<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will launch on 29th August. If you're unfamiliar with the retro adventure series, this is a Nintendo-developed franchise originally released in the late 1980s. Two games were released, but only in Japan. And there they remained for more than 30 years, until a Nintendo Switch remake of the pair launched worldwide in 2021.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/broken-sword">Broken Sword</a> remaster now has a release date and will be launching on PC and consoles next month, on September 19th, 2024. Titled “<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">Broken Sword – Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>” this is an upgrade of the classic adventure game that first debuted on PlayStation and PC almost three decades ago back in 1996.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Release Date Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfC1TkQSpfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Claiming to be a “substantial enhancement” over the original game, Reforged will tout 4K visuals as well as improvements to artwork, animations, and audio, all in an effort to modernise the hit point and click adventure. Those feeling a bit rusty (or are maybe completely new to the genre) will also benefit from the game’s new “story mode” feature.</p>
<p>This is said to “dynamically balance narrative and gameplay”, which will hopefully stop players from getting bogged down in some of Broken Sword’s more obtuse puzzles, allowing them to easily progress through the story.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Broken Sword Remaster Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compelling Storyline: Dive into a gripping narrative filled with twists, turns, and unexpected revelations. Join George and Nico as they investigate a trail of mysteries that takes them from the bustling streets of Paris to exotic locales around Europe and the Middle East.</li>
<li>Classic Point-and-Click Gameplay: Discover, or rediscover, the joy of classic point-and-click mechanics as you solve puzzles, gather clues, and interact with a colorful cast of characters. Immerse yourself in an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Fully Voice Acted: Lose yourself in the game’s atmosphere with fully-voiced dialogue and engaging performances bringing a cast of wonderful, colorful characters to life.</li>
<li>Challenging Puzzles: Put your intellect to the test with thought-provoking puzzles that require observation, deduction, and creativity to solve. From deciphering codes to manipulating objects, every challenge is a step closer to uncovering the arcane secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Broken Sword – Shadow of the Templars: Reforged will be available digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>The game, which is the first new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series in several decades (if you don't count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-and-mages-working-on-famicom-detective-club-remakes">the 2021 remakes</a>, that is), is due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-emio-famicom-detective-club">arrive on August 29th</a>, and you're getting the chance to try it out ahead of that date.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1824461366293418168" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on Nintendo's X (formerly Twitter) feed, the&nbsp;<em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>demo will arrive on August 19th at 6pm Pacific, which means you'll have to wait until the wee small hours of the following day if you're in Europe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-demo-dialogue.jpg?itok=n6Kb2Ovz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-demo-dialogue.jpg?itok=oG-94VVX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>is getting a demo soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The demo will feature the early chapters of the game, and following its initial release, more chapters will be added on August 22nd and August 27th (or August 23rd and August 28th, depending on where in the world you are).</p>
<p>Once you've played through the prologue and the first three chapters, all of which will be included in the demo, you'll then be able to transfer your progress across to the full game if you decide to buy it.</p>
<p>Being able to play through the first three chapters of a detective adventure game in their entirety is a pretty solid way to figure out whether the full game is for you, so credit to Nintendo for a pretty generous demo. You can check out the new "case briefing" trailer for&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p><em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>is a detective adventure game in which you must investigate a spate of crimes based on the fictional urban legend of the Smiling Man, a serial killer who grants his victims a "permanent smile".</p>
<p>The game is due to launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch on August 29th. You can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order it right here</a> if you're interested.</p>

Just a reminder, not a real person,” Merced said. “And so Kaitlyn had to be extra secured by security when it came to the filming of this.”</p><p>There’s no evidence that Dever other members of the cast received any direct threats, but the makers of the HBO adaptation’s second season were apparently worried enough about possible interruptions or worse to take preemptive measures to head off any danger. That might sound ridiculous, but Abby has been a unique lightning rod for unhinged outrage within some corners of gaming culture.</p><p>To understand why we’ll have to share a few spoilers from <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A major plot development turns <em>The Last of Us 2</em> somewhat on its head, and was so controversial when it was first discovered that some players started harassing the studio behind the game, Naughty Dog, before it was even out. While the first game starred Joel, (played by Pedro Pascal in the show), the gritty, hardened male avatar is killed early on by Abby in the sequel, and not without good reason. The shocking death plunges Ellie into her own bloody quest for revenge, leading the series into ever darker and more inhumane places. </p><p>When <em>some</em> fans of the first game found this out, they began sending death threats to the actors and developers. Joel’s death was treated by them as a betrayal, despite it being the story director Neil Druckmann and others wanted to tell. Things got so bad that the studio had to address the hate campaign publicly.</p><p> “You can love or hate the game and share your thoughts about it,” Druckmann <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1279841603843051520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1279841603843051520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Twitter at the time</a></span>. “Unfortunately too many of the messages I’ve been getting are vile, hateful, &amp; violent.” He shared screenshots of messages containing homophobic, transphobic, antisemitic, and other hateful remarks. “Hopefully covid 19 kills your whole toxic feminist studio,” read part of one of the messages. </p><p>Laura Bailey, who played Abby in the game, said the nightmarish episode <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">taught her to keep her distance from the public</a></span>. The outrage campaign included threats against her parents and even her son who was born during the game’s development. Given that history, it’s not surprising the HBO show would take extra precautions to protect the TV version of Abby. </p><p><em>The Last of Us</em> still has a lot of ground to cover in season 2 though, and Druckmann and showrunner Craig Mazin have said the adaptation could run as long as four seasons. It seems plausible, even likely, that the most polarizing developments, assuming they remain in the show, won’t happen for a while yet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/sample-a-multi-part-demo-for-emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-next-week/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced that a demo for Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will arrive for Nintendo Switch next week, albeit in an unusual multi-stage fashion.</p>
<p>Starting on 20th August (19th August in North America), the Emio – The Smiling Man demo will dole out the prologue and first three chapters of the game over the course of eight days. At first only the Prologue and Chapter 1 will be available, followed by Chapter 2 a few days later and finally Chapter 3.</p>


<p>Here’s the dates that everything will be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>August 20th: Prologue and Chapter 1 (demo launch)</li>
<li>August 23rd: Chapter 2</li>
<li>August 28th: Chapter 3</li>
</ul>
<p>New chapters unlock at 6PM PT / 9PM ET / 2AM BST / 3AM CEST / 10AM JST, with the demo needing to be updated in order to access the new content.</p>
<p>The goal, from Nintendo’s perspective, is to build a little bit of communal intrigue for the game, with each chapter sure to end on a cliffhanger or some kind of revelatory bombshell. It’s another atypical marketing move by the publisher, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-has-been-revealed/">which started off with just a creepy teaser trailer for the game</a>.</p>

<p>This all builds up to the full launch of Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club on 29th August. Any progress that you make in the demo will transfer across to the full game, you’ll be glad to hear.</p>
<p>Emio – The Smiling Man is the first completely new Famicom Detective Club game in 27 years, though the series was revived a few years ago with a remake collection of the 1980s Famicom originals for Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>I reviewed Famicom Detective Club back in 2021, saying “It’s wonderful to have the classic Famicom Detective Club games remade with modern artwork and with full Western localisations, but the flow of these visual novel detective stories is distinctly lacking and infuriatingly obtuse at times. Still, we can hope this is a sign that Nintendo is considering a truly modern revival of the Detective Club series in future.”</p>
<p>Guess what? It was a sign!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/what-we-played-kunitsu-gami-dead-rising-deluxe-black-myth-wukong/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For the first time in a good while, I’ve been playing with my PlayStation VR 2, thanks to the renewed excitement of being able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">plug it into a PC and play Half-Life: Alyx for a bit</a>. That’s also come with all the techy nonsense joys of fiddling with setting files to get Star Wars Squadrons to run better, with half the “fun” on PC gaming being just getting to run as well as it possibly can. I’m probably alone in that…</p>
<p>Aside from that, I also got to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-a-breath-of-rotting-flesh-air-in-a-good-way/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, which is a much bigger deal than that name makes it sound.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> was first to check in, and he’s been playing some Gori: Cuddly Carnage for our upcoming review, as well as Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown –&nbsp;The gameplay is fun and I’m enjoying the exploration and combat,” he says, “but the story feels weak.”</p>
<p>It’s been (liquorice) all sorts for <strong>Ade</strong> this week, who’s been enjoying Lego Star Wars and Minecraft with his son, EDF 6 and Diablo IV with his partner, and some Kunitsu-Gami and Skull and Bones when hiding away from human contact.</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> snagged a PlayStation Portal for cheap, but yet to give it a go. I’m trying to convince him that his Steam Deck with an open source remote play app will be just as good, so we’ll see what he thinks if he gives that a try. As for what he’s actually playing, he’s been very tempted to play new and different games, but is sticking to Fallout: New Vegas –&nbsp;“I’m taken aback by just how much I like this game. There’s a definite jankiness and, without mods, some gameplay and visual shortcomings, though the world itself is incredibly immersive. Embarking on one quest usually leads to bumping into an entirely new faction or settlement, though not in a way that feels too overwhelming. I’m some 30 hours in now and have just wrapped the Honest Hearts DLC after accidentally stumbling upon that questline.”</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> had my back on the whole Chiaki4Deck thing, which is why I like him. He’s been playing a suitably quirky mix of Witchspring R, Fortnite, Ace Combat 5, and Ridge Racer 6!</p>
<p><strong>Nick P</strong> is another Kunitsu-Gami acolyte, as it’s become one of his favourite games of the year. He’s also been able to play some of the upcoming Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, which is “SO GOOD!”</p>
<p>Lover of all things card games as he is, <strong>Nic’s</strong> been back at it with the “heckin’ cute” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/mtg-arena-bloomburrow-review-magic-the-gathering/">Bloomburrow</a> expansion for MTG: Arena. Beyond that, he’s been reliving the chaotic point and clicking of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/sam-and-max-the-devils-playhouse-remastered-review/">Sam &amp; Max: The Devil’s Playhouse</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just been Destiny 2 for <strong>Tuffcub</strong> this week, but he’s gradually building up energy to tackle Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, so let’s swiftly move on to <strong>Gamoc</strong>. He made a start on Dustborn for our review, continued playing Rogue Trader and is now about 62 hours in, and finished off Little Hope from The Dark Pictures Anthology –&nbsp;he’s finding the series to be rather inconsistent.</p>

<p>And rounding things out for this week, Jason’s played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, with a review to explain why it’s not quite as good as he was hoping it would be</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13.955134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest expansion for New World is set to release this year, and players can get a glimpse at the action to come by participating in the New World: Aeternum Open Beta. For those who are interested, the Open Beta starts on September 13 and runs through September 16, giving players a couple of days to get some game time in and experience the new content.</p>
<p>The New World: Aeternum Open Beta will be available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a> in North America, South America, Europe, and APAC (Asia-Pacific). The beta also supports cross-play across all platforms, allowing people to team up with friends who may be on different platforms.</p>
<p>For those eager to get stuck into the New World: Aeternum Open Beta, players can pre-load the beta from 9 AM PT / 5 PM BST / 12 PM ET on September 11 across all platforms. Suppose you have some burning questions during or after the New World: Aeternum Open Beta. In that case, there is an FAQ available to read on the <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-gb/game/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World website</a>, which goes into detail to answer any important questions you may have regarding the game.</p>
<p>Not only is the New World: Aeternum Open Beta a great opportunity to see if this is an expansion they want to spend their money on, but those who delve into the beta will also be rewarded for their time and efforts. They can get an exclusive Aeternian Adventure skin and title, which will be available to players once New World: Aeternum is officially released on October 15.</p>
<p>For those wanting to pre-purchase, purchasing the New World: Rise of the Angry Earth expansion on Steam will automatically gain access to New World: Aeternum in a free update. You can purchase it on Steam for $29.99 or $69.98 if you want the Elysian Edition.</p>
<p>However, if you're on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5, you'll instead have to be forking out $59.99 for the New World: Aeternum Standard Edition. Alternatively, if you want to spend a bit more money, you can purchase the New World: Aeternum Deluxe Edition for $79.99, which includes the DLC, a Corrupted Soul Armor Skin, and a Corrupted Bear Mauler Mount for you to ride around in style.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the price difference between those on consoles and those who play the game on PC is astonishing, especially since Rise of the Angry Earth is a PC-specific expansion, with Aeternum being available across all platforms. This continues to disadvantage those who are on consoles by locking them out of a whole expansion's worth of content.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stranded-deep-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stranded-deep-2-announced-as-developer-opens-new-studio-branch.955131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stranded-deep-2-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer North Beach Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 survival-crafting game, as well as a brand new development outfit that's currently working on said sequel.</p>
<p>In a press release, North Beach reveals that it's opened up a new studio branch in Prague, and that it's this studio branch which will be heading up the development of&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, although the game sounds like it's still pretty early on in its development cycle.</p>
<p>Indeed, we don't yet know that much about&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>; we know it exists, and that the Prague North Beach team will be handling it, but beyond that, details regarding the game are relatively scarce.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stranded-deep-2-announced-stranded-deep-whale.jpg?itok=RLY5JkIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stranded-deep-2-announced-stranded-deep-whale.jpg?itok=csjWAZPw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Underwater survival game&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep&nbsp;</em>is getting a sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>The new North Beach Prague team will be headed up by Sam Edwards, who served as one of the original creators of&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep&nbsp;</em>as part of Australian studio Beam Team Games.</p>
<p>As well as creating&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, the Prague team's responsibilities will also include the creation and support of "new games within the survival crafting space", which makes sense given North Beach's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria">pedigree as a developer</a>.</p>
<p>For his part, Edwards says he and Prague general manager&nbsp;Tomáš Pšenička are "super excited" to be working on&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, and that the goal for the game will be to "look to the future of the franchise and explore new horizons".</p>
<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2&nbsp;</em>will be made available "in the future", North Beach says. The studio will have a presence at this year's Gamescom, but it doesn't sound like more info about&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2&nbsp;</em>will be revealed during this month's show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-north-beach-games.jpg?itok=Z49QWiEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-north-beach-games.jpg?itok=1CGC3dZf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>North Beach's other games include&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2&nbsp;</em>turns out to be, we can only hope it'll be a more pleasurable experience than&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em>, of which our reviewer Robert <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-review-even-darkness-must-pass">was not a big fan</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things North Beach.</p>
