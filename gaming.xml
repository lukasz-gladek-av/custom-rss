During the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, the studio showed off more gameplay for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682371/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-xbox-games-showcase-trailer">its action RPG <em>Beast of Incarnation</em></a>, and confirmed that it will be launching in the summer of 2026 on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p>Here’s the overview that aired during the event:</p><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is set in a postapocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, and it’s described as a “one-person one-dog action RPG,” with a world and gameplay designed to evoke the feelings of “warmth, trust, and loneliness.” In practice, it looks a little like a cross between <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, which means lots of cool monster designs and what looks to be very intense combat that blends elements of real-time action and turn-based RPGs. And, yes, it definitely seems like you can pet the dog.</p><p>In development for six years, the game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23716737/game-freak-developer-project-bloom-game">first revealed back in 2023 under the codename Project Bloom</a>, and has since undergone a publishing shift. It was originally under the label Private Division, which was previously part of Take-Two Interactive. But the label has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289932/take-two-private-division-publisher-sale">since been sold off</a> and is now operating under the name Fictions.</p><p>And while Game Freak is best known as the primary developer behind the <em>Pokémon</em> series, the studio has dabbled in outside projects from time to time, though these tend to be smaller-scale titles like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537624/apple-arcade-game-freak-pokemon-pocket-card-jockey-ride-on">Pocket Card Jockey</a></em> or <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/21/9008871/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review-xbox-ps4-pc">Tembo the Badass Elephant</a></em>. <em>Beast of Incarnation</em> represents the studio’s biggest non-<em>Pokémon</em> project to date.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/865588/beast-of-reincarnation-trailer-date-pokemon-game-freak]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1413625</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing: New Horizons got a big 3.0 update earlier this month, which alongside a lot of new content for everyone included a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade with some fancy technological buffs. One of those was the ability to play with up to 12 total people on the same island, up from eight in the original version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds fun, right? Wrong. It's a nightmare. A nightmare once again spawned by Nintendo handling online functionality in the most ridiculous way possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was so foolish and naive a week ago, when I first had the idea to get 12 of us together for an Animal Crossing session. It would be easy, I thought! So easy, I originally didn't even plan on writing anything about it! Let me just call up...11 other people I know who are still playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who also have Nintendo Switch 2s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And somehow we'll manage to find an hour we can all do this, despite everyone being busy adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, harder than I thought, but we did it! Last night, a group of 12 of us all logged on at once with a plan to meet up on my island. We considered using the Game Chat functionality, but decided against it due to lack of compatibility with Bluetooth headsets, the function's friending requirements, and the fact that you can't take screenshots while Game Chat is active. Discord it was, then, apparently still the second-best place for Nintendo Voice Chat (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">after the podcast, of course</a>).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092311-01kfk4k4x1qaac3z7dje12vshc-1769104423045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan was for an hour-long session from 9pm to 10pm last night, but I recalled that the cutscene for people landing on the island was a bit lengthy, and we'd have to watch it 11 times, so I logged on half an hour early to open my island so we could start filtering in. I was hopeful that with improved Nintendo Switch 2 loading times, it might not be so bad. And it's true, the actual loading times were notably faster, though most of the wait for people to land is a combination of said cutscene ("We'll be making a water landing, but that's OK because this is a seaplane.") and everyone saving the game each time, so we didn't really shorten the wait by that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that was to be expected. Here was where the nightmare began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 8:35pm, my friends began trickling in. We managed to get three people in before the entire session crashed, booting out everyone who had showed up so far and shutting my islands gates for me. I reopened at 8:46pm and we started again, this time creating a "queue" in our Discord text chat so everyone didn't try to flood in at once. At 8:58pm, one of my friends got an error that kicked her out alongside one other person, but everyone else stayed, so we brought them back and continued down the line.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092308-01kfk4hw7zj58ec37nepwcgtp8-1769104446457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:19pm, I typed in Discord, "WE DID IT" as person #12 seemingly landed successfully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:21pm, as person #12 strolled in, another error occurred and two other people got kicked out. At this point, my husband (who was playing Ace Attorney next to me) started rolling his eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:24pm, one of the people who had been kicked out tried to rejoin, errored out, and the whole session crashed again. Every single person got booted back to their islands and my gates were closed again, just as we were finally about to taste success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please enjoy this timelapse video, courtesy of our intrepid Wiki writer KBABZ, of 40 minutes of us trying desperately to get everyone onto the island, only for the unthinkable to happen right at the very end:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was undaunted. By golly, we got all these people together, we were going to hit each other with nets and drop recipe cards for each other! We started again from the top. This time I forbade everyone from doing anything once they landed aside from standing still in a line next to the airport. No menuing. No talking to villagers. Nothing. Folks started coming back in at 9:27pm. At 9:37pm, the fourth person to join crashed the island again. At 9:39pm, almost 40 minutes after our planned start time, we began yet again. Everyone posted cat pics in the Discord channel for emotional support.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092312-01kfk4kh4kd89e5tn3ez40q8zk-1769104468431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This time worked. Finally, at 10:05pm, after multiple crashes and false starts, we had 12 people on my Animal Crossing island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092315-01kfk4mbwv3js65mw1jeptph91-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm happy to report that after the <em>90 minute ordeal</em> that was getting 12 people onto one island, online play actually worked great. We all exchanged gifts, took a pic in the Town Square, explored the island, and got coffee at Brewster's. People wrote on my bulletin board and sent me letters. Some borrowed my Wario costume from the hotel. A couple people decided to play pranks, burying junk and trapping my villagers with holes. It was genuinely a pretty great time. It just, you know, took way too dang long to set up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092320-01kfk4pdtcz6we4gfvt9j2an9t-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's baffling to me that Nintendo's infrastructure for Animal Crossing is still set up this way. Yes, the island landing cutscene is very cute, and I do think the sea plane line is pretty funny. But why on earth do we need to sit through it 11 times, with everyone who's not traveling collectively watching a mostly-blank airport-themed loading screen? Why does everything on my island need to completely freeze and exit menus so someone can come in? Why does Group Stretching require me to be Best Friends with everyone on my island? How much worse would all this have been if we had used Game Chat? Mario Kart World doesn't have this problem!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092323-01kfk4q36ntgqn62xk8tmvvetf-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The best explanation I can think of is that Nintendo genuinely didn't intend for anyone to use this feature in the first place. Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update is fun, sure, but it's not creating the same massive surge in interest that existed in 2020 when we were all locked at home and had nothing better to do than ponder whatever it is that Dodos do. You're unlikely to ever need to collect 11 friends and drag them to your island all at once. Heck, given how hard this was to schedule, I'll be lucky to get four one of these weekends.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092325-01kfk4qm2h3qkextzwa2w2j5v7-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still very fun to play with friends, but it's still a massive pain in the butt to actually set up the circumstances for that play to be possible. Next time I'll just get everyone together for Jackbox.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092326-01kfk4qyknppc2dj0vk9fw215x-1769104546250.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We're still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">checking out the big 3.0 update</a> and all the fun new stuff that's been added.

            <guid>1413622</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Game Freak's upcoming action game Beast of Reincarnation reemerged at the Xbox Developer Direct, with a lengthy segment showing off traversal, combat, its cast of characters, some dang good music, and more. Also, great news, it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-gets-new-look-at-actionrpg-hybrid-combat-and-a-summer-release-window">apparently out this summer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is a fascinating new game, and an anomaly in Game Freak's portfolio. Game Freak is, of course, best-known for developing Pokemon, a series that's grown in scope as it's transitioned to home console releases but has also seen notable declines in performance and visual quality. But Game Freak has also been increasing its other independent endeavors in recent years, with games such as HarmoKnight, Tembo the Badass Elephant, and Pocket Card Jockey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But aside from Pokemon all of those have been fairly small-scale endeavors. Though we haven't gotten our hands on Beast of Reincarnation yet, this <em>looks</em> far more ambitious. It's a full-on action game, for one, with what seems to be pretty complex and multi-layered combat and movement. It's also, if the trailers are any indication, really pretty, and a departure from Game Freak's historically more cartoony style. That's led to plenty of questions as to what led Game Freak to make something like this in the first place, and whether or not the studio can pull it off. At least from what we saw today, there's reason for optimism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I sat down with Kota Furushima, game director of Beast of Reincarnation, to chat about some of these topics, as well as get some further details on what exactly the game will be. Here's our full interview transcript, very lightly edited for clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Beast of Reincarnation seems very, very different from anything Game Freak has done before. How did this game come to be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kota Furushima: </strong>So, it all started, I wanted to get something going. It was an original project. I wanted to try something completely different and new, unlike other stuff we've made. And it just so happened that internally, here at Game Freak, we have a program we call the Gear Project, which is sort of an internal contest run by our president, Satoshi Tajiri, to make original IP within the company. So, I entered my design doc into that contest, and I was able to get permission to start working on a project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I should mention too, to clarify, it wasn't so much that I was trying to do something different than what we've done before. I started with the concept of the feeling that I wanted to get across to the users, the feeling of loneliness, isolation, and warmth, and the game design that we have now kind of coalesced naturally around that concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long ago was it that you entered this in the contest?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>It was about six years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation does seem to be a significantly larger game than some of the other, I guess, non-Pokemon projects you've worked on before. Did the studio have to scale up significantly for Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak. We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>PR reached out post-interview to clarify that the internal Game Freak team working on Beast of Reincarnation is "relatively small" while still playing a core role in leading the project through direction and management.</em>] </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you tell me about the original pitch that you entered into the contest, like what that original sort of design looked like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, it was pretty simple at first. The general concept was the idea of taking a journey along with a companion. That was the main pillar of the game, and you started thinking about the feelings you wanted the player to have, and gradually, the design sort of began to coalesce around that idea of the journey with the companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was there anything in particular that inspired you throughout the development of the game, other games, film, art, music, just any other art in particular that you were thinking of, as you worked on Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. I mentioned I'm a big fan of science fiction movies to start with, and because I wanted to create this new world that no one had seen before, I started really putting a lot of thought into the way world building is done and science fiction. Blade Runner was a specific one that I can mention, that does such a good job of world building. I wanted to try and create my own world in a similar sort of fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, Beast of Reincarnation, I know, was originally announced under the Private Division label when it was part of Take-Two, and then Private Division got acquired, renamed, and is now being run by different people. I'm curious if all those changes impacted the development of Beast of Reincarnation in any way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> There's probably not much I can say about that, to be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, tell me a bit about the structure of Beast of Reincarnation. Is it a linear, story focused game? Is it open world, Metroidvania, something else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The way we created this game, it is about a journey with a beginning, middle, and end, right? It kind of conjures up images of a road movie sort of thing, so it's not open world in the purest sense. The game is comprised of different stages, but these stages I would not describe as linear either. There's quite a lot of room for exploration, a lot of radiation between the different environments and things of that nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are you primarily doing in these different stages? Are you primarily fighting creatures? Are you doing more exploration? Are there puzzles? What are the main activities that you're doing as the character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> You're doing a lot of different things in the game. I think there are no traditional puzzles to put block progress, for instance, as you saw them, but there are definitely puzzle adjacent segments of the game. For example, this game takes place in a world that's been largely destroyed, so you could come to a part where you want to get across a chasm, and the bridge has been destroyed, so you have to start thinking, "How can I get across there?" Now, luckily, Emma, the main character, has a lot of abilities at her disposal. She can extend at the vine or plant, I don't know what you call it, her hair actually. I mean, she can use that, for example, to cross a chasm instead of a bridge, right? So she has certain abilities at her disposal that can help her get through this world. Of course, battle is a huge part of the game, as well as exploration. There's definitely parts where you want to see what's off the beaten path as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How challenging is the combat?  I'm curious if there's difficulty settings or if a casual player could pick it up and feel comfortable with counters and things like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>First of all, I should say that, yes, there are three difficulty settings in the game. As many people to play it as possible, there's going to be story mode. There's a little bit easier, there's normal mode, and then of course there's hard move where enemies are significantly stronger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the normal mode, it's important to note that the game is not just played through the single character of Emma. She, of course, has her companion Koo. Koo also has actions that he can use in conjunction with Emma. There's a lot of freedom and variety of what you can do in the game. Beast of Reincarnation is, of course, an action RPG. Players have the freedom to think of their own strategy and the way they're going to tap all certain situations, how to best utilize Emma's abilities and Koo's abilities to suit their own play-style with which they're most comfortable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beast of Reincarnation Official Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you give me an example of a type of play style you're referring to? Are we thinking the difference between close range and long range? Is it more magical or physical? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a lot of variety in the game. As far as the main actions of the player that Emma is going to undertake for attacks, she largely relies on her Katana for close range attacks. She also has the ability to attack a long range with bows, crossbows, and those sorts of weapons. Koo, of course, relies primarily on what we call bloom arts, which are kind of plant-based attacks in the game. You'll find yourself up against some pretty big enemies, and the rhythm of a lot of the combat does center around pairing, countering, and things of that nature, but you also, again, have an added layer of using Koo and his abilities to your advantage as well, so there's quite a lot of variety there that different people can use in different ways to suit their own style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about Emma and Koo as characters? Who are they? How would you describe them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>One thing to note is, at the beginning of the game, Emma is kind of a blank slate. She has neither memories nor emotions or feelings when you first meet her. Koo, you'll soon discover, is what are known in this world as malefacts. He has this blight, or this corruption about him. You will notice in the game, too, that Emma herself is also a blighted one, and although this does give her special abilities, the downside of that is, of course, she's not treated well by other humans. She's living a very isolated lifestyle, essentially banished. What we have here, typically in this world, Emma would consider a creature like Koo to be an enemy because he is blighted. She typically fights against these sorts of enemies, so there's a bit of irony in this game, that she ends up teaming up with Koo and they go on this journey together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the music in Beast of Reincarnation? I really enjoyed the music that I heard in the trailer, and I was curious who was composing it and what the vision and style was.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, starting with the concepts of the score, again, the music is very much focused on the game's core concepts themselves, out of loneliness and isolation and learning to rely on people, that sort of motif and sort of feeling. So there's all sorts of different types of songs in the game. There's some focus on amplifying the trusting relationship that Emma develops with Koo. Some focus on the loneliness and despair of the world itself that's been destroyed. Then, we have the bosses in the game, which are called Nushi. Their music tracks tend to focus on more kind of traditional, Japanese sort of instrumentation. They give it a difference as well, so there's a lot of variety in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know Game Freak has a lot of history of delving into mythology and nature, especially with all the Pokemon designs they've done over the years to create really interesting creatures, and I'm curious if we'll see any particular myths, legends, or types of creatures in the world of Beast of Reincarnation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think what you'll see in the game is a lot of the natural environments, whether it be the plant life, the flora, and the fauna in this game, the animals and the plants are very much based on the plant life and animal life that we see here in Japan and we've seen here in Japan throughout our history. Sakura, cherry blossoms would be a good example of that. It definitely has a sort of a local feel, in terms of the creatures that you'll meet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. Beast of Reincarnation looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think when it comes to Beast of Reincarnation, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we're not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We're looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-heroart-1769108376624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Beast of Reincarnation official artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the, I guess they're called the Nushi, the bosses. In the presentation I saw they create these blighted forests, and that the environment will change. Can you tell me a little more about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The Nushi, as you said, they're kind of bosses in the game, but sitting above the Nushi is the ultimate presence in the game, the Beast of Reincarnation itself, which the game is named after, Emma and Koo essentially start their journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation, but in order to do that, they face off against Nushi on the way there as a way to sort of weaken the Beast of Reincarnation and make it a boss they can actually take on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, as you defeat these Nushi, you get new abilities from them, and you continue on your journey to ultimately face off against the Beast of Reincarnation. You touched on the blighted forest as well. So the Nushi, Beast of Reincarnation, again, is the reason that the world is kind of in this fall and corroded and blighted state. The Nushi themselves create these blighted forests around them, as you noted. The environment actually changes. From there, from those forests, the enemies in the game, the biological enemies, the Malefacts, are also kind of part and parcel with what it is that the Nushis are bringing into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does that imply that something we'll be doing is going back and revisiting areas we've been before, when the blighted forest is there or not there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a couple of parts to that question there. So, one thing to note, simply defeating a Nushi is not really enough to change the environment in a really meaningful way. Ultimately, the Beast of Reincarnation has kind of a grasp on all of the land and has kind of turned it this way, so you're not able to make huge changes to the environment by defeating Nushi, but you can absolutely go back to places you've been, and you're oftentimes going to want to explore and find hidden areas and items and things of that nature. There's plenty of secrets to discover in places that essentially you've already been through, you're able to freely go back and keep exploring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is that because she has these plant hair abilities. I assume she's getting more of these, as you progress, that are going to unlock more things. Is that right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Actually, there's not a lot of that sort of exploration in the game. You're basically able to get where you need to go with your default abilities. The real question is how. You can see a place you want to go, but do you know how to get there yet? I think, as the player gets more and more accustomed to using these abilities, you'll start to get inspired and understand you're leveling up, I guess, as a player, rather than the character getting abilities that will unlock kind of locations and places. It's more about coming to terms with, getting a grip on, and getting better at using those abilities yourself as a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You guys have a really long, historical relationship with Nintendo. Is there any chance we'll see this game come to Nintendo Switch 2 eventually?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's nothing to announce right now about other platforms that have not already been announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I have one more question. Can you pet the dog?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fable, the upcoming open-world fantasy RPG from Playground Games, has 1,000 fully voiced NPCs, and, if you do the right things, you can marry every single one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-awaited fairytale follow-up to Lionhead’s original Xbox trilogy was showcased at the January 2026 Xbox Developer Direct, and finally gave us a good look at its gameplay. But, there’s more to learn yet, as IGN spoke to the founder of Playground Games, the studio crafting the Fable reboot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When speaking about the characters that inhabit the world of this new version of Fable, Playground chief Ralph Fulton told us: “They are handcrafted, and there are a lot of things about the way we have built the living population, which I think you could be forgiven for saying is just nuts. I think we maybe once thought we could procedurally generate them, but we abandoned that idea quite a long time ago because we wanted to craft every one of these NPCs from their name, to their appearance, to their personality traits, to that moral worldview that I talked about, to where they work and where they live and what their family unit is because it's important to the player that they can get to know unique crafted NPCs.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's 1,000 of them in the game”, Fulton continued. “You can go and speak to every single one of them in fully voiced conversations. You could marry, it'll be a bit of work, but you could marry them all. You can have kids with them, you can hire them, you can fire them, they are just great fun. And also they act as this sort of Greek chorus, if you like, reflecting your choices and your morality back at you. So, as you walk around, that's classic Fable, isn't it? People catcalling you in the street, telling you what they think of you. It's a brilliant thing in our game as well, but it's a great way of tracking how popular your decisions have been, your choices have been.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t sound like it will be easy to just pop the question to anyone you see wandering around Albion, then, with the way you’ve chosen to role-play as your hero dictating who may react positively to an offer of engagement. What if you’re playing as a goody two-shoes knight of the realm, but then a local necromancer catches your eye and captures your heart shortly after? Will you be tempted to delve into the dark arts in the name of love? Search deep within yourself; only you have the answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fable is a series that lived and died by its morality system, so it's great to see an emphasis on this sort of character building returning to the reboot. But, Playground doesn’t simply want to revive the same type of obvious ‘good vs evil’ decisions seen in the Lionhead games, instead opting for a more fluid approach to how you work your way through its story’s many choices, and, in turn, how its world reacts to your decisions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We talk about how our morality system is more about shades of gray,” Fulton revealed. “It's more about the subjectivity of morality that, honestly, we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or that something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion, I think, is really clear these days. And therefore we've sort of taken that and probably in quite a gamey system-y way, we've taken that and built it into this reputation system that we talk about in the piece, which allows you to build reputations based on the things you do within Albion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You could do big things once or little things lots of times”, Fulton explained. “And if people see you doing that, it contributes to you building a reputation in that particular location. But then the key thing is how the people of Albion react to that, and they react to it based on the individual, almost unique worldview that they each have. And I think that's probably a more nuanced view of morality, but it's super interesting, and it's also just packed with potential in gameplay terms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground">IGN's interview with Playground studio head and Fable director Ralph Fulton</a> in full.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Pokemon developer Game Freak arrived on the scene to give a lengthy new look at its new game, Beast of Reincarnation, alongside a narrowed release window: it's planned for release in summer of this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation takes place in a post-apocalyptic, future Japan in the year 4026. It's giving off big Nier: Automata vibes, with modern world ruins covered in overgrowth and plants, and the contrast of mutated natural creatures and machines. You play as Emma, a young woman who's been corrupted by the "blight", aka the force that's caused the destruction of most of the world. Emma is capable of sealing the blight within her own body, a gift that allows her to purify corrupted creatures but also makes her a societal outcast. She meets Koo, a wolf creature similarly plagued by blight, and through an unlikely set of circumstances the pair end up on a journey together to defeat the legendary Beast of Reincarnation, the monster at the heart of the blight plague.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is primarily an action game where you control Emma, who can fight close-range with a katana or long-range with a bow and arrow against corrupted enemies called Malefacts and even more powerful boss monsters, known as Nushi. However, she's also accompanied by a Malefact named Koo, who fights alongside her. Koo has special abilities that, when activated, will slow down time and allow access to something more like a turn-based RPG menu, where the player can pick the move they want to use next before moving on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer also gave us a look at other elements of Beast of Reincarnation, such as skill trees for both Emma and Koo, a faction of mechanical golems that used to house human souls, and three other supporting characters: Brad, Kagura, and Kunai. We also saw Emma's traversal abilities, which involve her seemingly changing her hair into vines and crossing large distances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is planned for a summer launch this year on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation, and will be on Game Pass day one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You'll also be joined by two close friends, passionate motorsports enthusiast Jordy and experienced Japanese car builder Mei, who'll give you an insider’s perspective on your journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pick up wristbands and rise up the ranks, and you'll soon be on your way around Japan — from its breathtaking rural mountains to the heart of Tokyo. 550 cars will be available in-game at launch — the most for any new Forza Horizon game — including the game's cover cars, the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A major new addition is the Estate — a large plot of land in the mountains you can build up from scratch, placing buildings, roads, and invite your friends in for a tour.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Playground Games, which is primarily known for the Forza Horizon series, finally lifted the curtain today in a big way for its upcoming Fable – a game that was originally officially teased back in 2017. Playground Games has been working on the game for a long time, but we will finally be able to play it this Fall.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5qWGaqzk98" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5qWGaqzk98" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The game's director, Ralph Fulton, was on hand during today's Xbox Developer Direct to share details for the game and finally show extensive gameplay. Fulton paid his respects to the work of the original Fable trilogy's creators, Lionhead Games, saying the team is eager to carry on its legacy, and referred to the game as an open-world action RPG and that it represents a new beginning for the franchise. We, of course, assumed the game would be an open-world action RPG, especially considering Playground Games' history and the genre of the original trilogy, but it was nice to get proper confirmation.</p><p>As was the case with the other Fable games, you start the adventure as a child before learning you are a rare hero, the first in a long time. A calamity affects your home village of Briar Hill, turning everyone into stone, including the protagonist's grandmother. And then you're off on your adventure of being a hero. Apparently, the open world will be available to the player pretty early in the game, and you will find yourself stuck between two rival gangs fighting for power.</p><p>Footage for the game showed off imposing castles, inviting fields, gardens of oversized vegetables, and magical mushroom forests. The protagonist was also seen riding on horseback as they explored, but I didn't see a pet dog, however, which was a big element of Fable II and III.</p><p>Fulton says the ethos of the game is "What does it mean, to you, to be a hero?" You will be able to create your hero, dictating their look and clothing. Combat seems familiar to the first three games, with a split between melee action, long-range action, and magic. The player can use light and heavy combos, execute finishers, use magic like electricity, as well as attacks like the one that turned enemies into chickens. The player character got into plenty of battles in the gameplay footage against familiar Fable enemies like Hobs, but we also saw them fighting a giant fire-breathing chicken.</p>

<p>The bigger question mark for Fable, however, came later in the presentation, where Fulton and other members of the team talked about how the population will react to the player and what the player can do outside of combat. You can buy property and business, get married and have kids, and there are more than 1,000 named NPCs who will have individual reactions to you as well as their own lives. You can apparently follow any of the denizens of Albion and watch them wake up, go to work, relax, and go to bed.</p>

<p>Among the examples Playground mentioned in terms of how NPCs will react to you is that you can own property that NPCs will live in. They will react to you as their landlord, or you can kick them out of your house, effectively making them homeless. Expectedly, they will not be your biggest fans if you do this. Characters will praise or insult you depending on your reputation as you walk around and explore. This was an element in the original games, but it seems much more in-depth and specific to your choices here.</p>

<p>And speaking of choices, Playground highlighted the idea of "Your choices change the world," where some of the decisions you make will make radical changes to the environment of the game. An early example offered is related to the giant seen in previous trailers played by British comedian Richard Ayoade. You can choose to spare or kill Ayoade's character, and if you choose the latter, his massive corpse will remain in the environment for the rest of the game, serving as an undeniable landmark that will affect property prices nearby.</p><p>The big element missing from Playground's presentation, which is admittedly hard to get across in a developer diary like this, is Fable's humor. It remains to be seen if the new Fable will effectively borrow the tone of the original trilogy. The inclusion of comedians like Richard Ayoade certainly inspires comedic confidence, but we will have to wait and see in the Autumn of 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/the-new-fable-is-finally-arriving-in-autumn-of-this-year]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
You can always count on Pyschonauts studio Double Fine to do something unexpected, and hot off last year's fantastical lighthouse adventure, the team's unveiled its latest oddity, Kiln: a pottery themed party brawler that's making its way to Xbox Series X/S, PC, Game Pass, and PS5 sometime this "spring".
</p>
<p>
In Kiln, players - in the role of a tiny spirit - must first create a pot from scratch before they're able to inhabit it, using an "easy and accessible" control scheme to quickly mould a lump of clay into the pot of their dreams. The idea is the shape and size of the pot they create will impact their abilities in the team-based multiplayer portion of the game.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Here's Kiln's announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C11Zmc93-I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
In order to keep things balance, pots sizes are limited to one of three weight classes: little pots are fast, while big pots are slow, with medium pots sitting somewhere in between. Additionally, Kiln features eight available shapes - including bottles, cups, and bowls - each with a unique special move, basic attack, and air attack. Cylinders, for instance, can slam the ground hammer-style, which plates can trick-shot and ricochet off enemies. And on top of those basic building blocks, pots can be personalised with glazes, patterns, stickers, and handles before going in the oven.
</p><p>
From there, it's off to The Wedge, which serves as a social hub for players between matches, and when it's time for battle to commence, participants can choose between a variety of modes and obstacle-strewn maps, the latter all being inspired by ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian gods. At launch, Quench mode will be the focus, challenging two teams of four to jostle across the play space and put out their opponent's Kiln while protecting their own. That's where pot size becomes relevant again, given a pot's capacity determines how much water they can hold - although, as <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">explained over on Xbox Wire</a>, greater capacity is balanced by less health.
</p>
<p>
And once a battle is over and a victor has been secured, it's back to The Wedge, where players can use their winnings to purchase the likes of trinkets and stickers to decorate their pots in the in-game store.
</p>
<p>
If that's got your curiosity piqued, you'll be able to fire up Kiln when it launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (including Steam), and Game Pass this "spring".

		<p>Microsoft and Playground Games have confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> will be launching this autumn, and coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fable - Gameplay Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4zJJSEm1ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Featured during the Developer Direct stream, this is really the first good long look that we’ve had at Fable, after years of build up and teasers. From <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/11/richard-ayoade-reintroduces-us-to-fable-by-playground-games/">the giant Richard Ayoade</a> to little snippets of gameplay with a hero wandering through a fantasy city, battling werewolves and goblins, each trailer so far had been rather short. Now we’ve seen a good bit more.</p>
<p>You begin the game as a child, growing up in Briar Hill, which is when your heroic powers first emerge, marking you as Albion’s first hero in a generation. But then your town and all its people are suddenly turned to stone by a stranger. You have to venture out to figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a huge and seamless open world, and it looks gorgeous. At its heart is the capital city of Bowerstone with the huge Fairfax Castle, and all the upper and lower class. To the north, there’s the windswept city of Bloodstone, with two rival gangs vying for power, and the Cult of Shadows.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to pick from a range of character heads, as opposed to having a full character customisation suite, but pair that with tattoos, scars, and a range of outfits to still give yourself an individual look. As in the original game, your playstyle is personalised, blending together melee, ranges and magics. There’s light and heavy combos, building up to slick finishers, while ranged breaks through guard.&nbsp;There’s plenty of returning enemies as well as new ones, like the giant chicken-like cockatrice.</p>
<p>Once again, you can take the game at your own pace, exploring the world. You can buy a house (or all the houses), run a business as a blacksmith or something, marry people, have children, and on and on and on. These are fan-favourite features.</p>
<p>There are more than a thousand people living in this world, getting up, going to work, have hobbies, go to bed, and start it all again. You could even be hiring them, you could be their landlord (or have evicted them). All of these characters are tracked, they have thoughts about you, and they are all fully voiced, and you can talk to them to find out what they think about you.</p>
<p>Morality returns, but it’s not black and white, with a lot of grey areas and subjectivity. Everything you do will earn you a bit of reputation and, again, the people will let you know what they think.</p>
<p>Your choices change the world. Early on you’ll meet Dave – Richard Ayoade – who’s a farmer that manages to grow himself into a giant, and you have to decide what to do about that. If you choose to kill him, then his gigantic corpse will become a fixture of the world and have its impact.</p>
<p>This classic Lionhead RPG series is being revived at Playground Games (better known for their open world arcade racing), but development has naturally taken a good bit longer than has been expected or hoped.</p>
<p>Originally announced way back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-announce-reveal/">at the start of the generation in 2020</a>, it was three long years before we saw the game next, and then another year after that when the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/fable-gets-another-cinematic-trailer-and-a-release-window/">release was set for 2025</a>. But then in February of last year it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/">delayed to 2026</a> with Head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan saying “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait, and I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team.”</p>
<p>So, does it look like it’s been worth the wait?</p>

Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> info today. We got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">new trailer</a> packed with fresh playable characters and challenges, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-is-getting-a-trio-of-new-amiibo">three new amiibo</a>, a closer look at that darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mario-wonders-real-talking-flower-sounds-both-charming-and-irritating">'real' Talking Flower</a>, and the all-important release date. We also got a look at the new box art. And it's grim.</p>
<p>Now, look, the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' re-releases have been fighting a losing battle as far as box art is concerned. Those unwieldy titles take up more than enough room themselves, and then they add all of that "Includes the Nintendo Switch game and the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack. Upgrade pack also available separately. For details..." at the bottom. But worse than that is the key art 'split', where the old and new designs are slapped together to presumably sell the idea of 'See? This is the same as the one before, but now with a new bit too!'</p>
<p>We saw it used for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>'s physical release, but there's something about the Mario Wonder design that's just rubbing us up the wrong way. We're not sure whether it's the straight line between the two graphics, the busyness of both of them, that giant 'Bellabel Park' icon, or a mixture of everything else, but gosh, it ain't a looker, is it?</p>
<figure data-uuid="8eb7807a63488"><a title="Mario Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8eb7807a63488/mario-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, most of us here at Nintendo Life will be playing via an Upgrade Pack (and we'd wager many of you will be in the same boat), so it's unlikely that such an overdesigned cover will ever grace many of our shelves. That said, we can't help but feel like the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' designs — for the re-releases, not the simultaneous launches like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>, we should point out — are getting a bit out of hand now.</p>
<p>Those still keen to pick up a copy can do so on <strong>26th March</strong>. That very same day, Nintendo is launching a trio of Wonder amiibo and the Talking Flower figure, so prepare to splash the cash if you're hoping to catch 'em all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong>, though we knew we'd get a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/">Fable</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/"><strong>unannounced secret game</strong> was also rumoured</a> to be part of the event. Well, the rumours were correct, as that fourth game was revealed to be <strong>Double Fine's</strong> next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/keeper-review-shine-a-light/">Keeper</a></strong>. A "<em>multiplayer pottery party-brawler</em>" called <strong>Kiln</strong>, where you play as a pot looking to smash other pots.</p>



<p>Set to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 sometime in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, Kiln is equal parts "<em>creation and destruction</em>" as it's about building and creating pots with your friends, but also about destroying them and each other for the fun of it in brawling game modes, like its introductory mode, <strong>Quench</strong>.</p>



<p>Kiln begins with you as a small, ghost-like figure that has the ability to mould a more secure, tough body out of clay. That means your time in Kiln begins, well, sitting at a kiln, as you spin and form whatever kind of body you can make for yourself out of clay.</p>



<p>"<em>Making pots in real life is really difficult</em>," says <strong>Derek Brand</strong>, the project lead on Kiln at Double Fine, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">in an Xbox Wire blog post</a>. "<em>It takes a lot of practice, and you can get good at it over time, but it is not an easy thing to just jump into. We wanted to make the pot-making super easy and accessible – it’s just a button and a control stick – and you can make any kind of shape you wanted. We wanted people to immediately feel like they’re masters at this craft.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kiln - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6C11Zmc93-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The kind of pot body you create for yourself will determine what you're able to do when jumping into a brawl with other pots. Everyone gets a basic attack, but pots with different shapes and sizes have different abilities you can lean on to try and ensure you're the one pot left standing without a crack down your side. There are <strong>24 total special attacks</strong> based on the shape and size of the pot you create, meaning there's plenty for you to play around with.</p>



<p>"<em>A little plate which looks like a hockey puck can have a trick shot that will ricochet off multiple enemies. For cup-shaped pots, you have an area-of-effect attack that shoots out popcorn. Or if you make a big cylinder, that can turn into a huge hammer that can slam down and obliterate enemies</em>," the Xbox Wire post explains.</p>

<p>You can also customize your pot far beyond just its shape, with different glazes, finishes, and designs to add, and a whole lobby area where you can practice for future fights, take out pots other players have made for a spin, and a store where you can buy more decorations and designs for your pots called <strong>The Wedge</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>When we’re thinking about the world, we wanted to really incorporate this element of [an] old, ancient technology and art form that has been around forever; we wanted to really lean on that</em>," said Brand. "<em>You start off in this world of Celadon; she’s this deity of creation and destruction. She embodies both of those things. And you’re this little spirit, this little bodiless floating sprite. But within this world, there are other gods that aren’t around, but they have these little floating islands of their old domains, and each map is based off ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian gods.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We gave the old gods their own distinct personalities. For example, Hermes has a map set in his shipping facility, where packages are constantly being sent out and treadmills going back and forth shooting packages you’ll have to avoid. Then there’s Dionysus’ map, which is like a Boogie Lounge, which features a dance floor at its center — if you step onto one of the tiles, you’re forced to dance, creating a dynamic battleground where some players are fighting while others end up dancing</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Kiln will have a beta ahead of its launch if you're keen to try it out, with details on when that'll be coming from Double Fine soon. Like every other game included in today's Developer Direct, it'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass right at launch, and playable through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Summer Xbox Game Showcases</strong> usually bring some very interesting, <strong>unexpected announcements</strong> alongside new information on the Xbox blockbusters we have come to know and love over the years. 2025's showcase was no different, as the event introduced us to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong>, an action role-playing game in development by Game Freak, the developer of the Pokémon series.</p>



<p>Although we didn't see much of the game in action in the game's reveal trailer, it was more than enough to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how the game could be a solid action RPG</strong> thanks to its crused protagonist Emma, her canine companion Koo and the verdant world they will have to traverse. And if the game only looked promising, the new look at the game shared during today's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct</a></strong> has only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reinforced the generally positive opinion </strong>most had about it, with a feel that is markedly <em>NieR</em> in both gameplay and music.</p>



<p>This project represents a massive departure for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Game Freak</strong>, described as a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new challenge"</em> by the studio.  <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-developer-direct/"><strong>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026</strong></a>, the world has been decimated by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Blight</strong>, a parasitic plant that has wiped out most of the population. </p>



<p>Amidst this ravaged world, <strong>warmth, trust, and loneliness</strong> still manage to shine through, personified by <strong>Emma</strong>, a Sealer who is feared and isolated because she can hunt <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Malefacts</strong>, creatures born from the combination of plant and animal, and seal their blight within her own body. <strong>Her design is a direct reflection of this curse</strong>, as her hair functions as a living vine, a core motif that influences both the world’s visual identity and Emma's traversal and combat abilities.</p>



<p>While the game looks <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">visceral and immersive</strong>, Game Freak hasn't completely abandoned its roots. The combat system features <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">a blend of high-speed actio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">and strategic command</strong> that doesn't look too different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> series combat system. Emma and Koo have their own <strong>unique abilities</strong> unlocked via dedicated skill trees, and as the bond between them deepens, they unlock more skills to equip as their actions directly influence one another.</p>



<p>In <strong>combat</strong>, once enough power builds up, players can unleash Koo’s attacks via a menu that slows down time, a mechanic that feels like a <strong>clever bridge</strong> from Game Freak’s turn-based history to the action-packed experience of <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>. <strong>Parrying</strong> will also be central to the combat flow, as successful parries allow players to stack beneficial effects via Spirit Stones, rewarding technical execution.</p>



<p>The one feature that seems to stand out, together with the combat mechanics, is <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>'s <strong>atmosphere</strong>. The post-apocalyptic world with a nature flavor, the Golems - the mechanical beings into which humanity transferred its souls that have degraded beyond repair, and the ethereal soundtrack immediately brought the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/"><em>NieR </em>series</a></strong> to mind, in the best possible way.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although there is surely more to see, the care that Game Freak is pouring into the project is setting Emma’s journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation to be one to keep an eye on when the game launches this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>

            <p>As the price of RAM, GPUs, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">even SSDs</a> climbs ever higher off the back of AI data centre demand, it's causing a significant price crunch for hardware manufacturers. "It is such a volatile situation at this point in time it is hard to figure out pricing," Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview">a recent episode of The Verge's Decoder podcast</a>. "I don't know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you and [be confident in it] by the end of the podcast."</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing prices mean the company are keeping schtum on how much their next round of gaming laptops will cost. "This is something that concerns me," Tan explained. "The RAM prices are going up and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and in the reach of gamers out there."</p>
<p>But it wasn't all doom and gloom during the CES podcast recording.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When asked if component prices could hit a level that would force Razer out of the gaming laptop business, Tan said he hoped it wouldn't come to that. "We've seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past – spikes in pricing. As long as manufacturing kicks in, and we're able to keep up, it's just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing, we believe that it will come down. What goes up must come down and what goes down goes up too."</p>
<p>So, if you can, even Razer CEO seems to be advising holding off on buying that new gaming laptop for now.</p>
<p>Not that Razer showed off any new gaming laptops at CES this month. Instead, they announced Project Motoko, a pair of camera-fitted, AI-powered headphones that creepily analyse your surroundings as you go about your life, and Project Ava, a holographic AI companion who lives in a tube on your desk and tells you you're looking great, like a sycophantic Zordon – one for the Power Rangers fans out there. All of which was par for the course, when it comes to this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">AI-seduced trade show</a>.</p>

<p>Razer are far from alone in feeling the pinch of rising component costs. We have seen significant price jumps in components since Valve revealed the Steam Machine last November. As James found, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">even trying to make an estimate of how much Valve's living room PC could cost is a headache</a>. The mini PC is due for release in early 2026, but there is still no hint of a price – only that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-confirm-the-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-with-similar-specs-rather-than-a-console">Valve won't be eating any of the cost, as console manufacturers do</a>.</p><p>And it's not only hardware makers that are feeling the pinch. The shortages are impacting game developers, too, with Larian revealing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genai-users-larian-forced-to-build-divinity-around-ram-shortage-caused-by-genai">they're optimising the early access release of Divinity to account for lower-end PCs</a>. Traditionally, they would make these optimisations later in the game's development.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must buy a new graphics card, though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-in-2026s-component-hellscape-amds-radeon-rx-9070-xt-is-that-rarest-of-things-a-high-end-gpu-thats-still-decent-value">James was impressed by AMD Radeon's  RX 9070 XT</a>. While the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is better at ray tracing, the two GPUs otherwise perform pretty much evenly, despite the $720 Radeon being significantly cheaper than its $900 GeForce rival. Still, maybe hold off a tad longer if you can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over five years after it was first announced, we’ve finally learned a lot more about the next entry in the <em>Fable</em> series. Get ready for a big open world filled with jobs, relationships, monsters, and more. And it arrives this Fall.</p> <p>This new spin on&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, being developed by Playground Games—the same studio behind Xbox’s amazing<em>&nbsp;Forza Horizon</em>&nbsp;series—<a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-is-bringing-back-fable-1844482199">was first announced back in 2020</a>&nbsp;and is being built&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/huh-the-new-fable-runs-on-the-forza-engine-1846833080">using the same tech</a> that powered those open-world driving games. And <em>Fable</em> sounds and looks impressive as seen in Xbox’s new Developer Direct.</p> <p>Playground Games says <em>Fable</em> will feature a fully seamless open world, a first for the series. You’ll be able explore every corner of Albion at your own pace without loading screens. Well, once you get through the game’s opening tutorial, where you start as a kid and have to watch your village be attacked. It is a <em>Fable</em> game, after all. It’s just tradition.</p>

  <p>During the Dev Direct, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/">Playground Games confirmed you’ll be able to customize your character’s face and clothing</a>. And like in past games, you can interact with villagers and NPCs, even marrying them or kicking them out of houses you own. Yes, you can be a fantasy landlord in <em>Fable</em>. The worst villain of all! Don’t worry, there are jobs that you can do to earn gold and of course, heroic quests to go on via the Hero’s Guild.</p> <p>Apparently, every NPC villager is unique and will react to your wealth, past actions, style, and more. Playground is also promising that the world will react to you in big and small ways. They list one example where a character who uses magic to get massive can be killed or reasoned with, and if you decide to end the giant’s life, his massive corpse will litter the world for the rest of the game. It will even, apparently, lower the property value of nearby homes.</p>

 <p>You won’t just be marrying people, buying houses, and being a terrible landlord. <em>Fable</em> will feature combat that looks similar to other third-person action RPGs. Expect to fight familiar foes, like Balverines&nbsp;and Hobbes, while out exploring Albion. And yes, morality is a big feature in this new reboot of the RPG series, letting you be evil or good.</p>

 <p>This all sounds wild, and looks nice thanks to Playground’s <em>Forza</em>-tech powering the fantasy open world. But I won’t really believe it works until I get my hands on the <em>Fable</em> this Fall when it launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Game Pass, and PC. Though considering how many times it’s been delayed before, I’m also not convinced this RPG arrives before next year.</p>

<p>Fable fans can finally count down to the long-awaited release of the next game in the franchise after the release window was announced during the Xbox Developer Direct on January 22.</p>



<p>Developed by Playground Games, the new Fable is a reboot for the franchise, releasing a whopping 16 years after Fable III, and, after previous delays, a new release window has finally been announced.</p>







<h2 id="h-fable-release-window-announced">Fable Release Window Announced</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>During Xbox’s January 2026 Developer Direct, Playground Games announced that Fable will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in Autumn 2026. As previously announced, Fable will be available day one with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that Fable will be available on PlayStation 5, and the release window will be the same as on other platforms, meaning that PlayStation players won’t have to wait longer for a release, unlike another Playground Games title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>



<p>Fable was previously slated for release in 2025, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed back to a 2026 window in February</a> last year, when Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan said the title was “definitely worth the wait” and is the “most beautifully realized version of Albion” that players have ever seen.</p>



<p>The Fable reboot was officially announced in 2020, though gamers had to wait until 2023 to see the first proper trailer, and it’s been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride since then due to the hefty delay. Finally, though, the end is now in sight.</p>

            <guid>1413544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Is this a full reboot of the entire series, or does it sit on the existing <em>Fable</em> timeline?</strong></p><p><strong>Ralph Fulton, Game Director and General <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger:</strong> We’ve always referred to this game as a ‘new beginning’, because one of the things we were convinced of was that we had to reboot the franchise. It’s been a long time since the end of that original trilogy—nearly two generations have passed in video game terms. And those original games are still available to play today, looking even better than they did back then thanks to the wizardry of Backwards Compatibility.</p><p>So, we’ve chosen not to be beholden to the timeline of the original games—the events, the characters—really just to allow ourselves the freedom to build our own Albion and tell our own, new story within it.</p><p>There’s a lot of faithfulness in the way we’ve approached this game—and certainly I think the inspiration of the original trilogy is really clear for everyone to see—but we wanted to make sure that this was a new beginning that would allow us to tell the stories that we wanted to tell.</p><p><strong>How are you balancing making a new game while honoring Lionhead’s work?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> It’s one of the questions that we asked ourselves right at the start: ‘What are the essential components of a <em>Fable</em> game?’ And I don’t mean the features or the locations. I mean conceptually. Really, what is the essence of <em>Fable</em>?</p><p>But one of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.</p><p>And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right? It felt imperative to me that this was a reboot because we’re starting again as Playground Games, and making Playground’s <em>Fable</em>.</p><p>And if I’m totally honest, back then I wasn’t entirely sure how ‘faithful’ our <em>Fable</em> game would be to the Lionhead games we love. But as I said during Developer_Direct, I’ve been really pleased to see that this is identifiably a <em>Fable</em> game in lots of different ways.</p><p><strong>So to answer your own question: what is the essence of a <em>Fable</em> game?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> We came up with a bunch of things—the first of which I would say we actually inherited from Lionhead. When we started working on this project, we got a treasure trove of documents from Lionhead that had been in storage.</p><p>Something that I thought was just brilliantly succinct was one of the documents, which said: ‘<em>Fable</em> is Fairytale, not Fantasy’—which is just super neat.</p><p>I guess our interpretation of what that means is that fairytale and fantasy probably exist on opposite ends of a spectrum. I think we all know what fantasy is—it’s The Witcher, it’s Skyrim, it’s Lord of the Rings, it’s Game of Thrones. And I think tonally it’s quite grand, it’s sweeping, it’s geopolitical, it’s serious. You know, you can almost picture the color palette of fantasy.</p><p>And then fairytale exists right at the opposite end of that spectrum. Fairytales are intimate, they’re small stories about regular people; they’re not grand and sweeping, they’re very personal and whimsical and ultimately, they deal with what happens when magic touches the lives of ordinary folks. And also they have this kind of moral component to them.</p><p>And I think that is a brilliant description of what <em>Fable</em> really is—it runs through our art style, it runs through our world building. We’ve really executed against that fairytale idea in every part of the game that we’re building.</p><p>And then <em>Fable</em> has this other tonal pillar, if you like, which is Britishness. You can’t mention <em>Fable</em> without mentioning that it’s quintessentially British. It’s cliche, but it’s kind of true. And I don’t think that’s just because Albion is obviously medieval England through a lens, and it’s not just because the cast have British accents.</p><p>I think—in the original games and in our game as well—there’s a very British sensibility, a tone of voice, a way of thinking about things. And it goes to the humor as well—that British humor that the original games used to such great effect is an absolutely essential component of our game as well.</p><p>And then it’s about choice and consequence. We call that freedom—in the sense that it’s the freedom to make the choices you want. It’s the freedom to be the kind of hero you want to be. It’s a freedom to go where you want and do what you want. And those things wrap up into what people really remember about the original <em>Fable</em> games, and therefore it became imperative for us to include that ability to make choices. Our game is packed full of choices. But also, to see the consequences of that and to live with the consequences of the choices you make.</p><p>So for us—at, like, DNA level—that’s what <em>Fable</em> games are, including our own.</p><p><strong>How does this story begin—what’s the quest you’re following?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> In classic <em>Fable</em> fashion you begin the game as a child. We absolutely love that. And that’s when—and it’s not a spoiler to say—your heroic powers emerge. You realize you’re a hero, and everything changes for you from that point. And from there we do a time jump, and we rejoin you in Briar Hill, your starter village, in adulthood—and for the rest of the game you will play as a mature adult in their prime.</p><p>And it’s then that the real events of the game start to unfold. The inciting incident, the thing that’s the catalyst for your story, is what happens to your grandma and to the village that you grew up in—everyone in the village is turned to stone by a mysterious stranger.</p><p>You’re suddenly alone in this village and forced really to go out into the world, and your motivation is to try and figure out what happened to them and try and reverse it. The only clue you have is this mysterious stranger, who you really only caught a glimpse of at the start of the game. Finding the stranger seems like the only thread you can pull, the only lead you can follow. So that’s how we get you out into the world.</p><p>And there is one last thing that your grandmother says to you: she mentions Bowerstone, the Heroes’ Guild, and how it’s at the Heroes’ Guild that the great heroes live and, if you ever need help, they’re the people to go to. So there’s a soft implication that you should head for the Heroes’ Guild, and maybe there’s help that they can give you.</p><p>But the nature of our game is that as soon as you leave your village, you can go pretty much anywhere. It’s truly open world, so the world is yours to explore. And we’ve written the story so that although there are stakes—your grandmother, your village—there’s no ticking bomb.</p><p>There’s nothing forcing you along the path, because we want to allow the player the permission to just go and do something else in the game. You could go to the most northerly village in Albion, get a job, settle down and get married if you want. The story will wait for you, which I think is really important with the really rich side activities that <em>Fable</em> games come with.</p><p><strong>How does the open world work? Are you ‘level gating’, or encouraging people to go to places in a certain order?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> Right from the start of the project, we’ve always felt it was important that the player can go wherever they want, from the moment you leave your village and venture out into Albion for the first time.</p><p>Even if we know the majority will do the sensible thing—you know, ‘I’ve got to save my grandma!’– we know there are a bunch of players who are going to be like, ‘OK, I’m going to go and see what this world is about.’</p><p>We want to accommodate them, probably more than accommodate them. We want to make sure that they have fun, exciting, immersive things to do, wherever they choose to go in the world. So we took that as the sort of North Star.</p><p>And then we built progression and leveling and difficulty balancing around that. I don’t want to go north and then find that there’s an area I can’t go into because I’m not a sufficient level.</p><p>We’ll talk more about levelling and progression at a future date, but you should know that being able to go to any one of the settlements in the world and have fun things to do there was imperative to us. And so we shaped our progression around that requirement.</p><p><strong>How are you approaching combat?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> We’re taking the original game’s mix of melee, ranged, and magic—‘Strength, Skill, and Will’—and turning it into what we call style-weaving combat. We wanted to create a combat system which was fluid enough to allow you to really frictionlessly, seamlessly swap from melee to ranged to magic, without even a frame’s delay on it.</p><p>You should be able to strike with a sword and then hurl a fireball in a smooth movement. So that’s what we’ve set out to achieve with combat.</p><p>The combat scenarios that you’re going to find in our game are often about groups of enemies—and usually a tactical mix of enemies who will force you into choosing how you use your ranged, your melee, and your magic to crowd control, and to pick them off, and really to navigate the particular combat challenge that a particular set of enemies presents to you.</p><p>And there is still ample variety within those styles to allow you to pick the kind of fighter you want to be. You can opt for big damage spells, you can opt for tactical crowd control spells, you can go super precise or really blunt force with your melee weapons—it’s up to you.</p><p>You can still self-express when you’re in combat in our game, but it is all about cycling through and tactically using the different options available to you.</p><p><strong>It looks like there are emergent elements to combat—we see a Hobbe accidentally hit one of his own companions, and enemy weak spots that can cause specific reactions. Is that built into how you play?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> Very much so. All of our enemies have strengths and weaknesses, and part of the fun of combat is figuring how to exploit them using the different weapons and abilities you’ve equipped yourself with. And obviously that sort of compounds when you’ve got multiple enemies in the same encounter and you’re trying to marshal all of them and find the best way through it.</p><p>That Hobbe that accidentally killed his pal in the video just happened by accident when we were capturing from the build. We thought we’d keep it in because it’s funny, and very much in keeping with that fan-favorite enemy.</p><p>But yeah, keeping in as much of that kind of friendly fire stuff as possible always adds a little bit of chaos and a lot of humor to combat. And that’s, I guess, one of the questions we’ve asked ourselves a lot: if humor is important to <em>Fable</em>, how does it manifest in combat—an inherently serious pursuit?</p><p>So I think those fairytale creatures have a ton of personality and thus, you know, a bunch of humor about them. And there’s a slapstick element to some of them as well.</p><p><strong>How has the classic <em>Fable</em> morality system changed?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> To take it right back to the start, morality was always such an important part of the original trilogy. Even the box art was really about that dichotomy of good and evil. So we’ve talked about morality a great deal on this project. I think that original trilogy is inextricably linked with the concept of good and evil—but I think morality in video games has moved on in the intervening period.</p><p>How we think about morality in the world today has really informed how we wanted to represent it as a game system in this game. That’s to say: there is no objective good, there is no objective evil. Really it’s just about people’s subjective opinions and what they choose to value in someone else when they make that judgment.</p><p>So, as you saw in Developer_Direct, our version of morality isn’t a sliding scale—we’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are witnessed by at least one other person. So, if the things you do are seen by one or more people, you’ll start to earn a reputation for that thing. Obviously, we always use the chicken kicking example, because kicking chickens is classic <em>Fable</em>.</p><p>So if a person sees you kicking a chicken, you will start to get a reputation as a ‘Chicken Chaser’—and if enough people see you do it, or you do it a lot, that reputation will become one of the things you’re known for in that settlement. And people will react to you based on what they think about that particular reputation.</p><p>But, crucially, different people will view that reputation in different ways. Kicking chickens isn’t objectively good or objectively evil in a way everybody will agree on—it comes down to the unique worldview of the NPC what they think of you because of it.</p><p>The same applies for being generous, or being a bigamist, or being a thief, and so on. There are a significant number of these reputations that you can get—you have a word cloud of reputations in every settlement, and they can be different from place to place. It means you can create completely different identities in all the different settlements by being a different person and behaving in different ways.</p><p>That word cloud is how people see you in that particular settlement, and therefore it defines how they react to you in every way they can react—and these peasants are not backwards in telling you what they think as you walk around. That ranges from catcalling you in the street, how likely they are to be romanced by you, if you can marry them, it can even affect prices in shops. There’s a whole systemic trickle-down effect of your reputations to your experience in that particular settlement.</p><p>It’s a more potential-filled system for you to go play with, because you are juggling the things you do, and you’re juggling who sees you do it. You’re deciding whether you’re OK with walking around the town with people thinking that you’re that.</p><p>And if you’re not, then there are things you can go and do about that to redress the balance—or you could just pay the Town Crier to start shouting about a new reputation to overwrite one of the old ones…</p><p>It’s why we say our game will never judge you, but the people of Albion will. Sometimes people have said, ‘Well, that’s the same thing, surely, isn’t it?’ But in a diegetic way, it’s really not, because different people in Albion will have different perspectives on the things you’ve done, which again kind of mirrors the real world.</p><p><strong>The Living Population of NPCs is a fascinating addition—what does that offer the player?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> The Living Population is our cast of over 1,000 NPCs, each with roles, personalities and routines. That whole concept of persistent NPCs, each of whom is unique in a whole bunch of ways that you can go and interact with and mess about with, is incredibly complex.</p><p>When you start working on it, you realize that every settlement has to have enough houses with enough beds, for everyone in the settlement to go and sleep in at the end of the day. It was a fun day when we explained that particular requirement to our environment art team [laughs], but they rose to the challenge like they do with everything.</p><p>In games, you don’t normally have to connect the dots quite so precisely. You know, you’re just building a nice-looking town. But in <em>Fable</em> it also has to be a functional town.</p><p>As an example, early in development we couldn’t work out why one town was so empty during the day. And when we zoomed out into debug mode, it was because NPCs were getting up to go to work, but they lived too far away from their jobs. So, they started walking to work, but didn’t get there before their schedule told them to turn around to go back to bed.</p><p>It’s required a lot of working through, but it pays off because, honestly, as you play the game, you get to know the names of the individual NPCs. You get to know what they like, what they’re looking for in a partner, where they live, where they work, all that kind of cool stuff. It’s an extra dimension to traditional NPCs.</p><p><strong>Does the Living Population tie into the main quest?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> Tying the main quest and the Living Population together in a really overt way didn’t seem like the right way to go, so we’ve deliberately linked them in the lightest possible fashion. You know, there are some times when characters in the main quest will reference your reputations, or the things you’ve done previously—but we never want to force a player to have to go and interact with those things in order to progress the main quest.</p><p>We know there are some players—we call them ‘Bards’—who are just going to play through the main story. They’re going to start at the start, and they’re going to get to the end, and that’s going to be their experience. That’s entirely fine, that’s a totally respectable way to play.</p><p>But there are some players, who we call ‘Architects’, who we know are going to go and mess around with the systems and just see where they can push them, see what they can achieve with it, and we want them to have the freedom to do that at any point as well.</p><p><strong>British humor is a big part of this game—and we’ve seen British comedians in the cast. Can you tell us more about the comedic side?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> British humour manifests in lots of different ways throughout the game. I think the Living Population are really funny because they react to you in a very dry, British way. And yes, it’s in the story and the characters you’ll meet along the way.</p><p>We have an <a title="Companies > amazing [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amazing">amazing</a> cast in this game—and we’ll talk more about the cast in future. Again, that’s in keeping with the original <em>Fable</em> games. If you go back and read their cast list, it’s a who’s-who. And we felt, OK, that is a challenge for us—we need to go and do something similar. We’ve got a sensational cast of characters that you’ll meet in the main story.</p><p>We were inspired by the incredibly rich variety of British comedies that have been around over the last 20 years like ‘Peep Show,’ ‘The IT Crowd’ and so many others. We started with ‘The Office’, which again started out as quintessentially British, but also travels really, really well. Not just that IP, but a lot of the techniques and the devices that it’s popularized, you know. It’s that really grounded, awkward style of humour which really appeals to us. And the actors who have been in a lot of these shows—and indeed some of whom are in our game—they’re known all over the world.</p><p>The other cool thing about The Office is something we’ve kind of nicked. You’ve maybe seen in our trailers that we have a sort of mockumentary interview style. I think a lot of people assume we just did that for those trailers, but it’s actually a device we use throughout the game.</p><p>I’ve never seen it in games before, but it allows you a way to really neatly tell a joke or drop a little bit of character detail in a way that would feel really clunky in a dialogue, but suddenly feels entirely natural when you do it to ‘camera’.</p><p><strong>There’s lots more we haven’t seen here—can you tease what else we might learn about before the game arrives?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> So one element that we deliberately didn’t touch on much in Developer_Direct is the main story, beyond the opening few quests. There’s also the cast I mentioned. And there’s a lot of choice and consequence that happens all the way through.</p><p>But honestly, Developer_Direct for us is more about answering a bunch of questions we know people have of a game that we’ve been silent about for so long. This was the opportunity for the team who are making the game to talk about it and answer some of the questions we know fans have been asking.</p><p>Character customization is one that we were delighted to clear up. That’s something that we’ve been sitting on for years now, but it’s great to be able to tell fans that, of course, we have character customization. In <em>Fable</em>, you can be the hero you want to be in every sense.</p><p>As you heard in Developer_Direct, we launch in the autumn and before that we’ll be talking more about our cast, more about our story, and we can’t wait to go deeper into gameplay aspects like combat, progression, weapons, exploration, the social and economic sims and all that good stuff. We’ve got lots more to share…</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/fable-launches-this-fall-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>While Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon games (the series is so large that it's hard to see how it wouldn't be), it does develop other games from time to time. That said, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/pokemon-developer-game-freak-announces-beast-of-reincarnation-for" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3606a6f8-a353-44c5-bc83-19ef23e07cc0" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Beast of Reincarnation, the studio's upcoming post-apocalyptic action role-playing game</a>, is a big swing even by the studio's standards. After seeing the game in action during today's Xbox Developer Direct, we got a much clearer vision of what to expect when it launches this summer.</p><p>Set in Japan in the year 4026, Game Freak describes the game as a "one-person one-dog action RPG." The person and dog in question are named Emma and Koo, respectively, and they live in a time where the human population has been decimated by a parasitic plant called "blight." Somehow, Emma is able to seal that blight within her body, so she's known as a Sealer. Unfortunately, this is an ability people fear, causing her to live in isolation from the remains of society.</p>

<p>After forming a bond with Koo, a magical white dog with a tail made of vines and branches, Emma is told (by the a hologram of perhaps the most cyberpunk-looking guy of all time) to defeat the titular beast of reincarnation to save the Capital. To do so, she'll have to defeat "malefacts," corrupt fusions of animals and blight. I assume "malefact" is pronounced less like "male fact" more like "artifact," but given that the word was only provided in the Japanese speakers' subtitles, this is just a guess. Extremely powerful malefacts, known as Nushi, are the bosses of this world. They can create blighted forests full of enemies and obstacles players will have to overcome before facing off against the deadly beasts.</p><p>Emma is particularly suited to this task thanks to her ability to absorb and dispel blight, but also because of her trusty sword, magic abilities, and vinelike hair. Her sword is her main weapon in combat, and can be upgraded with spirit stones to get special effects when she parries. She and Koo can also use Blooming Arts, powerful magic moves that slow time and allow them to harm or hinder foes. Each character also has a skill tree, and the abilities from one character impacts the other's; the developers also hint that the two will unlock more powers as their bond deepens. Finally, Emma's hair can be used in various ways for platforming, like as a bridge that extends forward over gaps or as a long stilt-like extension of Emma's leg.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo will also have to face golems – robots with corrupted human souls – and meet other human characters, like Brad, Kagura, and the mysterious swordswoman Kunai. The dystopian elements are a bit on the nose, but game looks beautiful, especially for a studio that's been criticized for the poor technical performance of recent Pokémon games. It helps that this game, at the time of writing, is not coming to Switch or Switch 2, and is instead launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. We're excited to check it out when it hits shelves this summer.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/pokemon-developers-beast-of-reincarnation-a-post-apocalyptic]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A release window for Fable has just been announced at the Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>Following a new gameplay deep dive, it was revealed Fable will be releasing in Autumn 2026 on the Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
<p>In addition, Playground Games presented a bunch of info about its first open world RPG. Apparently being packed with not only British humour, but also chickens and more, you start off in Fable as a child and the first hero in Albion in a generation.</p>
<p>Tragedy strikes as the village is turned to stone (including your nan), thus kicking off your adventure. Multiple regions in Fable were briefly shown off, including Bowerstone! This classic Fable city is returning in ample size, which is very exciting.</p>

<p>Strength, Skill, and Will returns at the core of the combat system, including a variety of weapon types that'll let you engage in fights the way you desire. Ranged and magic attacks are back too, filling distinct purposes in clashes with a range of new and returning enemy types.</p><p>Yes, you can marry people and have kids too, just like in the older games. You can buy houses and businesses too and horde your wealth. This is powered by what Playground is dubbing the Living Population system. There are more than 1,000 of them, they can all be spoken and interacted with, and their lives are impacted by your actions.</p>
<p>This ties into a reputation system, as well as a morality system too. Instead of a black-and-white morality system, this new Fable appears to be taking a more complicated approach to the actions you take. So if you're rich and buy lots of stuff, some folks will dig that and others certainly won't.</p>
<p>You can also kill Dave, played by Richard Ayoade, after he turns into a giant. His corpse will stick around in the world permanently, and will bring down house prices in the area. His sister also won't like you!</p>

            <p>It's a big day for Xbox fans, with Microsoft finally offering a closer look at some of its most anticipated titles, courtesy of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced">first Developer Direct of the year.</a> And that began with a fresh peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, bringing word of a 19th May release date on PC and Xbox, with a PS5 launch coming later this year.</p>
<p>For this latest entry in the world-hopping racing series, developer Playground Games is shifting the action to Japan, with the studio calling Forza Horizon 6's open-world map  the "largest" it's created for the series so far. It's said to reflect the country's diversity with areas both rural and urban, modern and traditional. It's also described as being "full of verticality", featuring roads inspired by the likes of C1 Loop, Gingko Avenue, and mountain passes including Mount Haruna and Bandai-Azuma.</p>

<p>It also features <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>'s "biggest urban area yet", with Tokyo City said to be five times larger than anything seen in the series so far. It also includes multiple districts, each with their own identity. And as players explore the world, they'll be able to collect cars, houses, landmarks, and mascots, all tracked in their Adventure Journal.</p><p>In terms of progression, players start Forza Horizon 6 as tourists who, after passing qualifiers, will slowly rise through the ranks by completing races in faster cars and unlocking new wristbands. In order to move up, they'll need to participate in "spectacular" events, including classic showcase events and "thrilling" new Rush obstacles courses. And once they've finally unlocked their gold wristband, they'll gain access to Legend Island, featuring exclusive events, tracks, and areas to explore.</p>
<p>Playground says Forza Horizon 6 will feature over 550 cars at launch - ranging from classic cars to the series' latest cover vehicle, the GR GT - bringing new body kits, new Forza Aero, and the ability to paint liveries on windows. The studio also says it's better balanced its roster across all performance classes, from D to the new R Class, which is designed for track-focused cars. There's also talk of better vehicle audio and improvements to how cars are affected by the world - including new cosmetic tire wear.</p>
<p>Cars, once acquired, can be stored in Forza Horizon 6's new customisable garages (available at every player house), which can be freely decorated and have space for multiple cars. This latest game also marks the debut of The Estate, a huge mountain valley expanse where players can freely build and decorate their own abode - which is permanent and visitable by friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of pals, players can now attend open-world car meets, where they're able to show off cars and characters, download tunes and liveries, or buy copies of any car they see. And from here, they can set out to explore the world with others, playing street races or new nighttime Touge battles, which see players racing down mountain passes. Other new social events include Horizon Time Attack Circuits - accessed seamlessly as part of the world, with no loading or matchmaking.</p><p>And that's almost everything announced so far, with Playground wrapping things with a few words on accessibility features, all of which will be carried over from previous games. That's on top of a few new additions, including a customisable high-contrast mode, a proximity radar, and auto-drive for those wanting to sit back and soak up the sights without touching the wheel.</p>
<p>So to recap: Forza Horizon 6 launches 19th May on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass, with a Playstation 5 release due later this year.</p>

		<p>Tim Schafer bust into the Developer Direct stream to show off a bit of pottery-making, and talk about their latest Amnesia Fortnight project, turned into a full and broader project. Kiln is all about creating stuff, and then using that stuff to smash your enemies. </p>
<p>Kiln is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC and Xbox Game Pass this spring.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kiln is all in on the top-down 3D brawler aesthetic for its battling, but it starts with creating a pot to anthropomorphise and then send into the fray. You create the shapes, whether with a pottery wheel or just a ball of clay, attack handles, spouts and more, and then transform that into a create or sorts, as your spirit inhabits it. There’s sponges, shapers and straight edge tools, and even just your hands. Each pot needs to be able to roll, punch, jump, and more, and the game has to dynamically figure out how the moves will work. There’s then special attacks like cups sprouting popcorn, plates flinging pies.</p>
<p>Quench is the main game mode, a 4v4 battle mode, where you team needs to carry water into enemy territory and quench their rival furnace. Larger pots will have greater carrying capacity, but be slower to move, so you need to balance your team.</p>

<p>Success earns you XP and chips to spend back in the hub area, where you can spend them on more creative options.</p>
<p>What’s curious is that this is actualy a fairly old game idea for Double Fine. Yes, it came out of an Amnesia Fortnight project, but it was all the way back in 2017! Check that game out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kiln  [Amnesia Fortnight 2017]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVJCxk5VDvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Really interesting to see Double Fine bring an idea like this back and develop it further. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/get-a-long-look-at-game-freaks-beast-of-reincarnation-coming-out-this-summer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Game Freak has shared a lot about their upcoming action RPG Beast of Reincarnation, coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and Day One on Xbox Game Pass this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, the game features Emma the Sealer, an outcast from society for being a Blighted One, and her giant wolf buddy Koo. They have to journey across a wasteland where this blight has caused unnatural growths to spread, battling robots and monsters along the way. All we can say is that they had better not even do a fake-out death for Koo, or we’ll be very, very angry.</p>
<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There’s different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo ead in to strike first.</p>

<p>The Pokémon developer is getting much more ambitious with their other projects, with Beast of Reincarnation really pushing what they look to achieve with their games on a visual level, and it’s building around demanding, technical combat, which is very much in vogue these days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As promised, during today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> event, <strong>Playground Games</strong> showed off <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, giving us our first look at the latest entry in the series as it drives across the ocean to Japan. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">new island setting leaked</a>, so <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-reveals-may-19-launch-date/">did its release date</a></strong>, which was <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">corroborated by the very reliable Dealabs</a> just hours ahead of today's show, and is confirmed to be <strong>May 19, 2026,</strong> for <strong>PC and Xbox Series X/S</strong>. As for <strong>PS5</strong> players, it's not launching day-and-date, but will arrive sometime "<em>later this year</em>," when the PS5 version is ready. </p>



<p>What didn't leak, thankfully for Xbox and Playground, was the gameplay showcase we got, which, you may not be surprised to learn, was incredibly impressive. The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 event was opened with Forza Horizon 6, with design director <strong>Torben Ellert</strong> diving into one of the game's key differences from Forza Horizon 5. Instead of starting the game as a superstar of the Horizon festival, you start as a nobody - a tourist in Japan that begins by entering the festival at the bottom tier, eventually working your way up to 'Superstar' status.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a slightly different approach compared with previous Horizon games; in </em><em>Horizon 4</em>, you’re rising through the ranks in the UK, and in <em>Horizon 5’</em>s Mexico, you’re at the apex of the career you built in the epilogue of the previous game," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">Xbox Wire blog post reads</a>, regarding the shift in starting position. "<em></em><em>Horizon 6</em> almost feels like a fresh start, and one designed to appeal not just to car enthusiasts, but anyone with a big goal."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Playground describes Japan as the largest map ever in Forza Horizon history, with more verticality, and the largest urban district ever included in a Forza Horizon game. It's "<em>a world where every road leads to discovery</em>," Playground proclaims.</p>



<p>Beyond the map, the roster of cars available at launch is also the biggest roster included in a Forza Horizon game from day one, with <strong>550 cars included at launch</strong>. The roster has also been overhauled to include a better balance across the roster.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of updates to how you build out your garage and home, with a full mountain valley for you to populate with garages and buildings to show off to your friends. Your friends will also be able to help you populate that valley, as building is now an entirely multiplayer experience in Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>There are plenty of more features yet to be shown in Forza Horizon 6, but thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer, since we know we'll get the chance to play it ourselves on Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Double Fine Reveals ‘Kiln’ Almost 10 Years After First Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/double-fine-reveal-kiln-10-years-after-announcement/</link>
            <guid>1413505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Double Fine has taken to the (virtual) stage at the Xbox Developer Direct showcase to reveal Kiln, a unique multiplayer, team-based party brawler, <strong>almost a decade </strong>after it was announced. The game first surfaced in 2017, emerging from Double Fine’s ‘Amnesia Fortnight’ event, an annual, two-week game jam that spawns prototype game ideas.</p>



<p>It has remained silent, aside from some prototype images appearing online years ago, until now. During the recent Xbox Dev Direct, Double Fine finally revealed the physics-based, destruction-laden brawler.</p>



<h2 id="h-kiln-ten-years-in-the-making">Kiln – Ten Years in the Making</h2>



<p>If you try to find any information online about Kiln, you’ll find a blurb penned by Double Fine in April 2017:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kiln is a multiplayer, team-based brawler by Derek Brand with a focus on creating unique player sculpted characters featuring crazy physics-based animation and destruction. In Kiln you play as a Mountain Spirit, supernatural beings forever at war on the summit. You’ll use an ancient pottery wheel to create warrior golems called Vessels, inhabiting them and enabling you to interact with the physical realm to do battle. </p>



<p>Created during the match, extremely diverse character shapes and sizes are possible each exhibiting unique attributes and controls that leverage the possibilities in procedural animation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also in 2017 that Double Fine revealed the developers responsible for shaping the early game:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of this was <strong>re</strong>shared by Double Fine during today’s announcement.</p>



<p>Today, during the Xbox Developer Direct, we saw how that game has evolved over the last decade. </p>



<p>The trailer opened up with Tim Schafer, the head of the studio at Double Fine, working on some pottery. That’s basically the core concept of Kiln. Players take clay characters and shape them into whatever they can imagine, taking them into destructive environments and smashing each other to pieces.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>You take your pottery mechanisms, craft ‘pots’, and take those ceramic imaginations into multiplayer battles across entertaining, engaging maps built with the ‘spirit of creativity’.</p>



<p>Double Fine confirmed that Kiln is coming Spring 2026, and a closed beta will come soon.</p>
