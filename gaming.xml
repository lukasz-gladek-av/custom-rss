The crowd is a mix of high-profile streamers like Central Committee and KaceyTron, smaller Twitch affiliates, and fans—and all of them are <em>living</em> for the third annual TwitchCon Drag Showcase. JuiceBoxx, a streamer and one of the hosts this year, has her face plastered all over the convention center.<em> Ru Paul’s Drag Race </em>superstar Trixie Mattel has a makeup space on the show floor where employees are offering beauty tips and touch-ups, and at an off-site Capcom party, several drag queens mill about, their hair nearly grazing the ceiling of the bar. Pronoun pins are available for attendees to display on their badges, and non-profits like TransLifeline have booths on the show floor. — Alyssa Mercante</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dc259b1983a74188639e1d829711400c" data-recommend-id="image://dc259b1983a74188639e1d829711400c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An inflatable live button at TwitchCon.

<p>I don’t blame you if you want to spawn money in a Bethesda game. After spending countless hundreds or thousands of hours playing, I tend to follow suit. It’s easier when you can buy everything you need, and then you can focus on the adventure. So, without further ado, here’s how to use the Starfield money console command to prepare for Shattered Space!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-starfield-money-console-command">What is the Starfield Money Console Command?</h2>



<p>To access the Starfield console on PC, hit the tilde (~) on your keyboard to open up the menu. You’ll likely receive a warning that using console commands in the game will disable achievements, but if you have all of them or don’t care about unlocking 100% of the game’s achievements, you can ignore the warning. Then, start to type in the following command:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>player.additem f [value]</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want to swap “[value]” with the number of credits you wish to spawn in your inventory. The game doesn’t seem to handle significant numbers too well, so consider spawning credits in increments of 10,000 or 100,000. You must repeatedly enter the console command to spawn credits until you’re filthy rich.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-buy-with-your-infinite-money-in-starfield">What to Buy With Your Infinite Money in Starfield</h2>



<p>Once you have a stock of credits, it’s time to go shopping!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: You’ll need copious amounts of ammo as you travel to Va’ruun’kai.</li>



<li><strong>Grenades</strong>: Shattered Space features new grenades and grenade crafting mechanics, so why not bring a few explosives along for the ride?</li>



<li><strong>Weapons</strong>: You will want a primary and secondary weapon to bring with you into the expansion. A few recommendations include Head Ranger or The Prime, which you can buy at Laredo Firearms, or Boom Boom and The Buzzcut from Neon Tactical.</li>



<li><strong>Health Items</strong>: Stock up on med kits and syringes beforehand to ensure you don’t run low. There’s no telling what or how much you can buy on Va’ruun’kai!</li>
</ul>



<p>What weapons do you recommend players buy with infinite credits in Starfield? Let us know in the comments, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a> to start the discussion!</p>

Maybe tons of it is funny to the millions of players outside of myself, but most of it misses the mark for me. Instead, I often find humor in the random conversations me and my friends have when we play games together, or the shenanigans we sometimes get up to. Recently though, there’s been an uptick in games taking a more tactful approach to comedy; rather than a shotgun spread of zingers and Whedonisms—which have their place but have unfortunately oversaturated the market—there are some games now dialing into particular niches and styles of humor that go underappreciated or unrepresented in games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a></span><em> </em>or even AAA heavy-hitters like the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756"><em><strong>Thank Goodness You’re Here</strong></em></a></span><strong>, which is currently going for $16 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, is one of those games, and thank goodness for it, because it’s utterly ridiculous in the best way possible.</strong> - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-recommend-id="image://0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="One angry fire dragon, his yellow eyes spiking the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One angry fire dragon, his yellow eyes spiking the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-recommend-id="image://0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="One angry fire dragon, his yellow eyes spiking the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> makes no qualms about scaring you in its early game.

            <p>Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki "Yoshi-P" Yoshida outlined what's coming up on Patch 7.1 in his latest Letter from the Producer Live event at Tokyo Game Show overnight, including new artwork, quests, and the Yuweyawata Field Station dungeon.</p>
<p>Expected mid-November, the patch, called "Crossroads", will also include new Allied Society quests for Dawntrail, focusing on a new Pelupelu trader.</p>
<p>While Yoshida stopped short of providing any story clues, he suggested that these quests would be perfect for players levelling jobs to 100.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-14-patch-7-1-crossroads-coming-november/">The Gamer</a>, Yoshida treated us to some new artwork, including that of Bakool Ja Ja, and revealed the new main scenario quests (MSQ) would primarily focus on Zoraal Ja and his relationship with his son. We also learned that we'll spend time with Wawlika's wife, Nitowikiei, who will assist us during Dawntrail's Custom Delivery quests.</p>
<p>We also learned that Chaotic Alliance Raids, a newer, harder version of the existing Alliance Raids, are also on the way. These accommodate a raid party of up to 24 players.</p>
<p>Players can also expect more Role Quests once players complete all existing Role Quests for all role types.</p>
<p>Expect more news as we get closer to Crossroads' release in November.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-14s-new-70-graphics-update-transforms-pc-ps5-and-series-x">Final Fantasy 14's first graphical overhaul</a> since the release of version 2.0 in 2013 is here with version 7.0, including changes to lighting and ambient occlusion (AO), the addition of DLSS upscaling on PC, 120Hz support on current-gen consoles and a 30fps cap most useful for last-gen machines.</p>
<p>As Digital Foundry summarised for us, it's a substantial effort that even includes reworked textures, models and shading work for some (but not all) characters and environments, helping the game feel a little closer to its modern contemporaries.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> has signed with talent agency WME to "traffic control all that [he does]" and "handle exchanges with all the actors" he wants to work with, hinting that his next project may not even be a video game.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/">Variety</a>, Kojima admitted that whilst up until this point, he had "personally" been able to make the links and connections he needed, it had "become difficult to manage on [his] own". Consequently, he's signed with WME's "very powerful" team to "work with talented people from around the world and create something new".</p>

<p>"I created Kojima Productions under the scope of 'digital entertainment', but I don't think it necessarily has to be a video game," Kojima said. "We could create a new IP from a game, or an anime, or a film, or something totally different. Anything is possible.</p>
<p>"I would like to work with talented people from around the world and create something new, with 'digital' being the keyword. It could be a movie, a game, or something else entirely. I can't die until then! I don't think I'm trying to do anything too out of the ordinary!"</p>
<p>Kojima also stressed that he considers his studio, Kojima Productions, is an "indie".</p>
<p>"We are indies! Really! We never know when we'll close. We are not backed by anyone. We do everything on our own, from creating concepts to production and even promotion and marketing. I think there are many studios like us.</p>
<p>"We can't do mass production, so we won't go public. I'm getting quite old, and it's not always easy. But I'm creating things because I want to. I'm running a business so that I can keep creating. It's not because I want to do business. I didn't necessarily want to make my own studio. I went independent so I can make what I want to make."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Hideo Kojima dropped a bombshell</a> at the end of January, announcing that - alongside the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> - he would also be returning to the action-espionage genre with Physint for PlayStation 5.

			<p>At TGS 2024, Hideo Kojima gave a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3XizwzhEY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90-minute presentation</a> of his upcoming game Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. While the presentation was conducted in Japanese for obvious reasons, Kojima later shared English versions of the new game footage sprinkled throughout it via Twitter(X).</p>
<p>In the first one, we meet two new characters: Tarman and Dollman. The first one is the captain of the so-called DHV Magellan submarine, and he features the likeness of none other than George Miller, the creator of the Mad Max franchise. In keeping with the franchise's previous guest appearances, such as Guillermo Del Toro's, Miller won't be voicing the character himself; Australian actor Marty Rhone will do it instead. Dollman, on the other hand, is exactly what the name says: a name stuck in a doll. His likeness is modeled on Turkish film director Fatih Akin, and his voice comes from actor Jonathan Roumie. Their introduction is handled by returning character Fragile, who is still played (and voiced) by Léa Seydoux in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> This is the headquarters of our humble operation, the bridge of the DHV Magellan. It's always like this when the DHV Magellan is on the move. Meet Tarman, our resident doctor and geophysicist. He's also the captain and pilot, in case you hadn't noticed, and a fellow Doom-sufferer. The nav console offers a direct connection to the tar currents, the downside being that we all have to bathe in carallium.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tarman:</strong> Happy to have you aboard, Sam. You'll have to excuse me if I don't shake your hand.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> You steer this ship?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tarman:</strong> Yeah. Now, the computer does most of the work.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> So, this is a submarine?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tarman:</strong> Spot on. We dive into the tar and use it to travel underground.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> Just beneath the surface of the earth, there are currents we can ride almost anywhere.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> So what's your role in all this?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> Me? I make sure Drawbridge's grand plans go off without a hitch.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> So you're the commander?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> That's right. These days, I'm Fragile in name only.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> Hello? Excuse you! I too am a member of Drawbridge, believe it or not. It is an honor, Sam.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> Little puppet?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> What? Puppet? No! I am alive and my own master.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> This is Dollman. A man who got stuck inside a, well, you get it. He used to be a spirit medium.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> When I was still flesh and bone, of course. Regrettably, my transformation cost me my talents.</em></p>
<p>The second video clip introduces two more new characters that fans will meet in Death Stranding 2: Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-to-feature-actress-elle-fanning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played by Elle Fanning</a> (Super 8, Maleficent, The Great) and Rainy, played by Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool, Invasion).</p>
<p><em><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> In the place where I came from, no one gave birth to babies. They just stayed inside their mother's bellies.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rainy:</strong> Well, in our world, babies are born and grow up to be adults. Or at least they're supposed to.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> It's only natural that Tomorrow wouldn't understand. After all, she was living in a realm of the dead. I wouldn't expect children to be born into such a place.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> But Rainy's baby will be born, right?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> In due time, of course. Isn't that so?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rainy:</strong> *nods*</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> So you'll be a mother who gives birth to her baby.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rainy:</strong> Mm-hmm. And I just can't wait.</em></p>
<p>The third video clip shows another returning character, Heartman, whose likeness is based on movie director Nicolas Winding Refn, while the voice comes from actor Darren Jacobs. But it's the fourth and fifth clips that show how much crazier Death Stranding 2 is going to be compared to the original.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official TRAILERS DEATH STRANDING 2 [ENG version]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wykkct__1yk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the fourth clip, Hideo Kojima demonstrated the new Photo Mode, which shows characters like Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow making all sorts of poses ranging from cute to weird. Apparently, Kojima confirmed that this Photo Mode will somehow influence the story of Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>The fifth and final clip shows what the developer is describing as a 'Dollman In-Game event', in which protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) enjoys an animated in-game concert featuring music from actual artists. In this case, it's a song called Horizon Dreamer, made by Daichi Miura; the song will be released in a few hours.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a generic 2025 release window</a> for the PlayStation 5 version. Looking at the original, a PC port could happen in 2026, although it hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-players-kaysan-cod-lan-cdl-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last night, Kaysan’s 2v2 LAN Showdown unravelled, featuring the Call of Duty talents of a host of CDL players and two Warzone champions. Alongside HyDra, Scrap, Shotzzy, Simp, aBeZy, and Drazah, Warzone’s Hisoka and Shifty stepped up to the plate. In recent weeks, the Warzone pro players have stressed that they’re better than the CDL pros in many ways.</p>



<p>This tournament proved them <strong>very wrong</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-down-in-la">Down in LA</h2>



<p>In Los Angeles, seven Call of Duty esports world champions (and Scrap) turned up to prove once and for all that Warzone pros can’t hang with the big boys in the Call of Duty League. In the opening round, Hisoka and Shifty secured just one map against Scrap and HyDra before being catapulted into the lower run.</p>



<p>They then faced Simp and aBeZy – the ‘Tiny Terrors’ – and failed to secure a map, thus being forcefully ejected from the running.</p>



<p>As the rest of the event unfolded, Simp and aBeZy eliminated Drazah and Shotzzy before falling to Scrap and HyDra in the Grand Final. This power duo has only just linked forces after being signed to the LA Thieves as part of a ‘super team’ that will dominate the CDL next season.</p>



<p>Even at this early stage, Scrap and HyDra’s energy and chemistry were nothing short of flawless.</p>



<p>Here are the winning moments, courtesy of Breaking Point:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the last few weeks, scores of Warzone pro players have been talking their talk about the CDL, stressing the skill gap that exists between them. Hisoka and Shifty recently claimed the top spot at both the World Series of Warzone and the Esports World Cup, before being embarrassed by the very pro players they’ve spoken out against.</p>



<p>It might be that Warzone and traditional Call of Duty multiplayer platforms have differing playstyles, metas, and mechanics, but there’s a reason the CDL players are the only ones making the lists of ‘the best Call of Duty players ever’.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorder-release-date-bonuses-editions/1100-6526687/" data-ref-id="1100-6526687">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is one of the most anticipated games of 2025, and with good reason. The previous two games in the series, 2018's Monster Hunter World and 2021's Monster Hunter Rise, were acclaimed by critics and audiences, and both broke sales records, with World still ranked as Capcom's second-best-selling game of all time at over 26 million copies sold.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Monster Hunter has been around for a long time, and there were <em>many </em>games before World and Rise ushered in a new era for the franchise. While the franchise was already mega-popular in Japan pre-World, Monster Hunter had more of a cult following in North America. But the games have always been good.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans curious to try out some of those older titles can grab several classic Monster Hunter cartridges for around retail price on Nintendo Switch and 3DS right now--and the best place to start is with Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. You can grab the Switch version for just $10 via the eShop (normally $40), and those who prefer buying physical media can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Generations-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07CZXQS2V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">snag a copy for $43.54 at Amazon</a>. Generations Ultimate is out of print now, so physical edition prices fluctuate regularly. You can think of Generations Ultimate as a greatest hits album, as it compiles a staggering number of monsters and locales from the franchise's history until World. If you only want one old Monster Hunter game, Generations Ultimate is the ideal pick.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for Nintendo Switch</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4375291-mhgenult.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375291" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4375291-mhgenult.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375291"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4375291-mhgenult.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is seen as the last entry in the series to feature the "old Monster Hunter" gameplay--and all the jank and charm that came with it. Originally released on 3DS as Monster Hunter X in Japan in 2015, the 2016 localization included the Generations rebranding. Capcom significantly expanded the adventure for the game's 2018 release on Switch as Generations Ultimate. The game's 3DS origins and hardcore classic Monster Hunter design will be evident to players who started with World or Rise. However, Generations Ultimate offers a much more approachable take on the formula compared to previous entries, featuring small quality-of-life tweaks and faster, more varied combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its original incarnation being nearly a decade old, Generations Ultimate still reigns as the Monster Hunter game with the most stuff to do (and most monsters to hunt). Seriously, it's <em>packed</em> with content. It has hundreds of quests and almost every monster, map, and town hub from all previous games. There are over 90 large monsters to hunt, including a few new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">World and Rise turned Monster Hunter into a multi-platform franchise, but Generations Ultimate remains a Switch exclusive. If you want to play it but don't have a Switch, you can save on the Nintendo Switch OLED as well as the handheld-only Switch Lite at Amazon.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NCMZNJK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Red Nintendo Switch OLED</a> -- $295 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Model-Legend-Zelda-Kingdom/dp/B0BZK5M9TD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED</a> -- $360</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Gray/dp/B07V2BBMK4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Lite (Gray)</a> -- $170 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Yellow/dp/B07V3G6C1F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Lite (Yellow)</a> -- $170 (<del>$200</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">And now, let's jump back another generation to hunt monsters rendered in stereoscopic 3D.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Games for Nintendo 3DS</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4375493-monsterhunter4ultimate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375493" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4375493-monsterhunter4ultimate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375493"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4375493-monsterhunter4ultimate.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-3-Ultimate-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B009B1D7JK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</a> (new) -- $57.64 | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Ultimate-Nintendo-3DS-Renewed/dp/B07X58TKFT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Renewed</a> $38.52</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Ultimate-Standard-Nintendo-Renewed/dp/B07X129GSV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a> (renewed) -- $42.20</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Generations-Nintendo-3DS-Standard/dp/B01CJI62WA?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Generations</a> (new) -- $45.59 | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Generations-Nintendo-Standard-Renewed/dp/B088VHSYMT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Renewed</a> $33.15</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter games used to launch in two versions--a base game, followed a year or so later by an expanded "Ultimate" version that included new monsters, armor, hunting ranks, and more. Kind of like old-school Pokemon. Capcom typically skipped the base game in North America, opting to only release the upgraded version in English. While Generations Ultimate is the better of the two, Generations is still <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Generations-Nintendo-3DS-Standard/dp/B01CJI62WA?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reasonably priced for $45.59 new at Amazon</a>, and worth picking up if you don't have a Switch and want to dust off your trusty 3DS or 2DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Quick note about playing Monster Hunter on 3DS: With the Switch eShop closed, physical editions could continue to climb in price as we inch closer to the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds. Also, Monster Hunter plays best on the New Nintendo 3DS XL or 2DS XL due to the addition of the C-stick, the quirky little second "analog stick" that looks like a pencil eraser. If you don't have a New model, there is an accessory that adds a second Circle Pad to your 3DS or 3DS XL. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=circle+pad+pro&amp;i=videogames&amp;crid=40PK42IJDDH0&amp;sprefix=circle+pad+pro%2Cvideogames%2C85&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circle Pad Pro</a> is hard to find for a reasonable price these days, unless you happen to have a Japanese Nintendo 3DS LL (the XL's name in Japan).</p><p dir="ltr">Generations wasn't the only traditional Monster Hunter game to release on 3DS. During its lifecycle, the 3DS was the sole home of the franchise. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate released in North America in 2013, and it was followed by Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate in 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">While these games have less overall content than Generation Ultimate, they offer an even more authentic "classic Monster Hunter" experience. Both are highly regarded by long-time fans, particularly 4 Ultimate, which landed a high slot on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/1100-6499684/" data-ref-id="1100-6499684">GameSpot's Monster Hunter series rankings list</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to play these games but don't have a 3DS, it's worth noting there are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nintendo+3ds+console&amp;i=videogames&amp;crid=1301HDZR9PBLS&amp;sprefix=nintendo+3ds+console,videogames,92&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plenty of 3DS and 3DS XL handhelds available at Amazon via its Renewed program</a>.

            <p>Rogue Flight is an arcade space combat game with some StarFox somewhere in its DNA, "inspired by the landmark style of '80s and '90s prestige anime", also known as "the only good anime." It's due for release later this year and there's an announcement trailer below.

<p>What the trailer shows mirrors what the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784620/ROGUE_FLIGHT/">Steam page</a> says. You can perform acrobatic moves in your ship while blasting at enemies across nine stages. There's a branching narrative path and an unlockable roguelite mode if you want to add - I presume - some permadeath to proceedings. You can customise your spacecraft and pilot somewhat.
</p>
<p>Much of the marketing is focused on the voice cast, whihc features Japanese actors known for their work on Sailor Moon, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gundam, Naruto and One Piece. Not to offer commenters even more bait, but these voices won't mean anything to me because I'm a dubs not subs guy. I watch anime on a second screen while playing video games, thus prohibiting the reading of subs. (The English voice cast features people from Fallout 76, Overwatch and League Of Legends, which may mean something to me but frankly who cares.)
</p>
<p>Spinny, flashy, rock music space combat is fun, I like it, but my interest here is mostly the aesthetic and tone. For as much as anime annoys me when it's about screaming and fan service, it delights me when it's about sad, doomed people and their awful horrible very bad mechs or space ships. Who does not dream of externalising their melancholy as a horrifying weapon we are cursed to pilot? That's already how I feel about my flesh body, but the anime robots and spaceships have much cooler control panels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mojang want to release smaller updates more frequently for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>, instead of one major update each summer. This evening's Minecraft Live stream <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">detailed the Bravery And Bundles update</a>, coming next, but also another update to follow in the next few months. A creepy update.
</p>
<p>It doesn't have a name yet, but it'll add The Pale Garden, a new biome of eerie, grey trees and hanging moss that's quiet during the day, but which at night is inhabited by a new mob, the Creaking.

<p>The Creaking are tree-like mobs that blend into their new biome home, making them easy to miss among the trees. If you do spot them and attack them, they don't take any damage. Instead, a ray of embers will point you towards a block in the canopy of trees, called the Creaking Heart. The heart is puppeteering the Creaking, and it's this you must destroy in order to defeat them. The problem is that the Creaking themselves move towards you whenever you look away. 
</p>
<p>If you chop down the trees in the Pale Garden, you'll get a new pale wood set you can use for crafting, and the new hanging moss can likewise be transferred or used for a creeping carpet. That's nice, but I'm mostly interested in the horror potential of a mob that evokes the Doctor Who's <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Weeping_Angel">weeping angels</a>. The Warden, a hulking mob that emerges from the ground when you make too much noise in a deep dark biome, is terrifying and produces some of the best moments in Minecraft, so more of that is a good thing.
</p>
<p>The Creaking and Pale Garden are coming to Minecraft's various beta builds soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>'s yearly showcase stream took place this evening. As part of the show, Mojang showed off some of the future updates coming to the game. First up: the Bundles Of Bravery update, which will add a proper hardcore mode to Bedrock Edition, as well as bundles, which will allow you to carry more items in your inventory when out adventuring.

<p>Hardcore mode adds permadeath to Minecraft, giving you just one life to live and automatically generating a new world when you inevitably succumb to a creeper. This hardcore option has existed in Minecraft's Java Edition for a long time, but in Bedrock you either needed to manually delete and generate a new world each time you died, or bodge it with an unsatisfactory paid mod from Bedrock's marketplace. 
</p>
<p>Bundles Of Bravery adds a simple toggle you can add when generating your world, which seems to exist independently from other difficulty settings. My kid - who watches Minecraft hardcore mode videos on YouTube all day long - will be thrilled.
</p>
<p>Bundles are pretty straightforward: a craftable bag you can place items inside which then takes only one inventory slot. Mojang say that ye olde Minecraft used to have fewer types of block, so a mining expedition would fill less of your inventory because your dirt and cobblestone would stack in your inventory. Bundles let you recreate something similar by taking all your Andesite and Diorite and Calcite and stuffing them in a bag. 
</p>
<p>These bags have been available in Java and Bedrock's preview builds <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/bundles-are-making-a-comeback">since August</a>, but they were also previously tested and scrapped all the way back in 2020. This time it looks like they'll make it through.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Bundles Of Bravery, but Mojang <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafts-new-faster-update-schedule-will-probably-fill-modders-with-both-despair-and-nostalgia">recently announced their intent to release fewer, smaller Minecraft updates</a> from now on. This one should be along soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new clip of the curious live-action Minecraft movie is here.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Minecraft Live, the clip is less than a minute long but expands on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">very first peek at the live-action movie</a> we had earlier this month.</p>

<p>The clip depicts Steve (Jack Black) showing off exactly how his crafting table works.</p>
<p>Whilst the sword Black crafts looks pretty cool to me, Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Jason Momoa) seeks to make something even more impressive… to less successful results.</p> <div>

<p>We also got to see our first Bee in the live-action movie, which is too cute not to share, quite frankly.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival," reads the official blurb.</p> <div>

<p>"Four misfits - Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) - find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.</p>
<p>"To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is currently set to make its debut in theatres next year on 4th April. For more on how the film was made, including its set design, head to 30:21 in the embedded video above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developer Spiders says it has heard your early access feedback and is addressing "two important subjects": "combat and character customisation".</p>
<p>Addressing players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/4684396507130263735">Steam</a>, the Greedfall team said the early access launch earlier this week had been "exciting", but acknowledged improvements were needed, including improving the drop rate, adjusting AI behaviours, and making dialogue scenes "less blurry".</p>

<p>After thanking players for taking the time to get in touch, Spiders said it had reviewed their feedback and questions, some of which will be addressed in an upcoming patch.</p>
<p>"We read all your feedback and questions, so we wanted to take the time to go over them with you and tell you what our team is currently working on for the next patch, as well as give you a rundown on two important subjects: combat and character customisation," the team said.</p>
<p>"With your feedback, we noted some bugs that we aim to fix soon with a small patch that should also include improvements such as: increasing certain drop rate, decreasing the DOF (depth of field) during dialogue scenes to make it less blurry, making the feedback of targeting an ally's portrait more visible, and adjusting the AI behaviour so that you do not have to spend too much time micromanaging your companions when you do not want to - making your experience in combat easier."</p>
<p>The Steam blog also delves into combat, "an aspect of Early Access that [Spiders is] particularly interested in".</p>
<p>"With the introduction of the new tactical pause system, your feedback is and will be crucial for us to ensure that the new system is fun for everyone," the statement adds, confirming that auto attacks and picking, in particular, will be improved.</p>
<p>"We are aware that some elements are still a work in progress and need improvement, and that some bugs can hinder your experience for the moment. We noted your feedback on that subject, and we aim to improve it in future updates throughout Early Access."</p>
<p>Character creation is also "another element of the game which is still in development".</p>
<p>"I worry about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall-2">GreedFall 2</a>," Bertie wrote in his fantastic feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-mystifies-me-its-currently-a-step-backwards-for-the-series">GreedFall 2 mystifies me: it's currently a step backwards for the series</a>.</p>
<p>"I've been playing the early access build that's just released on Steam and it's not great, and it confuses me, because the original game from 2019 managed to do the almost impossible: it broke into a busy RPG market and made a success of itself, despite being janky and having some problematic New World colonisation themes.</p>
<p>"But the sequel takes all of that good work and seems to step backwards from it. It's a less enjoyable game to play, it's less distinct, and the ways it has tried to evolve the series have worsened it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new Sony Corporate Report, Sony has revealed that PlayStation will use AI and machine learning to speed up its game development.</p>



<p>On page 16 of the report, Sony had that “bolstering technologies that can help creators engage in maximizing the value of their IP in efficient, high-quality ways, including sensing and capturing as well as real-time 3D processing, AI, and machine learning,” and that these technologies will help to deliver its IP “rapidly and at low cost to a broader range of fans.”</p>



<p>The report reveals that PlayStation used machine learning in the production of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 by applying voice-recognition software in certain languages. This process allowed the company to automatically synchronize subtitles with each character’s lines to “significantly shortening the subtitling process.”</p>



<p>Sony also revealed that it is building its Volumetric Capture Studio, which generates 3D data from people and locations to render high-quality images. They said, “Going forward, we plan to apply high-quality 3D assets, including motion data from our Studio, accumulated by each of our companies cross-functionally across the Group, and explore potential external sales.”</p>



<p>They continued, “In real-time 3D processing, we are pursuing exploratory activities with Epic Games, focused on the Unreal Engine, developed as a physics engine for game CG generation. For instance, we reused 3DCG components from a music video shot using virtual production to produce a game set in the same world and released a proof-of-concept CG-based short film using the Unreal Engine.”</p>



<p>AI and machine learning have been a hot topic in the industry in recent years around plagiarism, creativity, and the cause of reduntencies and with PlayStation getting more on board with its possibilities, those conversations are surely set to continue.</p>

<p>You may not expect the system requirements for a game’s expansion to vary wildly, but it does happen. It’s better to step into such content fully prepared, and to that end, we have a complete overview of the Starfield Shattered Space system requirements. The most significant change is, of course, the increased storage space requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-shattered-space-pc-system-requirements">Shattered Space PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>You’ll find that the system requirements for Shattered Space mimic those of the base game, which is to be expected. Bethesda wouldn’t risk increasing the PC requirements for an expansion, as it would potentially alienate current and prospective players significantly. Overall, Starfield and Shattered Space aren’t the most demanding of experiences, but if you want to max out graphical settings, you’ll need a semi-powerful system.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X / Intel Core i7-6800K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce 1070 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 125 GB Available Space</li>



<li><strong>Notes</strong>: SSD Required</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to jump into Starfield: Shattered Space on day one, you’ll have to buy the expansion for $29.99 or download it as part of the Digital Premium Edition, which costs $99.99. Alternatively, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you can upgrade your account to the Premium Edition for $34.99 on the Xbox Store.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-fallen-behind-expectations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-says-that-xdefiant-has-fallen-behind-expectations.995403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-fallen-behind-expectations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that XDefiant has fallen behind expectations amid company struggles.</p>



<div><p>This week, the news that XDefiant is struggling went somewhat under the radar following what is arguably one of Ubisoft’s most challenging periods in recent memory. <span>First, it was announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows is to be delayed until early 2025</a>, followed by several announcements at the company as a whole, including </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Ubisoft’s board launching an investigation into the co</span>mpany’s struggles</a>. </p><p>As part of these major announcements, Ubisoft held a <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ukxeqgsh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trading Call Update</a>, during which Guillemot answered questions about why the company had reduced its second-quarter revenue expectations by 30%. Nicholas Langlet of BNP Paribas asked, “So the Q2 guidance, is it only Star Wars Outlaws, or is there something else underperforming in the portfolio?”</p></div>



<p>Guillemot replied, “It mostly reflects the softer-than-expected sales for&nbsp;Star Wars Outlaws. We also had behind expectations for&nbsp;XDefiant, which we will give you a bit more detail at the end of October.” He continued, “To a much lesser extent, with a limited impact was a lower expectation for XDefiant.”</p>



<p>Guillemot’s comments are a stark difference from the company’s first-quarter sales report, where he reported that the game was “off to an encouraging start as we continue to grow the audience at a steady pace and plan a quarterly roadmap of content that will allow us to firmly establish the game over time.”</p>



<p>Last month, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant was at risk of losing its much-needed post-launch support</a> if it couldn’t be turned around by the end of Season 3, as the game has been struggling to see 20,000 concurrent players and an uptick in player spending. The report and subsequent community conversations led to XDefiant saying that the game “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is absolutely not dying</a>“, in a recent blog post. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game fell below 200,000 DAU (Daily Active Users in 24 hours) throughout August but saw a 40% daily average uptick in DAU throughout its daily rewards program. While good on paper, player spending and continuous player engagement are the answers to prevent the game from going on life support. At the time of writing, XDefiant leadership still hopes that Season 3 will be the start of bringing players and their wallets back.</p>



<p>A silver lining for XDefiant, though, is a push to Steam. While I’ve not been told the game will come to the platform for definite yet, Ubisoft’s recent announcement that its games will be coming to Steam on Day 1 has understandably reignited the team to push for it internally. So, fingers crossed, XDefiant will make its way to Steam soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/s1mple-return-to-counter-strike-team-falcons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/s1mple-is-back-with-team-falcons-in-the-cs2-scene.995400/</guid>

<p>Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev, often referred to as ‘the GOAT of CS’, has signed a three-month loan contract with Team Falcons, the Saudi Arabian organisation. This return to the competitive scene comes after a year-long absence, and it was announced by Team Falcons posting an image of Kostyliev on social media… Clutching a GOAT.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-to-ever-do-it">The Greatest to Ever Do It</h2>



<p>From the end of November until the middle of December, the Perfect World Shanghai Major will unravel in the Counter-Strike 2 scene. It’s one of the biggest events in the CS2 calendar, boasting a massive $1.25 million prize pool. That’ll be s1mple’s return to glory (hopefully), but this time around, he’ll be flying the Team Falcons banner after being loaned out by Natus Vincere.</p>



<p>On social media, s1mple wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Time to be back at LAN; that’s was my goal from the very beginning – to play the Shanghai Major! I’m very glad that we will have official games before we fix the mistakes and play the main tournament of this year!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Almost a year ago, s1mple stated that he wouldn’t be playing Counter-Strike 2 because of a need to ‘take care of people in his life’ and ‘fix documents’, and that was all he had to say on the matter. He made it clear that he didn’t have the best time with Counter-Strike 2 since it was released over a year ago, and that was likely a leading factor contributing to his lack of active competition.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though. It’s not that long before we’ll see s1mple back on the stage, right where he belongs. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>He’s one of the most storied and iconic pro players in Counter-Strike history, and with such a devoted following, he’ll have a vocal backing when he takes to the stage, even if he is flying the flag of Team Falcons, a somewhat controversial organisation that has risen in recent months thanks to the Esports World Cup.</p>
