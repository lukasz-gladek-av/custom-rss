            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-for-rtx-5070-and-fragpunk-which-has-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for the launch of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-12-gb-graphics-card-launched-will-549-msrp-models-be-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card</a>. The driver is also optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fragpunk-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-its-in-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragpunk</a>. The latter game, a fast-paced 5v5 hero shooter from developer Bad Guitar Studio, will take advantage of the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, when it launches launch tomorrow. The game also supports ray tracing effects.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards can deliver an average 4.6x performance boost at 4K with all settings maxed out. On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the game can reportedly run at almost 500 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode with the newest transformer model. I would wager anyone should rather choose DLAA to get better image quality instead. Also, enabling NVIDIA Reflex can reduce your system's latency by up to 60%, which could make all the difference between life and death in a competitive multiplayer shooter like FragPunk.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Tomorrow, Nacon and Eko Software will also launch the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished in early access, with day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Dragonkin: The Banished is expected to stay in early access for seven to ten months.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two games launched with varying levels of NVIDIA RTX technology support. The first one is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</a>, which supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex, with Frame Generation slated to be added later. The other game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678820/Vector_Strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vector Strike</a>, a free-to-play hybrid of sports game and first-person shooter based on fast-paced, physics-based action. In the title developed by Chamo Games, players face each other in a 4v4 arena. NVIDIA RTX users can enable DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Recently, Valve also introduced support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex (which can improve latency by up to 45% in this instance) in its upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadlock</a>, currently in testing with a selected number of users. The third-person 6v6 MOBA still doesn't have a release date.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Koei Tecmo's PC port of Rise of the Ronin (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched last year on consoles</a>) will support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation when it debuts <a href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-march-11th-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on March 11</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps3-software-update-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps3-software-update-released-almost-nine-years-after-discontinuation.1125843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps3-software-update-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a system software update for the PS3 almost nine years after the seventh-generation console was discontinued in the US.</p>

<p>Of course, the update is a pretty <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">small</a> one; it doesn't add any major new features to the console, nor does it fix any obvious, glaring issues. Instead, much like the two updates before it, it simply "improves system performance", which usually involves smaller under-the-hood changes.</p>

<p>According to Sony, you're going to need 200MB of free space on your PS3 if you want to download this update. You can either update your system software through the console itself or via PC using a USB drive or other removable storage media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=5H4eFQdb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=Pa7-dXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS3 has received a new system update almost nine years after its discontinuation.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking to play Blu-ray discs on your PS3, you'll need to update, as Sony says you'll need a renewed encryption key to play the discs. You can get that key by - you guessed it - updating your console.</p>

<p>The PS3 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-3-production-ending-soon" rel="nofollow">discontinued back in 2017</a>, which means it was supported by Sony for around eleven years. That's not a bad innings for a console, and it's roughly the same time period for which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-discontinues-production-of-xbox-360" rel="nofollow">Microsoft supported the Xbox 360</a>.</p>

<p>Sony released the console in late 2006, and while it went on to achieve the lowest hardware sales of its respective generation, it was up against the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii, so that's hardly a surprise.</p>

<p>Iconic franchises like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series got their start on the PS3, and many of its games have been remade or remastered for subsequent generations.</p>




<p>The PS3 was also the first console to feature a Blu-ray disc drive; Xbox instead opted for the doomed HD DVD format, although that decision would be reversed in time for the launch of the Xbox One in 2013.</p>

<p>In 2021, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-on-ps3-consoles-closes-this-july" rel="nofollow">announced it would shut down the PlayStation Store</a> across PS3 and its two handhelds, but widespread backlash saw the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-will-stay-online-for-ps3-and-vita" rel="nofollow">reverse that decision swiftly</a>, at least in the case of the PS3 and the PS Vita.</p>

<p>Sadly, this PS3 update almost certainly doesn't herald some kind of phoenix-like revival for the console, but hey - if you're still playing your PS3, at least you know it hasn't been totally forgotten. Stay tuned for more.</p>

As far as damage goes, The Thing is equipped with melee moves, meaning you need to be close to your opponent to do any damage. These include “Rocky Jab” which lets The Thing throw two consecutive punches, and “Stone Haymaker” which has him throw a massive strike after a quick charge.</p><figure id="" data-id="f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-recommend-id="image://f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing's main screen, Ben surrounded by icons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing's main screen, Ben surrounded by icons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-recommend-id="image://f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing's main screen, Ben surrounded by icons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of damage, The Thing has several movement abilities, including “Yancy Street Charge.” This allows the rocky fellow to rush forward, tossing enemies in his path up in the air, and ending with the creation of a zone that prevents enemy mobility moves. He also can use “Embattled Leap” to jump to any nearby allies, granting them and him a buff to reduce incoming damage. And of course, he wouldn’t be the Thing without his signature catchphrase, so his Ultimate Ability is “Clobberin’ Time,” which launches all enemies in front of him up into the air.</p><h2 id="h1521478"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play The Thing?</strong></h2><p>The Thing is a pretty straightforward tank. His attacks are limited to close-range, meaning you should always be at the forefront of your team while staying wary of ranged characters. You should be using his movement abilities to disrupt the enemy team, either by using Yancy Street Charge to tear through them while your allies take advantage of the confusion to get picks, or by using Embattled Leap, to jump to a teammate and turn a 1v1 into a 2v1 while also providing a defensive buff reducing the odds of them getting knocked out. As an added bonus, if things start looking bad for old Ben, you can use Leap to get into your backline to recover.</p><p>The Thing is one of the easiest to play Tanks in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and while his lack of ranged abilities can put him in some tricky situations, his big range of movement options allows him plenty of ways to turn the tide of any skirmishes. Now, get out there and make Aunt Petunia even more proud of her favorite nephew.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new interview, the Russo brothers have said that they are open to developing video games tied to their Avengers movies.</p>



<p>The interview comes courtesy of <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, where the Russo brothers were pushing their latest project “The Electric State.”</p>



<p>In the interview, it was said that the Russos helped Netflix develop a mobile game based on Electric State with their media company AGBO and will be expanding with recent hire of Nifty Games vet&nbsp;Pete Wanat&nbsp;as president of interactive technology.</p>



<p>It was said that the company now plans to produce three large-scale transmedia projects based on original ideas, but are open to developing games tied to their upcoming Avengers films. This includes Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars.</p>



<p>“We would definitely be open to it,” said Joe Russo. </p>



<p>“Right now, what we’re doing is creating new IP. At AGBO, we want to tell new stories. We want to tell new stories with new characters and new worlds that people haven’t seen before. So Anthony and I and Donald are working together to build out new worlds. And we have three that we’re currently working on that the intention is, for every world we build to have the scale and depth of a “Star Wars” universe, but in a different genre. And then we’ll build materials around those new worlds. We’ll tell stories in different ways using different media in those worlds,” he continue.</p>



<p>So although it might be a ways off, the Russo’s are definitely open to having a games tied to the Avengers games and its upcoming movies.</p>

Here are some of the best games we’ve played so far in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Fight a giant pink baboon that tries to kill you with its farts. Bob and weave on the back of a bird-like raptor as you track a majestic dragon across a desert during a booming thunderstorm. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>offers these experiences and more in a tightly wound, streamlined package that’s lavishly presented and fun as hell to play. Yes, the inventory is a mess. No, the story won’t win any awards. There’s still decades of franchise design baggage to occasionally grapple with, but it’s all in service of some of the most entertaining emergent battles ever produced in a video game, powered by an elegant but deep combat system that never misses a beat. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>is a heartfelt, narrative-focused social sim with rhythm elements that puts you in the shoes of Rama, a musician who recently lost his partner and essentially went into hiding for a year. As he tries to reintegrate into his social circle and band, <em>Afterlove EP </em>focuses on the mundane and ugly parts of grief and how it can distort us into unlikable versions of ourselves. Repairing yourself after you’ve gone through something painful isn’t glamorous, it’s just work. <em>Afterlove EP </em>takes you through one month of Rama’s life as he tries to figure out his shit when his entire world has been shattered. That work takes longer than mere weeks, but at least through your decisions, you can give Rama a good head start. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Don’t Nod’s return to supernatural young adult drama is off to an excellent start. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s first half blends the deceptive allure of ‘90s nostalgia with an unsettling modern-day mystery, and the result is one of the studio’s most tantalizing stories since <em>Life Is Strange 2</em> in 2019. Through its awkward but likable heroine Swann, <em>Lost Records</em> illustrates the hardships of growing up sensitive, shy, and unsure of yourself. The connections between its cast of four young women are raw and earnest, and it makes the mystery of what could have happened to these friends that would cause them to go decades without speaking all the more compelling. I can’t wait to see where it goes when episode two launches in April. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s third go at its signature cooperative adventure format is its best one yet. <em>Split Fiction</em> blends video game and narrative genres into a constant dopamine drip that never seems to run out of ideas. Its many fantasy and sci-fi worlds are pretty derivative, but Hazelight manages to design so many clever puzzles and mechanics within them that the game’s takes on those ideas still feel fresh. As generic as those levels are, <em>Split Fiction </em>gives them meaning by insisting on the importance of the human element of storytelling and art, which makes fighting through those stages to save them from corporate clutches all the more satisfying. It also has one of the most mind-blowing final stretches I’ve played in recent memory. What a game. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The discourse around <em>Avowed</em>’s release was fascinating. It felt like a process of elimination, the wider gaming public trying to work out what Obsidian’s RPG <em>wasn’t</em>, before it could figure out what it actually is. It’s not like <em>Skyrim</em>, as some had tried to say it would be, and it’s not like a BioWare RPG either, with 100+ hours of intricate questing. It’s also not like <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, the isometric traditional cRPGs from Obsidian in whose universe it takes place. But when this all eventually settled, the result was something an awful lot of people realized was exactly what they wanted: a manageable first-person RPG with a rich story, great characters, and chunky combat, that “only” asks for 30 to 40 hours of your life.</p><p>By stripping back various elements from the genre, and creating a more focused interpretation of a usually more sprawling format, Obsidian was able to give great emphasis to the excellent combat, making a game that felt enormous and still offered huge amounts of side-questing and exploration, but also maintained a clip that propelled you toward its narrative conclusion. It’s also just tremendously fun, and despite the plague-ridden setting, maintains an upbeat feel that matches its colorful design. A splash of happiness is just what we need. — John Walker</p></div><div><p>The <em>Yakuza </em>series is like a chameleon that somehow always finds a way to play with different genres and storylines. <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii </em>takes the crime soap opera series and turns it into a swashbuckling pirate adventure, and commits to the bit so hard that it actually works. Fan-favorite antihero Goro Majima takes on the starring role for the first time, and he’s the perfect frontman for the series to lean into an implausible premise with. But while this game sees the series charting wacky new narrative territory accompanied by new ship battles and other pirate-y accoutrements, <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>still has plenty of the beat-em-up action and endearingly silly social antics fans have come to know and love. How much longer can RGG Studio keep shifting genres while still feeling true to the series’ roots? With <em>Pirate Yakuza</em>,<em> </em>they clearly haven’t jumped the shark yet. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Part cyberpunk RPG, part gig economy sim,<em> Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>expands on the incredible first game with a much more expansive world, more characters, new systems, and tons more fantastic writing. It cleverly weaves together disparate tales of corporate oppression, fallen empires, and interstellar communities using the power of dice rolls and skill checks. The result is a winning formula that fuses top-tier video game storytelling with engrossing tabletop mechanics. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Soulslike metroidvanias are a dime a dozen, but few are as good as <em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em>. It takes place across a sprawling 2D kingdom full of automatons that have become corrupted by a mysterious blight. You fight them to gain their powers and then use those to win even bigger, more spectacular boss fights. The story is more of a moodboard than a fully-fleshed out tale, which works perfectly to give the proceedings a compellingly grim fantasy flavor without ever weighing down the combat and exploration, which is where <em>Bloom in the Mist</em> really excels. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is so back. <em>Origins</em> isn’t everything I want the historical hack-and-slash series to be but it’s a perfect foundation for the game on modern platforms. It cleverly melds the possibilities enabled by new tech with the tried-and-true arcade formula of being a one-fighter, army-stomping machine. Combat is excellent with new parry mechanics, and an overhead map section gives the connective tissue in between battles a massive upgrade. There’s never been a better time to pursue Lu Bu. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Keep Driving</em>—a 2D pixel art RPG about going on a long road trip in the ‘90s—offers the thrill of a road trip without breaking the bank or using up all your vacation time. In<em> Keep Driving</em>, you’ll have to manage your car, your hunger, and your sleep, keep going in the right direction, and deal with hazards like traffic jams and deer. Pull it off and you’ll reach your destination, a music festival, before the end of summer. Of course, like any good road trip, detours might lead you to something unexpected… - Zack Zwiezen<br></p></div><div><p>An RPG doesn’t need to be bigger than <em>Skyrim </em>to be good, and <em>Eternal Strands </em>gets this. Instead of offering a massive sandbox, this third-person physics-focused fantasy RPG provides exciting combat and smaller, more detailed zones to explore. Get ready to climb big monsters and chuck small creatures off of cliffs in this colorful indie RPG. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Not only is <em>Slender Threads</em> a splendid point-and-click adventure game, with top-notch art and voice acting as well as great puzzles, but it’s also the most extraordinary meta-exploration of the form, yet without any of that tedious knowing winking that often plagues games committed to such commentary.</p><p>Harvey Green is a wannabe writer and door-to-door book salesman, living in an ambiguous era, having just arrived in an anonymous small American town. Things are…eerie here, but it’s not until you solve a fairly standard bizarro point-and-click puzzle—dressing up a mannequin to put into a busy road crossing to try to distract a policeman—that the real nature of <em>Slender Threads</em> begins to reveal itself. And no, I shall not spoil it here. Let’s just say it explores the notion of the amoral central character.</p><p>It’s also, crucially, a really good adventure game at the same time. A really fantastic find. — John Walker</p></div><div><p>I’m scared to look at how many hours I’ve put into <em>Two Point Museum</em>, the latest entry in the wacky Two Point sim series. There’s just something supremely satisfying about slowly but methodically building up a thriving museum complete with decorations, gift shops, and employee-only areas. If you want a sim game that will make you laugh, tickle your brain, and suck away hours of your life, you should play <em>Two Point Museum. </em>-Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p><em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em> is part ragdoll physics racer and part serene sightseeing sim. It nails the feel of shifting your weight and controlling your momentum as you cruise down white powder slopes and perfectly manages to balance the thrill of the race with the calm satisfaction of working through each map like a platforming puzzle. It’s as exacting, elegant, and effortless in its design as it is to play. - Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/reinvention-is-key-to-god-of-wars-continued-success<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The God of War series has been an important fixture across four generations of PlayStation consoles. But when Kratos’ vengeance-filled journey to becoming the new god of war began in 2005, few could have foreseen where the angry deity destroyer would be 20 years later. Where other long-running franchises have struggled to stay relevant for multiple gaming generations, God of War has survived thanks to its willingness to change. The most important change, of course, was the radical 2018 reboot that plucked Kratos out of Ancient Greece and immersed him in the world of Norse mythology. It dramatically changed both the presentation and gameplay style of the series. But even before that critically acclaimed reboot, developer Sony Santa Monica had implemented a number of smaller, but nonetheless interesting changes that ensured the series’ survival.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reinvention will be key to God of War’s continued success in the future, too. When the series moved to its Norse setting, director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/05/future-god-of-war-games-could-take-on-egyptian-or-mayan-mythology">Cory Barlog spoke of his wish</a> of “going on to the Egyptian era and the Mayan era and so on and so forth.” <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-new-god-of-war-game-egyptian-mythology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent rumours</a> have once again brought up an Egyptian setting. Even if this is all hopeful thinking rather than genuine insider news, it’s understandable why people yearn for Kratos to visit the land of the pyramids: Ancient Egypt has a distinct culture and powerfully rich mythology. But a new setting is just the start: wherever God of War goes next, it must reinvent itself in much the same way as when it took the components that worked so well for the series’ Greek trilogy and updated (and, in some ways, improved) them for the highly acclaimed Norse games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/20/god-of-war-ragnarok-combat-1740059805617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War's combat changed significantly for the Norse games, but it stayed true to the furious spirit of the original Greek trilogy. | Image credit: Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series has never shied away from making changes from entry to entry, of course. The original Greek games evolved across the span of a decade, refining their hack and slash gameplay and polishing it to a mirror shine by the release of God of War 3. At the end of the trilogy, Kratos had access to a revamped magic system that complimented the combo-based rhythms of melee combat, and faced an even greater variety of challenging enemies. That final chapter was built for the PlayStation 3, which offered a substantial power increase over the PS2 that the first two games were designed for, and so new camera angles provided even better views of what was in 2010 a graphical powerhouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of what defined these original games was lost in the reboot. The Greek trilogy incorporated plenty of platforming and puzzle game elements to help Kratos achieve his goals. Those platforming sections were phased out of the Norse games, in part due to a change in camera angles – the new third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective just didn’t work for that kind of approach. The puzzles remained, but were reformulated to fit God of War’s new adventure-first design. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>By returning to the series’ Greek roots both mechanically and narratively in Valhalla, Kratos’ story came full circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see this kind of re-fit applied to a number of the series’ original concepts. From God of War 2 onwards, the games featured battle arenas that allowed players to set difficulty levels and choose their opponents. These formed some of the most memorable moments of the original series, but were lost in the 2018 reboot. But Valhalla, the roguelike DLC for God of War Ragnarök, featured the return of battle arenas, which had been adapted for the new Norse mythology setting. This return to a feature of the past was poetically mirrored by the DLC’s story, which saw the Norse god of war, Týr, invite Kratos to Valhalla to confront the ghosts of his past. By returning to the series’ Greek roots both mechanically and narratively, Kratos’ story came full circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Norse God of War games are not just reinterpretations of past ideas, though. This second iteration of the franchise includes a swathe of new additions, including the unique throwing mechanics for the Leviathan Axe, a combat-defining parry system enabled by a series of shield types and, in Ragnarök, a magical spear that allows for a much faster, explosive attack style. These are your tools for travelling across the Nine Realms, each of which has its own particular foes, visuals and other disparate characteristics. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/20/god-of-war-3-story-1740060215344.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The original trilogy had solid writing, but the Norse duology took God of War's story to unexpected new heights. | Image credit: Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the mechanics of battle and exploration are the obvious changes, the creative gulf between the original trilogy and the Norse duology is most clearly observed in the games’ approach to story. Across the second era, we feel the loss and heartache Kratos experiences for his late wife and how this fuels a fire within him. He is outwardly bitter towards his son, Atreus, and the pair’s uneasy relationship is at the heart of the two games. Both uncover unexpected hidden truths about themselves. All this is a far cry from the more brutish storytelling of the original trilogy, and the more emotive approach is almost certainly the key to the Norse era’s resounding critical and commercial success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War’s radical shift in both mechanical design and storytelling approach is the result of a different kind of thinking when it comes to franchises. The series’ creators have said that they don’t view the Norse games as sequels in the traditional sense, but rather as extensions of Kratos’ journey. This attitude should sit at the core of any future installments. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Norse games are not sequels in the traditional sense, but rather extensions of Kratos’ journey.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, radical reinvention on its own is not a foolproof way of generating escalating success. Just look at Assassin’s Creed, another series that has frequently changed location and time period. While consistently profitable, Ubisoft's long-running series has struggled to secure continued fan adornment across multiple console generations in the same way God of War has. Following the 2017 shift to an open world RPG design with Assassin’s Creed Origins, the series links to its foundational Assassin’s guild lore has become more and more tenuous. What began as a series linked by the story of Desmond Miles has lost much of its narrative connective tissue, and the new RPG era of games have ultimately proved more divisive with each passing installment. General criticism has been aimed at the series’ increasing content bloat – the classic “bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better” argument – but long-term fans are increasingly frustrated by the series drifting away from its assassin roots towards Spartan and Viking power fantasies. Fantasies that many believe would have been better served as standalone RPGs.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series has now attempted a couple of course corrections, starting with 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage; a soft reboot and return to the series’ Middle Eastern roots. It revived the gameplay and structure of the earlier games and offered a considerably shorter story, which was reasonably well received by both critics and fans. This year, Assassin’s Creed Shadows looks to be continuing in a similar vein thanks to the introduction of Naoe, a character wholly dedicated to the stealth gameplay that was foundational for the original Xbox 360-era games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mixed fortunes of Assassin’s Creed’s shift in style shows that abandoning what made a series successful can cause rifts within the fanbase. This is something the God of War series has skilfully navigated. On paper, the Norse series is a radical departure, but it never lost sight of what made Kratos a compelling character, nor the series’ mechanical roots. It identified the very core of the Greek trilogy – that fiery, unrelenting combat – and built something new atop it. And with each new game, that foundation supported new evolutions. More Spartan Rage options. Cooler weapons. A stronger variety of combat options and adversaries. The ability to play as another character for sizable chunks of the story. All these additions enhanced what came before and never distracted from the foundations that made the previous games such a success. They maintain a clear sense of identity for the series, and deepen the lore rather than annex it. That is something a follow-up, be it set in Egypt or elsewhere, must continue to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of if the rumours of an Egyptian setting prove true, whatever comes next must ensure that its evolutionary upgrades maintain what has made God of War such a success. Back in 2018, that meant a focus on combat – the new games had to live up to the standards of the Greek trilogy when it came to butchering foes. But the next God of War will surely be judged by its story, the true gemstone at the heart of the Norse duology. The development of Kratos’ character from the rage-filled monster encountered in the original series into a sombre, complex father and leader showcases how important the writing has been in making the post-2018 games such a monumental success. Whatever comes next must be built upon that strength, while also striving to make bold new changes that will (hopefully) be remembered as the pinnacle achievement of the next era of God of War.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One thing&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536960/Shadowveil_Legend_of_The_Five_Rings/"><em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em></a> does well is invoke terror. Not just the terror of an overwhelming mass of dark energy encroaching on your fortress, which is what the story suggests; more so, the terror of hoping your little computer-controlled fighters will do the smart thing and then being forced to watch, helpless, as they are consumed by algorithmic choices, bad luck, your strategies, or some combination of all three.</p>
<p><em>Shadowveil,</em> the first video game based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings">more than 30-year-old <em>Legend of the Five Rings </em>fantasy franchise</a>, is a roguelite auto-battler. You pick your Crab Clan hero (berserker hammer-wielder or tactical support type), train up some soldiers, and assign all of them abilities, items, and buffs you earn as you go. When battle starts, you choose which hex to start your fighters on, double-check your load-outs, then click to start and watch what happens. You win and march on, or you lose and regroup at base camp, buying some upgrades with your last run's goods.</p>

<p>In my impressions after roughly seven hours of playing, <em>Shadowveil </em>could do more to soften its learning curve, but it presents a mostly satisfying mix of overwhelming odds and achievement. What's irksome now could get patched, and what's already there is intriguing, especially for the price.</p>

<p>Some necessary disclosure: Auto-battlers are not one of my go-to genres. Having responsibility for all the prep, but no control over what fighters will actually do when facing a glut of enemies, can feel punishing, unfair, and only sometimes motivating to try something different. Add that chaos and uncertainty to procedurally generated paths (like in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/slay-the-spire-the-decades-best-deckbuilding-game-coming-to-ios-in-june/">Slay the Spire</a>),</em> and sometimes the defeats felt like my fault, sometimes the random number generator's doing.</p>
<p>Losing is certainly anticipated in&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil</em>. The roguelite elements are the items and currencies you pick up from victories and carry back after defeat. With these, you can unlock new kinds of fighters, upgrade your squad members, and otherwise grease the skids for future runs. You'll have to make tough choices here, as there are more than a half-dozen resources, some unique to each upgrade type, and some you might not pick up at all in any given run.</p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotaku</a>, the San Diego-based PlayStation studio Visual Arts Services has been hit with more layoffs. This week, an unspecified number of employees were notified that their last day with the company would be Friday, March 7. The news was shared publicly by former Visual Arts Project Manager Abby LeMaster (who left three years ago for Riot Games). In a LinkedIn message, she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that 'many' friends had just lost their jobs, lamenting that Sony had just let go of developers with a lot of experience. Here's a quote:</p>
<p><em>PlayStation Studios: Visual Arts was a playground, and it was also my first job in games. I started as an intern with an Information Systems degree, unsure of where I fit in, and met some of the most incredible people. It was a place where we got to experiment, learn, and contribute to projects that defined eras of gaming. The teams there were filled with artists, engineers, producers, and creatives who poured everything they had into their work. We chased excellence, and we built things we were proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>But also, more than anything, PSVA was about the people. The friendships I made there shaped me, and I carry those relationships with me to this day. The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup. This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill, experience, and passion of the people I worked with at PSVA are undeniable.</em></p>
<p>Visual Arts had ambitious plans just a little over three years ago when studio head Michael Mumbauer <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-san-diego-studio-existing-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to work on existing PlayStation franchises using the studio's own proprietary technology. Mumbauer wanted the studio to lead development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of The Last of Us</a>, but PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst deemed the budget required too high, and Naughty Dog was once again put at the helm of the remake, with Visual Arts reverting to its usual supporting capacity. The team then also helped Naughty Dog with The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>These new Visual Arts layoffs are only the latest to hit Sony teams. Last month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on new cuts at the Technology Group. Of course, Firewalk Studios, developer of Concord, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Overall, it's a widespread disease that runs rampant throughout the whole gaming industry, between rising game development budgets and reduced growth prospects.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Visual Arts was hit by layoffs earlier this week as part of "a further restructuring of Sony's US game development operations". Cuts reportedly included staff who worked on some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">recently-canceled projects</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canned live service game</a>.</p>

<p>However, Kotaku's source, whom the publication doesn't name, says the layoffs were more widespread than that, seemingly suggesting that cuts also included staff who weren't involved in the aforementioned projects.</p>

<p>While you might not know Visual Arts' name, it's a fairly important studio for Sony, providing development support for major studios like Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>These layoffs come after what has been a relatively difficult year for Sony. While the gaming giant enjoyed critical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials" rel="nofollow">and commercial</a> success with the likes of throwback platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony also suffered an embarrassing failure in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just a couple of weeks after launching</a>.</p>

<p>In January, Sony announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">shake up its leadership structure</a>, appointing Hideaki Nishino the sole president and CEO of Sony's interactive division. The change means that while Hermen Hulst will remain the head of PlayStation Studios, he'll now report to Nishino, rather than the two sharing CEO duties.</p>

<p>Special Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake editions can make an already seismic release greater. The remake we never thought would happen is happening, and Activision is making sure to capitalize on it by releasing several unique editions. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake</a> rumor is less a whisper and more a truth. While we’ve all been kept in the dark waiting and wondering, developer Iron Galaxy has been busy working on the remake. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-revealed-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Pro Skater 4</a> will be reimagined in 2025, and you can customize your experience with different editions.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m here to hold your hand as we idly coast along on our boards and check out the scenery. </p>

<p>As a lover of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, I don’t see a world where I’m not picking up the Digital Deluxe Edition. It’s all digital content (as you’d expect) but it includes some incredible DOOM crossover goodies—along with Early Access. It’s slightly pricier at $69.99 or £59.99, but that’s a small price to pay for greatness.</p>

<p>It’s time for the big one—Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake Collector’s Edition. It’s the most expensive by far at $129.99 and £119.99. But it has a distinct physical collectible Tony Hawk’s fans might cherish forever.</p>

            <p>After the success of Marvel Rivals, NetEase is publishing another shooter due for release this week: FragPunk. At least, it's releasing on PC, as its console launch has been delayed without a new release date.</p>
<p>The online shooter was first revealed at last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>, showing off its unique card mechanic that alters gameplay and the environments with wacky effects.</p>
<p>FragPunk releases on PC tomorrow, 6th March, but a message from the official social media account states the Xbox and PlayStation releases need more time due to "unexpected technical challenges".</p>

<p>"Since the announcement of the game, your excitement has been truly inspiring, and we know how much you've been looking forward to launching into battle on both Xbox and PlayStation," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"However, we want to be fully transparent with you: during the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimisation and adaptation.</p>
<p>"Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the console versions will now be released.</p>
<p>However, the developer will compensate players on Xbox and PlayStation by providing all rewards up front, including in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience, and more once the game is out.</p>
<p>Any console pre-orders will be cancelled, but those players will receive in-game currency worth $10 when these versions eventually launch.</p>
<p>"This delay was not an easy decision, but we are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our players, and this additional time will allow us to fully optimise and polish the console versions for launch," the statement continues.</p>

<p>The PC release of FragPunk will include 150+ Shard Cards, 13 playable heroes (called Lancers), and seven maps to battle on.</p>
<p>FragPunk promises an alternative to Valorant - like Riot's shooter it's a five-versus-five free-to-play shooter with teams taking turns to attack and defend.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunks-card-system-ensures-its-set-to-be-your-new-favourite-valorant-competitor">hands-on with FragPunk at last year's Gamescom</a> and was impressed by both the speed of gameplay and its intriguing card system that should help it stand out from other games of the genre.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> on PC has been updated with a new Enhanced version, bundling in a range of tune-ups such as ray-traced graphics and support for AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS, new features for GTA Online, and a heaping helping of swankmobiles for your fleet of GTA cars. Existing GTA 5 story mode and GTA Online progress will carry over, and it’s all free to people who own the old version of GTA 5, which is now known as the Legacy version on Steam. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s a nice overhaul with a few downsides. One is that the game’s system requirements have also been Enhanced - you'll need double the RAM and double the graphics card memory, amongst other things. You can still play the Legacy version if you don’t have the specs for the upgrade, but Legacy and Enhanced owners aren’t allowed to play together, which threatens to drive a bit of a wedge through the community.</p>
<p>The Enhanced version also adds “kernel-based anti-cheat protections”, which may not amuse those of you who prefer it when games don’t snoop on every application you have running from the stinking bowels of your computer, or have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/according-to-experts-on-kernel-level-anticheat-two-things-are-abundantly-clear-1-its-not-perfect-and-2-its-not-going-anywhere/">concerns</a> about the cheater-rumbler software throwing up false positives or exposing your system to ransomware. But the big forum complaint, right now, is that Rockstar appear to have done away with GTA 5’s in-game text chat - possibly because these Enhancements come via the previous "next gen" update for GTA 5 on PS5 and Xbox, which obviously have different kinds of chat functionality.
</p>
<p>
There are many threads about the absence of text chat on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3240220/discussions/0/592890771319858068/#c592890771319866010">Steam</a> and Reddit. Several people have posted what they claim are screenshots of conversations with Rockstar support. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3mxmt/as_it_turns_out_the_lack_of_chat_in_the_enhanced/">One of these alleged support messages</a> acknowledges that “in-game text chat is not supported in GTA V Enhanced currently”, which suggests it’ll be addressed via patch; in the meantime, it advises people to make use of the game’s SMS features or platform level chat features. I’ve approached Rockstar myself for comment.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like picking the straws from a bale of spun gold, but in-game text chat is a feature many have come to rely on. Perhaps you have disabilities that make text chat more convenient, or perhaps you’d like to exchange salutations with randos without speaking aloud and potentially revealing your gender.</p>
<p>More frivolously, somebody’s posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3zxwx/the_newbie_took_off_before_i_realized_that_ee_had/">a tragic communique</a> about innocently boarding a plane piloted by a brand new player, and realising they couldn’t communicate with each other. Hey, perhaps there's a Netflix miniseries in this. I'll send Vin Diesel a request for comment, too.
</p>
<p>
There are also a host of other complaints related to people struggling to migrate their progress between versions. While irritating, these seem more like the usual launch-day bugs.</p>
<p>Of course, the lion’s share of disgruntled responses to Rockstar’s social media posts about the update are from people pining for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> trailer. The game remains slated for console launch later this year so it's definitely high time we had a video. Maybe even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">GTA 6 PC release date</a>, as a treat.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-pre-order-bonuses-have-been-found-on-steam.1125747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie’s next game, Marathon, has reportedly had its pre-order bonuses uploaded to the backend on Steam.</p>



<p>That’s according to the SteamDB Discord server (and reported to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3pv6f/marathon_preorder_cosmetics_found_in_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>), who noticed that that extra editions of Marathon and packages relating to pre-order bonuses were uploaded to Steam.</p>



<p>According to the information, such pre-order bonuses will include free Marathon skins that can be used in Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Such an update suggests that the game will be announced soon, and according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, he said in February that he believes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/">Bungie will reveal </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/"> in April</a>.</p>



<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play,” he said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was first revealed on May 24, 2023, with a teaser trailer revealing that the game would be a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter. </p>



<p>In June 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s gameplay loop</a>, including an experimental feature that would see players have an in-game timer controlled by their oxygen supply. </p>



<p>Marathon is scheduled to release in 2025 for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing more of Bungie’s Marathon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Astarion is featured in the 2025 edition of the Monster Manual - or at least, a quote from him is - as spotted by Baldur's Gate 3 fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1j0wrn4/astarion_mentioned_in_the_new_monster_manual/">reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/the-baldurs-gate-3-arization-of-dungeons-and-dragons-continues-as-astarion-gets-2-official-mentions-in-the-new-source-books/">GamesRadar</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"Darling, you are simply delicious," Astarion says, atop the Monster Manual page detailing Vampire Spawn (medium or small Undead, Neutral Evil). And this isn't the first time Astarion has popped up in official D&amp;D lore either.
</p>
<p>
Astarion previously popped up in the official D&amp;D Player's Handbook (2024 edition) as seen in an eye-catching piece of artwork for the daylight spell.

Here, Astarion can be spotted tucked away in the bottom right corner, unafflicted by the spell's effects which have begun to burn up all his vampire spawn brethren. (Astarion canonically is immune to sunlight, thanks to the handy plot device of having his illithid tadpole in his brain).
</p>
<p>
Last year's handbook did not specifically confirm it was Astarion in the artwork, but <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/astarion-from-baldurs-gate-3-appears-in-the-2024-players-handbook.706670/">ENWorld</a> later got acknowledgement from the illustration's artist that it was an official appearance by the character, the rights to which are owned by D&amp;D maker Wizards of the Coast.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has now wrapped up work on the game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">one final patch that added in Xbox Series S splitscreen support</a>. The studio has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">now begun work on its next game</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">it won't be Baldur's Gate 4 or anything at all to do with D&amp;D</a>. Still, it's highly likely we will see a new entry in the series launch at some point - even if it is from another developer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You wait for ages for a bus to come along, and then two arrive at once. It’s not something you’d expect in the controller world, but GameSir are absolutely smashing things out of the park right now. Not content with the already well-featured and excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> – which we were only just able to review – GameSir has just launched <em>another</em> multiformat controller, the Super Nova. In many ways they feel like opposing sides of the same leaf, giving gamers a choice of subtly different controller designs. Well, as long as they’re GameSir controllers.</p>
<p>The Super Nova looks and feels amazing. There’s a lot to be said for a controller that you hand to someone and they immediately respond with generous oohs and aahs. The Super Nova is that controller. The weight here is just right, with enough heft to feel premium and powerful without it feeling like you’re manhandling a brick. At 263g, it shaves a little bit from the Official Xbox Controller’s 287g, which makes it less of a chore through long stints, but has enough heft that you’re not wondering what you’ve spent your money on.</p>
<p>There’s also rubberised grips that wrap all the way around both arms so that your hands feel absolutely set in place when you’re playing – here it’s definitely a step up from the Cyclone 2 which has textured plastic instead. In terms of immediate feel, the Super Nova is the new GameSir king. You’ll be even more impressed when you discover that it’s less than £50.</p>


<p>Visually, the two are distinct, but fairly similar, especially in how they both feature RGB strips running around the controller. The difference with the Super Nova is that they’re not hidden away, whereas the Cyclone 2’s strips are within the body, shining through the translucent plastic. Personally, I think the Super Nova is the better looking of the two, the LED strip providing a hard line between the body and the arms of the gamepad, but it’ll very much come down to individual preference.</p>


<p>The included charging stand continues the Super Nova’s RGB lights, and one of the nicest touches is the way that they line up and cycle as a complete circuit when you put the controller on the base. The base gives you an extra USB-A socket too, which can play home to the 2.4Ghz dongle, keeping everything neat and tidy. There’s also Bluetooth built in and wired support, meaning the Super Nova works perfectly across PC, Nintendo Switch, mobile and Smart TV platforms.</p>
<p>There are some key differences between the Super Nova and the Cyclone 2, and primary amongst them are the buttons. The Super Nova says it uses ‘silent’ buttons, but they’re fairly traditional membrane buttons across the board, including the D-pad. It’s a step down from the microswitch-equipped Cyclone 2, but they are much quieter if that’s important to you. They do feel nice and solid, and work perfectly well, and the ABXY buttons are slightly larger, making them easy to locate in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>You can also physically move them around, which is ideal if you want to swap to a Switch-centric face button layout, with the magnetic faceplate lifting off easily so that you can access the internal components. You can replace the analogue stick tops too, though there are no additional parts included in the box. I should note that you need to be in a settled environment when you take it apart, as I nearly lost my X button while popping everything out. You definitely don’t want to lose one of them!</p>
<p>As with the Cyclone 2, and the majority of the latest controller releases, the Super Nova uses Hall Effect analogue sticks and triggers. Not only are they more precise – the Super Nova’s two analogue sticks both achieved 100% accuracy on Gamepad Tester – but they will last for a very, very long time thanks to the wizardry of magnets. If you’re the kind of person who’s worn out multiple Xbox controllers and Switch Joy-Con, the Super Nova is an ideal replacement, and at this price it’s an easy choice.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of FPS – I’ve continued to be mildly average at Overwatch 2, but I’ve seen more Play of the Game awards than ever before – then the inclusion of trigger lockouts will be perfect for you. This is something I adore in controllers; shortening the length of time to activate the trigger means that your response time is quicker, and in a head-to-head shoot-off against someone without lockouts, you’re the one who’s going to win.&nbsp;The Super Nova’s lockouts are more traditional than those seen in the Cyclone 2, and as a result they feel sturdier, but at the cost of losing the microswitch element that GameSir including there.</p>

<p>You’ve also got two back paddles, and they’re well placed beneath your fingers but firm enough that you won’t activate them unintentionally. It’s easy to program these on the fly, or you can dig into this and other functions in the GameSir Connect software. Just like the Cyclone 2, I’d be slightly wary of hitting the update firmware button – there’s a known bug lurking around that soft locks your controllers, requiring a reset via the rest button on the back – but beyond that it’s a deep and extremely useable piece of software.</p>
<p>Around the back, you’ve also got a selector to move between Bluetooth connections and the 2.4 GHz dongle, and while it’s nice to have that physical action, it’s very closely inlaid into the rear of the controller, and a little tricky to activate. While the Bluetooth connection is relatively snappy, it can’t compete with the 1000Hz polling rate of the 2.4GHz dongle. It means that the Super Nova is wickedly fast, and when you add together the feel, the features and the responsiveness, you find a ‘pro’ controller in all but name.</p>
<p>At £50 – or even cheaper if you shop around – the Super Nova is incredible value for money. The clearest competition for the Super Nova is, of course, its sibling, the Cyclone 2, or indeed Gamesir’s wired offering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/25/gamesir-g7-se-wired-controller-review/">G7 SE</a>. They’re all packed with Hall Effect sticks and triggers, and various other ‘pro’ features while undercutting the standard offerings from everyone else. As much as I like them, you can’t compare a Switch Pro Controller to the Super Nova, and if you’re looking for a Switch controller in particular, Gamesir’s latest is the one you should get.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/absolum-is-the-next-game-from-streets-of-rage-4-developer-guard-crush-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Guard Crush Games, Supamonks and Dotemu have announced Absolum, a brand new fantasy brawler that is due to be released later this year. The confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, PS4 and Switch. The announcement trailer opens up with guards clamping down on those who live in this game world, until they are interrupted by two rebels, one wielding a sword and magic while the other has an axe and a gun. The visuals look sublime.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvI172bkKDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Absolum will allow you to play as one of four rebel heroes, including the sword wielder and the gun toting dwarf. The other rebels are not showcased in this trailer, but are part of the artwork. The world is known as Talamh, and it will be a world that will be different each time you play with multiple paths and changing enemy encounters on each playthrough. Dotemu has announced that a full gameplay trailer will be released in the next few months, and it is likely we will see the other two characters come in to play. Talamh is under the control of Sun King Azra and his loyal princes, who terrorise the local population.&nbsp; High Enchantress Uchawi brings the rebels together to overthrow Azra and his loyalists.</p>
<p>The rebels of Absolum are Galandra, the sword wielder you see in the trailer, and she has necromatic powers which are destructive. Karl is the dwarf in the trailer, and he is also the last free dwarf in all of Talamh. His blunderbuss gives him access to explosive moves, and his strength is ideal for close quarter combat. Brome, who is not seen in the trailer, is a wizard, and the final character, also not in the trailer, is Cider who is described as a “nimble skirmisher.”</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Streets of Rage 4 review, I wrote, <em>“Streets of Rage 4 is a must for any beat ‘em up fans, especially those with fond memories of the original trilogy. The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.”</em></p>

			<p>Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent has increased its stake in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, edging closer to Sony's shares in the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-additional-shares-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a> today, Japanese publication Nikkei revealed that Tencent has increased its stake in the company by 1.11%, bringing it to 7.97%. The Chinese conglomerate confirmed the company had increased its share in FromSoftware's parent company as part of a <em>"capital business alliance"</em> between the two parties.</p>
<p>Despite increasing its share ratio, Tencent still isn't the largest shareholder in Kadokawa. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/">December</a>, Sony and Kadokawa confirmed that the two companies had entered a strategic capital and business alliance that made Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa stock. The alliance will allow Kadokawa to realize the company's Global Media Mix strategy, which involves the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is only one of the game development studios owned by Kadokawa, but it is definitely the most popular. The creator of the Souls series is now working on an Elden Ring spin-off called Elden Ring: Nightreign which combines mechanics from the main game with roguelike elements to provide a co-op experience that has ton of potential, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</em></p>

            <p>Nintendo has won another lawsuit this week, this time against a pair of counterfeit sellers selling fake amiibo cards on Amazon.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Nintendo and Amazon filed a joint lawsuit against the counterfeiters for allegedly selling fake Nintendo goods, but the sellers failed to respond.</p>
<p>Now a Seattle district judge has issued a default judgement in the companies' favour, awarding over $7m in trademark infringement damages (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/533664/nintendo-7-million-counterfeit-amiibo-lawsuit-trademark-infringement">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically, Nintendo sought $705,963 against one seller through several seller accounts, $6.2m against another seller with several accounts, and $47,652 against both for a shared account.</p>
<p>"The Court finds this damages request to be reasonable, in light of the nature of the deceptive scheme, the scope of the sales, the involvement of each Defendant, as well as the need for compensation, deterrence, and punishment," court documents read. "The Court therefore awards Nintendo damages in the amounts and allocations sought."</p>
<p>Amazon shut down the sellers' accounts ahead of filing the original complaint.</p>
<p>"Nintendo utilises both internal and external resources to combat counterfeit and infringing products," wrote lawyers in that original complaint. "Nintendo works with a third-party brand protection service vendor on the detection and removal of product listings violating Nintendo's IP rights that are identified and sold in Amazon's stores. Nintendo works regularly and collaboratively with Amazon to identify counterfeit Nintendo products and to strengthen automated detection and removal of the products from Amazon's stores."</p>
<p>The news follows an announcement from Nintendo yesterday it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">successful in a lawsuit against French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which operates the website 1fichier.com. The decision was "significant" in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games, as well as for "the entire games industry".</p>
<p>Other lawsuit wins include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">against Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, which shut down and paid Nintendo $2.4m, as well as against a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">streamer who broadcast pirated games</a> last year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most high-profile legal action from Nintendo, though, is its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>. The Pokémon-with-guns game has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-32m-players-a-year-after-release-but-nintendo-lawsuit-remains-unresolved">surpassed 32 million players</a> a year after its release, but the legal case currently remains unresolved.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bad Guitar Studio’s Fragpunk is being touted as a game-changer for online shooters. Its console release date is a big talking point for PlayStation and Xbox users, so let’s check out the latest details on the launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-new-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fragpunk</a> delivers Indiana Jones-sized Short Rounds with quick battles and ever-changing dynamics. It may be a Hero shooter—taking inspiration from Overwatch and Marvel Rivals—but it has its fresh twists. Shard Cards allow players to customize their playstyle on the fly, midgame with gameplay-altering abilities.</p>



<p>It looks cool, it enjoyed a smooth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-closed-beta-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a>, and its PC release is already locked in. But what about if you’re waiting for the Fragpunk console release?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fragpunk-come-out-on-console">When Does Fragpunk Come Out on Console?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Do you take American Express? Credit to Bad Guitar Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fragpunk’s console release date has been delayed indefinitely until an unspecified date.</strong></p>



<p>The news has shocked players waiting to gear up for Fragpunk on PlayStation and Xbox. The March 6 release date is only happening for PC players now, and the developer has neglected to reveal so much as a vague release window to look forward to.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-has-fragpunk-s-console-release-date-been-delayed">Why Has Fragpunk’s Console Release Date Been Delayed?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Bad Guitar Studio provided an update on March 4 to explain the delay was due to “console compliance testing” issues.</strong></p>



<p>The explanation came via a March 4 post on the team’s official <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X social media page</a>.</p>



<p>“During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation. Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no update or timeframe is provided for a Fragpunk console release. All that’s promised is the “Team is working closely with both the Xbox and PlayStation teams to get Fragpunk into your hands as soon as possible.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>A message from FragPunk team about the delay of the launch on console platforms:</span></p></article></div>



<p>Console players who jumped on board early will be compensated at least. Players can claim a ton of engagement rewards, refunds, in-game currency, and much more.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you a disappointed PlayStation or Xbox user who was looking forward to Fragpunk’s console release? Do you think the level of compensation is enough when PC players get a huge advantage? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>
