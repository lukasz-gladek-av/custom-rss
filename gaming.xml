            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1’s Community Vote 2 is now live, and players can choose between Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms for the next major update. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 developers are building the game for the community, hosting new community votes for every upcoming major update. In the last vote, players had the option to choose between Rival Cartels, Police Expansion, and Shrooms, and after the voting period was over, the update finally arrived in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2025</a>. Now, a second round of voting has begun for new features in Schedule 1. </p>







<p>From <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546744790793847544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a>, September 1, to the upcoming weekend, Schedule 1 players will be able to participate in Community Vote 2 through the game’s main menu. The results will be announced shortly after the voting period is over, and they will also be displayed in the main menu. </p>



<h4 id="h-shrooms-return">Shrooms Return </h4>



<p>The new community vote brings back Shrooms as an option. This feature will allow players to manufacture and distribute a new drug type, Magic Mushrooms. The update will feature the “funky new drug”, unique equipment, new effects, and a new supplier. </p>



<h4 id="h-fishing-minigame">Fishing Minigame</h4>



<p>One of the newer options in the community vote is Fishing, which will introduce a fishing minigame. If this option wins the vote, players will be able to “reel in fish (and maybe some other&nbsp;<em>special</em>&nbsp;items)” that can be sold at Randy’s Bait &amp; Tackle. Moreover, the update will introduce new ingredients and effects. </p>



<h4 id="h-hireable-drivers">Hireable Drivers</h4>



<p>Lastly, we have a feature focused on convenience in Schedule 1’s community vote, specifically for hireable drivers. If this feature wins the vote, players will be able to transport items between their properties, businesses, and dealers. Moreover, players can designate automatic transit routes and specify the required conditions (e.g., number of items in the vehicle) for a route to begin. The update will also bring some QOL improvements to the delivery system.</p>



<p>In other news, we are yet to hear more about Schedule 1’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port</a> since the update in April 2025. Which feature will you be voting for in Schedule 1’s community vote 2? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodlines-2-can-last-up-to-40-hours-say-dev-fabien-wasn%E2%80%99t-playable-until-two-years-ago.1285803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During my <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-qa-lot-subtleties-to-movement-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025 interview with the developers of Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2</a>, I was able to obtain details on the game's estimated length. According to Design Director Jey Hicks, there's quite a bit of side content:  </p>



<p><strong><em>Jey Hicks:</em></strong> <em>I can't say the exact numbers because right now we're trying to figure out exactly how long it is, because we've been adding in a bunch of new content recently, but currently our estimates are between people who are a fast player who doesn't do any of the additional content, maybe 20-25 odd hours and then up to potentially around 40 hours for more sort of completionists.</em></p>



<p>My conversation with the folks from The Chinese Room also revealed that Fabien, the Malkavian vampire stuck in Phyre's head, wasn't really playable until a couple of years ago. It was a decision that made Bloodlines 2 much better, according to Hicks and Narrative Director Ian Thomas.</p>



<p><em><strong>Ian Thomas:</strong> We did quite a big change later on, we had a lot of extra story we wanted to tell and we also wanted to introduce the Malkavian clan. Suddenly we went, what if the Malkavian was the character in Phyre's head? Suddenly, it really started to work, and we found that having the old vampire who has maybe lost their humanity to quite a big extent and doesn't connect to the humans, along with Fabian, who's fascinated by humans and is really interested in how the world work, it was a really nice pairing, and that just worked for us, along with a really good voice actor. Suddenly, Fabian was brought to life and they went okay, this is the right way to go. It's quite a late change and also a brave change, I think, from Paradox's case, because they said, yes, you're right. We do need to make this change, let's take the time to do it. We are very happy with that.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Jey Hicks:</strong> I think it was definitely a worthwhile decision to delay the game and make sure that people actually relate and enjoy the characters. We didn't want Fabian to be just another voice in your head sort of character.</em></p>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will launch on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Read my recent hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-qa-lot-subtleties-to-movement-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two New AMD Ryzen CPUs Spotted At Online Retailer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/two-new-amd-ryzen-cpus-spotted-at-online-retailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-new-amd-ryzen-cpus-spotted-at-online-retailer.1285800/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It looks like AMD is getting ready to add two CPUs to its current-gen Ryzen lineup. Spotted at an online retailer, the AMD Ryzen 5 9500F and Ryzen 7 9700F are new processors seemingly launching in the coming weeks or months.</p>



<p>Both are Granite Ridge CPUs for the AM5 socket, meaning that they will work with current AM5-compatible motherboards.</p>



<p>While full details on the new CPUs aren’t yet known, some specifications have surfaced. According to online listings, the Ryzen 5 9500F is <a href="https://www.shopblt.com/item/amd-100-000001406-ryzen-5-9500f-6/amd_100000001406.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to feature</a> <strong>6 cores and 12 threads</strong>, with a maximum clock speed of 5.0 GHz. It will reportedly include <strong>38MB of cache</strong> and a <strong>65W TDP</strong>.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 7 9700F, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.shopblt.com/item/amd-100-000001902-ryzen-7-9700f-8/amd_100000001902.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is listed</a> as an <strong>8-core, 12-thread CPU</strong> with a <strong>65W TDP</strong>. Neither processor will include integrated graphics, as indicated by the “F” designation.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-pc-parts-nvidia-cuts-prices-of-rtx-50-series-gpus-in-europe">More PC Parts: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cuts-prices-of-rtx-50-series-gpus-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia Cuts Prices Of RTX 50-Series GPUs In Europe</a></h6>



<p>As far as pricing goes, that remains up in the air. Shop BLT has the AMD Ryzen 5 9500F lists for $217 while the Ryzen 7 9700F is priced at $294. That said, with the state of the market and changes happening, seemingly, daily, no pricing information can be viewed as certain.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while these retail listings may be accurate, the specifications are not confirmed. Until AMD provides official details, all of this information should be taken with a grain of salt. As of publishing, AMD has no events scheduled to announce its new processors.</p>



<p>AMD hasn’t responded to requests for comment on the new CPUs or when consumers can expect to see them released. Should a response come in, this article will be updated.</p>

<p>The updated version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> followed on from the snazzy Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game released in July, the (similarly) laboriously titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>, adding some bespoke new stuff into the brilliant base game along with the resolution and frame rate upgrades you'd expect.</p>
<p>PJ gave <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Star-Crossed World</a> a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">in his review</a>. It's perhaps Kirby's finest game, now even bigger and better. What's not to like? Besides the $80 price tag, of course. It's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 83</a> as of today, so it seems it's doing something right.</p>

<p>Have you picked up the upgrade? Or have you, like one Jim Norman of Nintendo Life, jumped into the Forgotten Land for the first time on Switch 2? We're keen to hear what score you'd award this latest NS2 Edition. Remember, if you haven't played it yet, you can return at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, or adjust your score if you change your mind.</p>

            <p>NetEase have shut down T-Minus Zero Entertainment, a studio founded in 2023 by former BioWare developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> executive producer Rich Vogel.</p>
<p>The studio had been working on an online multiplayer sci-fi action game, with contributions from a number of ex-BioWare and Bethesda staff including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> design lead Mark Tucker and senior producer Scott Malone. However, that project and T-Minus Zero Entertainment's on-going existence are not a good fit for "current market conditions".</p><!--more-->
<p>Vogel announced the end of NetEase's partnership with T-Minus in a LinkedIn post on 26th August. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-shuts-down-rich-vogel-led-t-minus-zero-entertainment">Game Developer</a> have now obtained confirmation that the studio has been closed down, in the absence of other funding.</p>
<p>"Every journey has its twists and turns, and ours with NetEase is coming to an end," Vogel writes in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/t-minus-zero-entertainment_an-update-on-t-minus-zero-every-journey-activity-7365874626570170369-U_ZD/">the LinkedIn statement</a>. "We deeply appreciate NetEase for providing us with both ample runway and support - from helping us find potential investors to giving us the time and budget to develop our game into a fully playable hands-on demo. It has generated a lot of interest. However, despite this progress, current market conditions have prevented us from securing the funding we need at this time."</p><p>Vogel goes on to celebrate his team's "dedication and passion" adding that "now may not be the best time to seek funding given today's climate, but our playable demo proves our potential to develop something fresh and exciting that will resonate with players for years."</p>
<p>As Game Developer report, senior NetEase staff have commented on the post to praise the bygone studio's work, with former NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu commenting that the prototype "delivers [the] great fantasy of fighting against 15th floor kaiju to protect the city you care about" while NetEase head of brand/publishing for North America &amp; Europe Cisco Maldonado called it a "super great concept and [in my opinion] a solid market fit".</p>
<p>Approached for comment, a NetEase spokesperson told Game Developer that "this decision was made with careful consideration, as we have been inspired by our partnership with the studio and their bold vision. However, we have had to reassess our business priorities and are now working closely with the studio to provide support and explore next steps."</p>
<p>NetEase have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">cutting staff and projects recently</a>, after investing in several studios founded by big names in the triple-A business. Last November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">called time on Worlds Untold</a>, a studio founded by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> writer Mac Walters. In January this year, they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">did likewise for Jar Of Sparks</a>, the studio founded by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook. In February, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">trimmed down the Marvel Rivals development team</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">made layoffs at Liquid Swords</a>, the studio founded by Avalanche co-founder Christofer Sundberg.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all the former T-Minus Zero Entertainment employees now looking for a safe port. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocksteady-hires-former-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-director-for-same-role.1285779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rocksteady is looking at the head of a popular franchise to guide its next game into the future. According to his personal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-money-1583b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn profile</a>, Bill Money has been working as game director at Rocksteady Studios since July 2025.</p>



<p>He joins the studio after spending 10 years at Ubisoft Singapore in the same role. </p>



<p>During his time with Ubisoft, Money led Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Valhalla, it’s Siege of Paris DLC, and Origins. Prior to Ubisoft, he was a creative director at Darkside Game Studios and a design director at WB Games Montreal. At WB Games, Money worked on Batman: Arkham Origins.</p>



<p>While it hasn’t been confirmed what game Money will be directing, it’s believed to be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio’s next Batman game</a>. Rocksteady hasn’t released a mainline Batman game since 2015’s Batman: Arkham Knight. Since then, they released Batman: Arkham VR for PC and PS4 in 2016 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in 2023. </p>



<p>Earlier this year the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off an unknown number</a> of staff as support for Suicide Squad wrapped up.</p>



<p>As far as Batman is concerned, Warner Bros. has gone on the record multiple times stating that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was going to focus on its biggest IPs</a> moving forward. The next Batman game, whenever that comes, isn’t the only Batman title coming, either. LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</a>, and is expected to release sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>What do you think the future of Batman games holds, and do you think Money is a good choice to lead the next game as director at Rocksteady? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Coming September 4, whatever it is.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has issued a bizarre in-universe tease — with a date set for September 4, later this week. The message has since prompted an array of fan theories — and debates over the franchise's canon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This afternoon, a message for New United States of America (N.U.S.A.) citizens posted by President Rosalind Myers appeared on the game's social media channels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dated September 4, 2025, three days from now, the post asks for "brave netruners" to help defend the N.U.S.A. from a "mounting cybersecurity threat" by taking some kind of recruitment test. What exactly this all means, however, has left fans uncertain. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, some fans are wondering whether the message — which of course in reality has come from CD Projekt Red — has gone live several days early, and whether it was meant to point to some kind of early sign-up for information on Cyberpunk 2. Or maybe the message is appearing now to trail something happening on September 4, and this is the start of some kind of ARG?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the fact that, well, this is an in-universe message from President Rosalind Myers — who doesn't become president until 2065. (As Cyberpunk fans have quickly pointed out, the current president should be Elizabeth Kress.) Has Myers figured out how to send a message back in time? Is this a retconning of the franchise's established lore? Or is this simply just a fun message from CD Projekt that fans shouldn't be reading this much into? Well, if it's the latter, it's already too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the Cyberpunk <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1n5plxz/important_message_for_nusa_citizens_from/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, fan speculation on what to expect later this week ranges from details of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-codename-orion">Cyberpunk 2</a>, more information on the already-announced Cyberpunk 2077 iPhone port, fresh news on the new anime spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2">Edgerunners 2</a>, or yet more content for Cyberpunk 2077 — which is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/despite-laying-off-270-staff-development-studio-virtuos-remains-fully-committed-to-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-cyberpunk-2077-and-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">still being worked on by support studio Virtuos</a>, even as the bulk of CD Projekt knuckles down on The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk's sequel.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Important message for N.U.S.A.

Citizens September 4, 2025</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Our great nation is once again facing a mounting cybersecurity threat — from those who hide in the shadows, too cowardly to publicly proclaim their beliefs, who are viciously determined to tear down our flag and the values it upholds. I will not accept this, and I know you won't either. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The N.U.S.A. is seeking brave netrunners to join our efforts and overcome this grave threat. Our brave agents work tirelessly to keep our country secure, maintain its dominance, and defend it from those so eager to undermine it. Now you can join us in our fight for freedom. I personally welcome all who believe they have what it takes. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Take our recruitment test. Prove yourself. Serve the N.U.S.A. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have pointed to the fact that Cyberpunk 2's associate game director Paweł Sasko has also shared the post, suggesting this has indeed gone live at the right time and is pointing to something to do with the game series itself. Others have also noted that Cyberpunk 2077 is, somehow, already approaching its fifth anniversary in December — a milestone CD Projekt may now be planning to celebrate in some fashion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contacted for more detail by IGN this afternoon, CD Projekt declined to comment on what might be in store. Here's hoping later this week brings more answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-next-may-cost-twice-as-much-as-playstation-6-due-to-magnus-apu-and-third-party-stores-support-xbox-pcs-won%E2%80%99t-support-backward-compatibility.1285740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox next-generation system could cost significantly more than the PlayStation 6 due to the Magnus APU and the potential support of third-party stores that would deprive Microsoft of the 30% cut on every game sold on the system.</p>



<p>Commenting on the next-generation system on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 reiterated that the leaked AMD Magnus APU will power<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-dockable-handheld-leak-amd-canis-specs-crush-xbox-ally-x.1687683/#post-270751455"> both the console and a line of gaming PCs</a>, adding that, contrary to speculation, only the console will support backward compatibility with previous-generation Xbox games, mostly due to <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-dockable-handheld-leak-amd-canis-specs-crush-xbox-ally-x.1687683/#post-270751551">publishers not being okay with an Xbox game license getting turned into a PC game license</a>. Outside of a legal grey area of a potential Xbox/Windows dual boot, Microsoft will likely have no way to get Xbox backward compatible games on PC. </p>



<p>On the other hand, the Xbox next-generation system <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-dockable-handheld-leak-amd-canis-specs-crush-xbox-ally-x.1687683/#post-270751551">supporting Steam and GOG games</a> shouldn't have legal issues, and should be feasible on a technical level by running the game inside a virtual machine. However, supporting third-party stores on the system will likely cause the price of the console to be significantly higher than the PlayStation 6, possibly around double, as Microsoft will need to sell the system at a profit without the 30% cut on every game sold on the system and with the added cost of the Magnus APU, which is reportedly a very large APU.</p>



<p>Though obviously unconfirmed, the Xbox next-generation system costing more than the PlayStation 6 is becoming less surprising, especially after the first details on the AMD Magnus APU <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">leaked online</a>. This big APU with a chiplet design will provide Microsoft with a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">flexibility to produce a wide range of systems</a> that will likely compete with pre-built gaming PCs rather than other consoles like the PlayStation 6 and Nintendo Switch 2. Sony, on the other hand, is reportedly heading towards a different direction aimed at delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">4K, 120 FPS capable system with significant ray tracing performance uplifts</a> while keeping costs down, alongside a portable system which is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">easily outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X and even the base PlayStation 5 </a>with games patched to take advantage of the console's capabilities. As such, with these diverse approaches, the next generation of consoles promises to be one of the most interesting in years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In need of expanding your PC storage space? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/">Samsung is here to help with a series of SSDs at various capacities all on sale for Labor Day.</a> <strong>The Samsung 990 EVO Plus</strong> with 1TB of space has been chopped down by 38% which brings it from $105 to just $65 — saving you $40. If 1TB isn’t enough for you, the 2TB SSD dropped 32% from $177 to just $120 — saving $57. Still not enough? Alright, alright. Well you can boost your storage space up to 4TB. This highest capacity model of the Samsung 990 EVO Plus is discounted 27% from $328 to only $240. That’s a savings of $88. Game file sizes just continue going up and up so you can set yourself up for a long while with four full terabytes.</p>
<p>This PC-ready SSD can keep up with all your gaming needs with its super fast read and write speeds. It can handle read speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s with writes speeds of up to 6,300 MB/s.

            <p>
Kojima Productions has announced a 10th anniversary celebration to be held in Japan, which promises guest appearances and "a glimpse into future projects".
</p>
<p>
The studio unveiled the event today, on the 10th anniversary of Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, which doesn't seem coincidental.
</p>
<p>
The Kojima Productions Beyond The Strand event will take place on 23rd September at a cinema in Tokyo, but it doesn't appear to be screened elsewhere. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> himself will host the event.

<p>
Still, keep that date in your diaries if you're interested to know what's coming next from the studio.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we'll see something on OD, Kojima's Xbox horror game first announced back in 2023? In a recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">Kojima stated OD was "something totally different"</a> and people will either "love it or hate it".
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps we'll see a first look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Physint</a>, Kojima's return to the action-espionage genre he popularised with the Metal Gear Solid games. Then again, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">recently stated it's early enough in development he's still working on it by himself</a>.
</p>
<p>
Just don't expect Death Stranding 3 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-wont-make-it-himself">Kojima confirmed he has a concept for a sequel</a>, but won't be making it himself.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details about the 2022 Saints Row reboot have surfaced online, suggesting that the game was originally intended to be a sequel to Saints Row: The Third. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a Saints Row reboot was released in 2022, developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. The game featured a brand-new story and characters, featuring a crime-based adventure in Santo Ileso. However, fans of the series were not happy with this direction, with many expressing disappointment over the shift in tone and the narrative’s lack of substance. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-2022-saints-row-reboot-could-have-been">What the 2022 Saints Row Reboot Could Have Been</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The details about the Saints Row reboot originally being a sequel come from mrsaintsgodzilla21’s video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZfzp0NrM4Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via Synth Potato on <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1962204453500551604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>). In this video, the creator discusses their 2019 visit to Volition’s development studio, highlighting every detail, story point, or other aspect that was cut or changed during the transition from a sequel to a reboot. The game was to be called ‘Saints Row Cinco” and would arrive as a direct sequel to Saints Row: The Third. </p>



<p>To make the Saints Row sequel a possibility, they would have to retcon all events from Saints Row 4 and even negate Johnny Gat’s death in the third installment. So, instead of an alien invasion, the Saints, along with The Boss, would have to exit Steelport and establish a new base in Santo Ileso. The sequel would have also featured all the Original Saint Members as the main characters in the sequel. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers intended to make this a fan service game, checking off all the things they had requested over the years. The Saints Row sequel would follow a 20/80 rule for its tone, where 20% of it would be inspired by Saints Row 3 and 80% by Saints Row 2. There was also a secret mission in the game, where players would have the chance to confront and kill Dex. The Saints Row sequel was so far in development that Pierce’s actor had recorded some of the lines for it, too. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-things-started-to-change">When Things Started to Change</h2>



<p>Things reportedly changed as soon as THQ Nordic acquired Deep Silver, with the former outright rejecting the sequel idea and forcing Volition to go back to the drawing board. For the new story, heavy restrictions were placed on what the characters would be able to say, including swear words. Then, a new version of the reboot was pitched, which would have retained all the original Saints; however, that was rejected by THQ Nordic as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-other-features-that-could-have-been-a-part-of-the-saints-row-sequel">Other Features That Could Have Been a Part of the Saints Row Sequel </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other cancelled and rejected features for the Saints Row sequel were also revealed. Ultor was going to return instead of the Marshals, with the Skill Tree being split into wealth, fame, and muscle branches. Body shields were also going to return, but Deep Silver rejected them for being “too violent.” Criminal Ventures would have allowed players to customize the entire city, choosing what businesses to place in the open world. </p>



<p>They also had a ‘proclamation’ system, which allowed players to instill laws in districts under their control. These laws would vary from setting dress codes to enacting standoffs as a method of resolving conflicts. The game was also bringing back Cribs and customisation, where players could customise cribs and the church and place items where they wished. You could also purchase furniture from the store, but these features were cut. </p>



<p>Moreover, cheats would have been unlocked during the endgame, requiring players to find and unlock a massive secret genki pyramid to make them available. Also, New Game+ was cut. There are a lot more details in mrsaintsgodzilla21’s video, which you can find embedded below. Readers should note that as these details do not come from an official source, they should treat it with caution. </p>

<p>Once you’re done with Borderlands 4’s main content, the roadmap shows us what’s coming later on. We can see what 2K has planned in terms of DLC and all the extra content coming to the looter shooter.</p>



<p>We’re seeing roadmaps announced in advance quite regularly. It gives you an incentive to invest in a game, as you know more content is arriving post-launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> senses this, and it’s why 2K has gone early with a look at the game’s full roadmap of content arriving in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>If you want to see Borderlands 4’s roadmap and future plans, you’re in the right space, fellow Vault Hunter.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-upcoming-borderlands-4-content">All Upcoming Borderlands 4 Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shut your Claptrap. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>2K has indicated that Borderlands 4’s roadmap includes free and paid DLC, new story content, fresh gear, skins, bosses, events, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>To make this more digestible, I’ve whipped up a quick table so you can see the individual additions to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and if they’ll cost you anything.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">New Borderlands 4 Roadmap Content</th><th data-align="center">If It’s Free Or Paid DLC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Normal Bosses</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(<strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cosmetics</td><td data-align="center">Free DLC</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">ECHO-4 Drone Skins</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong><strong>(Story Pack &amp; <strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">ECHO-4 Frame</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong><strong>(Story Pack &amp; <strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">&nbsp;Invincible Bosses</td><td data-align="center">Free DLC</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Legendary Weapons</td><td data-align="center">Free DLC &amp; Paid DLC</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Main Missions</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(Story Pack &amp; <strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Region of Kairos</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(Story Pack)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Player Skin</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(<strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Seasonal Mini-Events (Horrors of Kairos is first)</td><td data-align="center">Free DLC</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Side Missions</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(Story Pack)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level</td><td data-align="center">Free DLC</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault Card</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(<strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault Hunter</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(Story Pack)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault Hunter Skins</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(Story Pack)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(<strong>Bounty Pack</strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Skins</td><td data-align="center">Paid DLC <strong>(Story Pack)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weather Variants</td><td data-align="center">Free DLC</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-roadmap-release-window-explained">Borderlands 4 Roadmap Release Window Explained</h2>



<p><strong>We’re not sure when the majority of this new Borderlands 4 content is coming, but the official roadmap indicates the Horrors of Kairos Seasonal Mini-Event begins in October.</strong></p>



<p>2K hasn’t revealed the dates of release windows for the majority of the announced roadmap content yet. ‘Horrors of Kairos’ will likely tie into the spooky and kooky nature of Halloween. I’d also say it’s a safe bet that we’ll get some kind of Christmas-themed Borderlands 4 seasonal event, too.</p>



<p>The Story Pack and Bounty Pack content—which come with upgraded Borderlands 4 editions—are currently TBA. However, I’d expect 2K to give us more insight closer to the game’s full launch.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that there will be a State of Play taking place on September 3rd, with the sole focus of the show being IO Interactive’s 007 First Light. The State of Play will last 30 minutes and will feature the development team, who will reveal new gameplay and dive into what player can expect when they play the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fgtpwEMPM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>007 First Light is set right at the start of James Bond’s career as a 00 agent, with his first mission seemingly pitting him against 009. 009 appears to have gone rogue and has their own plans, which cannot come to fruition. The announcement trailer showed some gameplay, which had some hallmarks of the Hitman games like taking down guards. The 007 First Light State of Play will surely go much further into how you will infiltrate places and sneak around as Bond, as well as detail the weapons and gadgets that will be available to you.</p>
<p>The 007 First Light State of Play will start 11am PT / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST on September 3rd. 007 First Light is expected to release in 2026 for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to an upcoming <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/">State of Play</a> from PlayStation (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/state-of-play-confirmed-for-3rd-september-deep-dive-on-007-first-light">Push Square</a>), we're getting our first proper deep dive into the title's gameplay later this week on <strong>Wednesday, 3rd September</strong>.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the footage showcased in the State of Play won't be representative of the game on Switch 2. IO's recent port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> wasn't exactly the gold standard in terms of performance, with the game struggling to hit its 60fps target for the majority of the time. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hitman-world-of-assassination-updated-on-switch-2-here-are-the-patch-notes">A recent patch</a> introduced a new option to lock the frame rate at 30fps, making for a generally more pleasant experience.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3wrkuxi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Performance concerns aside, though, we're fully expecting First Light on Switch 2 to be on par with other platforms when it comes to features and gameplay. The showcase itself will last for more than 30 minutes, and will feature "a playthrough of Bond’s first mission as an MI6 recruit. The action includes everything from high-speed car chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts".</p>
<p>It all kicks off at <strong>11am PT / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>, and we'll be sure to keep you up to speed on any significant announcements that the livestream may bring.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-event-later-this-month-promises-a-glimpse-into-future-projects.1285704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A look at future Kojima Productions games will be provided later this month during the studio's 10th anniversary celebrations.</p>



<p>As revealed today on the Japanese development studio's <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand">official website</a>, a special event called Beyond The Strand will take place at TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Tokyo on September 23. The event will celebrate the development studio's 10th anniversary and feature special guest appearances as well as a glimpse into future projects. Tickets for the event will go on <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">sale</a> tomorrow, September 2, at 10:00 AM JST and will only be available via advanced reservation. Live stream details will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>Though we haven't seen much of what Kojima Productions is currently working on, we know the development studio headed by Hideo Kojima is working on the OD project with Microsoft and on Physint in collaboration with Sony. Following a slew of cancelled projects at Microsoft, the future of OD seemed uncertain, but it was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">confirmed</a> that development would continue on a project that will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">very different from anything else on the market and quite divisive</a>. Physint, on the other hand, seems to be very far from release, as the game that will bring back Hideo Kojima to the stealth genre is still in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/">conceptual phase.</a></p>



<p>Kojima Productions' latest game is Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Released in June on PlayStation 5, the second entry in the series is a much more cohesive package than its predecessor and the culmination of some of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review.</a></p>

        <p>I swear, it's always been like this you s'wit</p>

            <p>Remember when, back in the day, you made the trek through the ashlands to Red Mountain? Within, you encountered an unforgettable foe. "Come, Nerevar. Friend or traitor, come. Come and look upon the Heart, and Akulakhan. And bring Wraithguard... I have need of it", they said. "Heed my words. I am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a>. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat."</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe not, but it's a nice image with which to open the news that a modder's managed to port the entirety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>'s landmass into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's still very much a work-in-progress, as you might expect given its version of Vvardenfell's populated by copies of the same random woman and goats, but it certainly makes for a surreal watch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Morrowind is one of my favorite games of all-time, but god damn is it dated," the modder in question, YouTuber InfernoPlus, explained in video showing off their Elden Scrolls. "So, my goal here is to try and combine the world and lore of Morrowind with the combat of a Souls game. Basically, just taking the best parts of both and slapping them together into a common fruit and scrib jelly sandwich."</p>
<p>The result so far is a really cool re-creation of all the locations you remember from Morrowind, rendered with the extra fidelity and weather effects possible in the engine of a modern FromSoft game. You can wander through the streets of Balmora, gaze out at the ghost fence from Red Mountain, and even pop by Vivec to dick around on its namesake's favourite hovering spot.</p><p>You won't find the Warrior-Poet there though, nor any other Dunmer, Argonians or other Elder Scrolls races across the landscape of Dagoth Souls though. As I mentioned, InfernoPlus has stuck clones of a generic Elden Ring lady in as placeholders for humanoid NPCs, with goats serving the same role for every creature. These mysterious women, who one can only assume are evidence of Divayth Fyr getting up to even more daughter-clone-siring than in the base game, do have written dialogue, but only speak the sound of a page turning. They all also assume the player's already dealt with Dagoth Ur, which is probably why they look to be in happier spirits than the game's usual insult-spitting blue blokes.</p>
<p>"I've done a fair bit of research on what remaining work is left, and from what I can tell, everything I want to do is possible," the modder explains later on the video. "It really just comes down to the number of hours it's going to take to build it all out."</p>
<p>Interestingly, he notes that he tried cramming Morrowind into both the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> before turning to Eddie Rang, because it'd come without the headache of being close to the world-loading restrictions. He's also not worried about any Lionel Hutzes from Bethesda or FromSoftware potentially seeing one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo0nuQCq10w">couple of videos</a> he's now posted about the mod, declaring that "this project does not violate any copyright whatsoever".</p>
<p>If, or when, this mod makes it to release, InfernoPlus adds that it'll work a bit like the <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/">Tale of Two Wastelands</a> mod which merges <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> into one experience that allows you to travel between the two games' worlds. As such, you'll need to own a copy of Morrowind and a copy of Elden Ring to give it a go.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-samsung-odyssey-alienware-clears-out-its-34-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-at-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day.1285692/</guid>

              <p>If you haven’t ever used a curved monitor, it may feel like it’s just a gimmick. As an curved display gamer myself, I can assure you it’s so much more. When sitting at the right angle and distance, the curvature really sucks you in. Prices have been coming down over the pas few years too so they’re really not too much to add to your gaming desk. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3840/">The Alienware 34 curved gaming monitor right now is 20% off too. It’s listed on Amazon at $400, but with the discount, it comes down to just $320.</a> That’s an extra $80 you get to keep in your bank account.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3840/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Gamers</h2>
<p>The Alienware monitor measures in at a massive 34 inches. It’s ultra-wide and comes in at a curvature of 1500R. This better reflects the way we perceive our surroundings through our eyes. Our environment isn’t just in front of us, it’s all around us. As overused as the term has becomes, a curved display like this one really does allow your gaming to feel more immersive.</p>
<p>The display is working with a QHD resolution of 1440p and maximum refresh rate of 180 Hz. You can expect smooth and clear responsive gameplay with a low response time of 1ms. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync help improve performance and eliminate screen tearing while you game.</p>
<p>I think we all know at this point staring at a bright screen for hours on end isn’t exactly&nbsp;<em>good</em> for you. If you like to marathon gaming session, the Alienware curved display comes with hardware-based tools in its dedicated console to limit blue light. This can help reduce eyestrain during those long hours of play or work while still preserving a wide depth of color.</p>



<p>Breaking down the various ports and slots, along the read you’ll find two HDMI ports along with one DisplayPort. This will let you connect multiple sources to your Alienware monitor at once. You can use it primarily for your gaming PC but also choose to hook up a console like your Nintendo Switch 2. Just hop between input instead of having to disconnect and rearrange anything on your desk. The display also has two USB-A ports. The display makes cable management simple in its stand design.</p>
<p>Speaking of the stand, it’s fully adjustable. Raise and lower it or tilt the screen toward you with ease. The footprint base is small to save space on your desk despite the massive size of the screen itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3840/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Alienware 34 curved gaming monitor for just $320.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-links-wifi-7-gaming-router-hits-warp-speed-savings-even-cheaper-than-last-labor-day-2000621428</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tp-link%E2%80%99s-wifi-7-gaming-router-hits-warp-speed-savings-even-cheaper-than-last-labor-day.1285677/</guid>

              <p>A faster router means faster online gaming — that’s simple. But what would you call the effect that <strong>the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router</strong> will have on your gaming when it opens up the data floodgates with three bands delivering 19Gbps and the Wi-Fi 7 top speed of 320MHz, all driven by a quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM for ultimate capacity and strength of connections? You’ll have to come up with your own superlatives after you <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/">head to Amazon and grab this elite-level gaming router for just $370 — a limited-time 38% price drop from its regular $600.</a></p>
<p>What do all of those features translate to? Wi-Fi 7 is nearly 5x faster than even Wi-Fi 6E, and the main 6Hz band has double the width of a 5Hz band and thus allows double the speed — think of the speeds you can reach on an 8-lane highway as opposed to a 4-lane road. (Although we would never, ever advocate that you try something so illegal.) And the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router is compatible with EasyMesh routers and range extenders, so its incredible speed and capacity are equally accessible throughout your home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Lag Killer</h2>
<p>Latency, for the uninitiated, is what drags your online speed into the gutter, causing your game to lag and stutter and tear. Anyone who’s ever been in the middle of a FPS or other intense action game where speed and reaction time are critical and suddenly been frozen just long enough to get killed off is all too familiar with latency. The TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router is one of the best lag eradicators around, with 4x lower latency than even a fast Wi-Fi 6/6E router.</p>
<p>As if that’s not enough to ensure a blistering-fast, nearly flawless connection for games, the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router can automatically detect and optimize gaming streams and give them a boost with QoS (Quality of Service). There is also a dedicated Gaming Port at the rear of the router to give you the option of hardwiring for absolute max performance, and an accelerated search for game servers to find the shortest, fastest path.</p>



<h2>Future-Proofed</h2>
<p>There’s always a natural reluctance to go big on the “latest and greatest” tech device, because they evolve at such speed that there will be a new “latest and greatest” before you know it. But the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router has included two 10Gbps WAN ports for that faster-than-fiber connection. There’s nothing on the horizon that’s going to outgun the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router for a long time.</p>
<p>If you’re still slugging it out with a slow router and practically crushing your controller with your bare hands out of frustration when your game freezes or glitches right in the middle of an intense battle, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/">this Amazon limited-time deal dropping the price of the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router to just $370 is tailor-made for you.</a> Years of the fastest possible no-lag gaming connection is just a click away.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-celebrating-10th-anniversary-with-%E2%80%98future-projects%E2%80%99-glimpse.1285674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kojima Productions has announced an upcoming showcase poised to celebrate the company’s tenth anniversary. The ‘Beyond the Strand’ event will offer a ‘glimpse into future projects’ and pay tribute to everything the studio has accomplished thus far.</p>



<p>Beyond the Strand will be both a digital and in-person event, with the live portion taking place at TOHO Cinemas in Roppongi Hills, Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-ten-years-of-kojima-productions">Ten Years of Kojima Productions</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima will host the Beyond the Strand event in Japan on September 23, and the showcase is set to feature a hefty assortment of special guest appearances. It’s easy to predict who will show up, and I’m willing to bet hard cash that Norman Reedus will appear.</p>



<p>Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unveiled the event</a> earlier today, revealing that tickets for Beyond the Strand will go on sale from tomorrow, September 2.</p>



<p>In the most recent Hideo Kojima space, the iconic game creator revealed that he’s effectively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working ‘all by himself’</a> on Physint, the tactical espionage game set to be a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Before that, he stressed in a somewhat bizarre way during an interview that, while making games, he has learned many ways in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-learned-many-ways-kill-people-bags-studios/">which to kill people</a>. It was his opinion that more developers need to understand these elements of development if they want to make better games.</p>



<p> Looking forward to Beyond the Strand, it’s easy to see a heavy focus on OD, one of Hideo Kojima’s next big games. There might even be talk of an expansion for Death Stranding 2. As for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 3</a>, the man himself recently admitted that it might not be him who makes the game, if it does ever surface.</p>



<p>What do you want to see at Beyond the Strand? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
