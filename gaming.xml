			<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor looks utterly stunning at 8K resolution with a few mods, including one that improves the visuals consistently.</p>
<p>A new video put together by Beyond Dreams shows the second entry in the series developed by Respawn running at 8K resolution with mods like Ultra +, which, similarly to the mod developed for Hogwarts Legacy, improves effects such as water effects, lighting, and textures. Further improving the game's visuals is the Complete RT shader by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NiceGuy</a>, an advanced screen space ray tracing shader that lets users add global illumination with effects like Diffuse Illumination and Specular Reflection, ambient occlusion, and glossy reflections to any game. You can check out the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] Star Wars Jedi Survivor: Close to Realism!! RayTracing Mod - Complete RT - Ultra Plus 100+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5Q119g8gfo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While mods have improved Star Wars Jedi Survivor visuals, none have managed to improve its performance, which still leaves a lot to be desired even after multiple patches. It is a shame the game does not run well on any platform, as it is a definite step forward over its predecessor in every possible way, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It will eventually launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-rated-for-playstation-4-xbox-one/">PlayStation 4 and Xbox One</a> as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-resident-evil-in-the-works-with-the-man-responsible-for-reinventing-the-series-at-the-helm.917061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190672/resident-evil-9-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ZRSMkQ">The next mainline Resident Evil game is in development, game director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed Monday in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQnubIc5cs&amp;t=383s">a video streamed by Capcom</a>.</p>
<p id="bZcuFy">Nakanishi was the director of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/23/14287196/resident-evil-7-review-re7-vii-biohazard-ps4-playstation-4-vr-psvr-pc-windows-xbox-one-capcom"><em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/5/24/4361030/resident-evil-revelations-review-secret-weapon"><em>Resident Evil: Revelations</em></a>, and also served as a designer on <em>Resident Evil 5</em>. In other words, Nakanishi’s games have both steered Resident Evil back toward its horror roots, while also trying to reinvent the franchise in important ways.</p>
<p id="ExIkjl">In confirming the new Resident Evil, Nakanishi said, “It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [<em>Resident Evil 7</em>]. But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial.” Nakanishi said he couldn’t say more about the next game, the follow-up to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22420808/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x-one-ps4"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>, but hoped that fans will look forward to its official reveal.</p>
<div id="1NEVAe"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmQnubIc5cs?rel=0&amp;start=383" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Y3QPQ5">2017’s <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</em> was a major turn for the franchise, shifting the action from third-person to first-person and introducing a new playable protagonist, Ethan Winters. <em>Village</em>, released in 2021, is said by Capcom to be the end of the Winters family saga, meaning <em>Resident Evil 9</em> will likely feature the return of a classic Resident Evil hero or another brand-new character.</p>
<p id="zLedY0">The most recent entry in Capcom’s survival horror franchise was last year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23643823/resident-evil-4-remake-review-capcom-ps5">remake of <em>Resident Evil 4</em></a>, which starred Leon S. Kennedy. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23891490/resident-evil-4-remake-dlc-review-separate-ways"><em>Separate Ways</em> add-on</a> starring Ada Wong was released for <em>RE4</em> in September 2023. </p>
<p id="N38H8r">Capcom is reported to have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-at-capcom">multiple Resident Evil projects in development</a>, including remakes of <em>Resident Evil Zero</em> and <em>Code Veronica</em>. There’s no official release window for <em>Resident Evil 9</em>, but given Capcom’s recent cadence of releasing a sequel or remake every other year, we could see the next Resident Evil as early as 2025.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYzTOfAlKTc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, UNIVRS confirmed that Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable will launch into Early Access on July 23, 2024.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aotvrub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> includes a small roadmap, which teases that the full release is still planned for “later 2024.” Since Early Access arrives in late July, the full launch will likely end up in Q4.</p>



<p>The Chapter 1 &amp; 2 Early Access version will be available for $4.99, “with update support alongside the 1.0 release.”</p>



<p>The roadmap adds that the 1.0 build release will include more chapters and a co-op mode at regular pricing. UNIVRS did not confirm the exact pricing for the full release, at this time.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>UNIVRS also invited fans to join the Discord launch in order to provide feedback during the Early Access period.</p>



<p>The devs describe Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable as a “3D Maneuvering Action-adventure game.” Players will “become a member of the Scout Regiment,” and even get to fly with Omni Directional Mobility Gear.</p>



<p>Today’s trailer showcased a variety of bloody combat and map traversal mechanics. It will clearly be as brutal as the source material. However, it’s unclear if the story will be original or follow existing beats from the beloved series.</p>



<p>Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable will be available on Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3. It will support both English and Japanese languages and voicing.</p>

<p>Nintendo is continuing to go after those it feels encourages and supports the piracy of its consoles and games. The company has filed more lawsuits against two parties in a Washington federal court. </p>



<p>As first discovered by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TorrentFreak</a>, Nintendo has filed two new suits. The first goes after Modded Hardware, specifically Ryan Daly who runs the group. The suit says that Nintendo asked Daly stop selling his modded hardware, but after he didn’t despite agreeing to do so, the company sued. According to the claims in the lawsuit, Nintendo says Modded Hardware sells various hardware that allows the Switch to play pirated copies of games.</p>



<p>The second lawsuit goes against James “Archbox” Williams. In this suit, Nintendo says Williams encourages piracy and is the “driving force” behind “several Pirate Shops”.</p>



<p>“Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights. Indeed, Defendant has bragged publicly that he is a ‘pirate’ who ‘[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game’,” Nintendo says in the filing.</p>



<p>They say that Williams has helped people get easier access to pirate games for the Switch, and was magnified due to the aforementioned SwitchPirates subreddit. Williams is a moderator of the subreddit.</p>



<p>With both lawsuits, damages aren’t mentioned by Nintendo directly. That said, it could lead to millions of dollars if history is any indication. Recently, the company had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular emulator YuZu shut down</a> after taking it to court. Yuzu developer Tropic Haze also agreed to a $2.4 million settlement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-galactic-trials-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro and publisher Outright Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials</em>, a new action-roguelite with racing elements that takes place in - you guessed it - the&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>
<p>Development is being handled by&nbsp;<em>Race with Ryan&nbsp;</em>studio 3DClouds, but don't let that discourage you; these are also the folks that made...erm...<em>Paw Patrol Grand Prix&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gigantosaurus Dino Kart</em>.</p>
<p>Still, maybe this one will make you happy if you're hankering for some&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>action. Launching on October 11th,&nbsp;<em>Galactic Trials&nbsp;</em>combines "arcade racing and robot combat" with some of the most iconic&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>characters going.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-galactic-trials-gameplay.jpg?itok=p9W-0ygI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-galactic-trials-gameplay.jpg?itok=5-oAlgNQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Transformers: Galactic Trials&nbsp;</em>combines arcade racing with roguelite action.</figcaption></figure><p>Characters available to play as include Optimus Prime (for what&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>game is complete without him?), as well as Megatron, Bumblebee, Elita-1, and many more.</p>
<p>Gameplay consists of racing along tracks in your Transformer's Alt mode before switching to Bot mode to engage in third-person combat, during which you'll battle other bots for supremacy.</p>
<p>Progressing through the game's main Galactic Trials mode will give you the chance to unlock relics and improve your characters' skills, as well as unlocking new characters and skins.</p>
<p>If you feel like simply jumping into a quick bout, however,&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials&nbsp;</em>also supports a two-player Arcade mode, which pits you against a friend in split-screen multiplayer.</p>

<p>This is far from the Transformers' first excursion into the world of video games. Notable previous efforts on this front include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/transformers-devastation-review-optimal-and-prime">Platinum's&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation</em></a>, a character action game with a focus on stylish combat (because, well, Platinum), as well as the 2023 shooter&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Earthspark - Expedition</em>.</p>
<p>Where exactly&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials&nbsp;</em>will land in the pantheon of&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>games remains to be seen, but we'll get to find out later this year.&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on October 11th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-needs-to-cancel-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-according-to-a-group-of-japanese-gamers.917007/</guid>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows needs to be canceled by Ubisoft, according to a group of Japanese gamers.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of Shadows</a> (previously dubbed&nbsp; Assassin's Creed: Red) back in May of this year, plenty of 'fans' took to social media to discuss Ubisoft's choice for the game's main protagonists. Not only has there been a vocal discussion about character representation, but a group of Japanese gamers also seemingly don't agree with the game's historical accuracy and the lack of cultural respect from Ubisoft. As a matter of fact, there's <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%89%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BA%E3%81%AE%E7%99%BA%E5%A3%B2%E4%B8%AD%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%92%E6%B1%82%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now a Japanese petition</a> on Charge.org that demands Ubisoft to cancel the title.</p>
<p>"Recently, a serious issue of historical accuracy and lack of cultural respect has been raised about game developer Ubisoft's upcoming release, Assassin's Creed Shadows", the creators of the petition write (roughly translated). "The game is based on the subject of Japanese samurai and ignores the fact that samurai are a higher class of samurai and should be "gokemono" or servants of nobility. In fact, the first European to receive the title of samurai, William Adams (Miura Anobori), was a bannerman with 250 koku and served Tokugawa Ieyasu. Throughout this history, Ubisoft continues to misunderstand the nature and role of the Samurai.</p>
<p>According to the group, this misunderstanding about the nature and role of the historical Samurai is a serious insult to Japanese history and culture, which could lead to Asian racism. "We demand that Ubisoft immediately stop the release of "Assassin's Creed Shadows" and show serious investigation and respect for Japanese history and culture", the group writes.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing, more the petition has over 28.300 signatures with the next goal being 35.000 signatures. Out of those 28.300, more than 13.500 people signed the petition today.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that this petition will have effect on the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows later this year, but it will be interesting to see how Ubisoft will handle this heavily-signed petition. We'll update you as soon as more about the game comes in.&nbsp; What are your thoughts about this petition? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is slated for a launch on November 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-smaller-origins-sized-map-not-all-of-japan-covered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will feature only a part of Japan, and will return to the map size as seen in Assassin's Creed: Origins</a>.</p>

<p>There is still life for Palia developer Singularity 6 as the studio has been purchased by Daybreak for an undisclosed amount. </p>



<p>“We are thrilled to welcome Singularity 6 to Daybreak Games,” said Ji Ham, CEO of Daybreak Games, <a href="https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/dbg-s6-acquisition-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a press release announcing</a> the deal. </p>



<p>“[Singularity 6] is an excellent addition to our development studios, renowned for their success in creating large-scale online games and content. Their debut title,&nbsp;Palia, is a fantastic addition to our online portfolio. We eagerly anticipate collaborating with the [Singularity 6] team to make&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>the best online experience possible across all major gaming platforms and to help continue expand their community of players for years to come.”</p>



<p>The acquisition comes a few months after Singularity 6 had to layoff a number of employees in April due to financial struggles within the studio. More layoffs were then held in May. </p>



<p>Still, Palia has continued to perform well for the company. According to the press release announcing the deal, Palia still sees over 100,000 daily active users.</p>



<p>Singularity 6 will become a subsidiary under Daybreak. Daybreak is known for other online games such as Planetside 2, DC Universe Online, Everquest, and more.</p>

		<p>The next Resident Evil game is in development and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7</a> director Koshi Nakanishi is seemingly leading the team behind it.</p>
<p>“It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7,” he said, “But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial.”</p>


<p>This absolutely sounds like the next Resident Evil will be another big reinvention for the long-running horror game series, though Nakanishi did not share any further details at this time. “I hope you’re excited for the day I can,” he said.</p>
<p>Koshi Nakanishi has a well-established place in the Resident Evil series, having been director for Mercenaries 3D and the first Resident Evil Revelations, as well as serving as lead designer on Resident Evil 5. He will, however, be most famous for leading development of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 7 was hugely impactful for the series, with its shift to first person action, the introduction of Ethan Winters as a new everyman protagonist, and a much less sensationalised setting than the previous mainline game. This was the built upon with Resident Evil Village, which concluded Ethan’s story. In and around those games, Capcom has also given fans of the classics plenty to enjoy, with ground-up remakes of Resident Evil 2, 3 and 4 that have modernised their gameplay.</p>

<p>That blend of new and old is rumoured to continue, with rumours of Resident Evil 9 development (or whatever it ends up being called) also coming alongside <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075103169954210">rumours of remakes for Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunnyside-review-buggy-but-absolutely-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sunnyside-review-buggy-but-absolutely-worth-it.916965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunnyside-review-buggy-but-absolutely-worth-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you thought you were done with cozy farming sims, think again – <em>SunnySide </em>takes everything people thought they knew and loved about the cozy farming genre and flips it on its head. Gone are the days when you’re watering individual plants with an outdated watering can. Welcome to 2024, where people can order their seeds online and text their friends to meet up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>SunnySide</em> is a modern twist on the farming simulation games that players know and love. Combining more in-depth mechanics of the <em>Farming Simulators</em> with the cozy classics like <em>Stardew Valley</em> lets developers RainyGames create a unique, standout game. Between stellar story-telling, farming/ranching, battling, and relationship-building, <em>SunnySide </em>has earned a spot in the genre for pushing things farther than anyone else has. There are so many little details all around that elevate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an abundance of bugs and performance issues make it incredibly difficult to get into. The game is held back from soaring as it should, but if you can get around them, there’s a truly special game waiting underneath.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Welcome to the SunnySide</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainy-day-bike-riding-in-sunnyside_0.jpg?itok=XIb48zXZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainy-day-bike-riding-in-sunnyside_0.jpg?itok=uZ8qr23o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>SunnySide&nbsp;</em>is visually stunning and has a lot of charm.</figcaption></figure><p>As a new resident in SunnySide, the player buys a nearly empty piece of land to start a farm on. The only thing available is a shed with a few tools, a water pump and hose, and a tent from the neighbor. The friendly townspeople are willing to help the player get set up for success, teaching them everything from cooking to woodworking to farming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little town feels alive – people are constantly walking everywhere, they’re changing clothes with the seasons, they have their own lives, and they aren’t relying on the player for anything. The characters are unique enough to stand out, both in design and personality. There’s every kind of store that a small town would have, and as someone who grew up in a small town, it feels like home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little details of the people and the town already set it apart. The way they interact with the player also feels genuine, along with how the player builds relationships with them. Getting close to people involves texting, meeting up anywhere around town, and spending time together. For each character, spending time together looks different; players can write poetry with Sebastion or fly drones with Hiro.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deck-combat-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=N5fR665b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deck-combat-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=dHLTTprp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battling with spiritually-charged talismen is another outstanding area of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>These interactions feel realistic, and getting to know the characters reveals that they’re written well, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also events pretty consistently, such as festival days or farmer’s markets where the player can interact with everyone as they come and go. Additionally, the farmer’s market is how players can sell anything they get their hands on in a way that still feels pretty realistic. If someone was trying to make a living off the land today, renting a booth and selling things would be a solid start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the game continues, players can make deals with townspeople to source different things for them. The natural progression of building both casual and business relationships is unmatched by other games in the genre.</p>
<h2>Deep farming mechanics</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/farming-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=tkci5C7x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/farming-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=m7IcWE_4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's so much freedom in&nbsp;<em>SunnySide&nbsp;</em>that players can choose what kind of farm they want to have. Pick a specialty or have a variety, it's up to you.</figcaption></figure><p>Starting from the literal bottom feels satisfying in a way that other cozy farming sims don’t point out. While you may have a dilapidated house in other games, at least it’s a house. And it’s easy enough to get a few pieces of wood to upgrade. In <em>SunnySide</em>, players are given a blueprint as a pity gift, but they have to source everything from screws to glass to put it together.</p>
<p>The farming and ranching itself is reminiscent of <em>Farming Simulator</em>. There’s a lot of deep planning and thought behind how and what you’ll plant. With the internet’s array of seeds to choose from and different types of plots and seeds, there’s plenty of depth. Bringing this level of depth to a cozy farming game isn’t unheard of, but it’s a nice touch that gives players an actual choice in what they want to plant.</p>
<h2>It’s all in the details</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playing-claw-machine-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=9kwMMKkf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playing-claw-machine-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=Doqez6hP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Minigames are a fun part of certain hangout interactions, like the claw machine.</figcaption></figure><p><em>SunnySide </em>absolutely nailed the details of the genre. There’s so much that players can delve into and explore in-depth, all while having total customization of things like their phone case, its background, and even the notification sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story blends into the gameplay naturally, and it doesn’t feel like any specific gameplay is forced. Instead, players have to tackle multiple different things to make it in <em>SunnySide</em>, which is the goal from the start anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything in&nbsp;<em>SunnySide </em>is cohesive and feels natural, and that’s because of the attention to small details in every aspect of the game. Whether you’re praying at the local shrine to upgrade your skill tree, making friends to further the story, or creating the most amazing strawberry farm in existence, everything comes together naturally and beautifully.</p>
<h2>The unfortunate reality of bugs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/picture-taking-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=1rtAaB5G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/picture-taking-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=VTU3f4Pb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking pictures of birds and bugs is actually part of <em>SunnySide</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, bugs are everywhere in the game. It’s easy to fall through the world when loading into areas or get stuck somewhere. This happened at least once every two hours of gameplay. However, <em>SunnySide </em>has several mechanics in place for resetting things. For example, players can respawn where they last slept at any given time. They can also summon their vehicle if it gets stuck no matter where they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These fail-safes are great, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that the issues are glaring and abundant. It also doesn’t account for visual bugs, like characters facing the wrong way in a conversation or suddenly appearing/disappearing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A great game with lots to get over</h2>
<p>Despite the major bug problems, <em>SunnySide </em>is a game that shines in its genre. There’s nothing quite like it, and the overwhelmingly well-done parts of it are worth getting around the bugs for (especially when it's so easy to get around them).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wonderful character development, seamless and natural storytelling and gameplay, and perfectly polished details are far better than the bugs would suggest. Future updates could make this game shine even brighter. However, even with the bugs, <em>SunnySide </em>is such a leap for the genre that it’s worth investing time into. It's a game I'll be returning to over and over again for some time.&nbsp;</p>

SunnySide may be full of bugs, but the amazing attention to detail in the gameplay loops make it a standout title in the genre. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-july-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/02/xbox-game-pass-july-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Xbox announced the first wave of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in July 2024, including Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2.</p>



<p>The following titles will join the Xbox Game Pass through mid-July 2024:</p>



<ul>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet – July 3</li>



<li>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 – July 3</li>



<li>Cricket 24 – July 9</li>



<li>The Case of the Golden Idol – July 9</li>



<li>Neon White – July 11</li>



<li>Tchia – July 11</li>



<li>Magical Delicacy – July 16</li>



<li>Flock – July 16</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pixel art platformer Magical Delicacy and creature collector Flock are both indie games that will be available day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>The biggest title in the first wave will arrive tomorrow, with Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. This confirms a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tchia-and-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak from last month</a>. The leaker successfully claimed the popular fighting game and Tchia were both coming to Game Pass. </p>



<p>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 still has solid Metacritic ratings from both critics and users, so it’s a valuable Game Pass addition. Xbox and Best Buy even teamed up to announce a themed, limited edition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-announces-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-special-edition-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X bundle</a> that included the game last March.</p>



<p>However, the majority of titles for the first half of July concentrate on smaller developers. This is similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-next-wave-of-june-2024-game-pass-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous wave in June</a>. Some of the highlights leaving Game Pass this month are The Wandering Village and Figment 2: Creed Valley, both indie darlings.</p>

                <p>There's no shortage of exotic weapons in modern Call of Duty games, but a new "Extra Crispy" gun uncovered by dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_" rel="nofollow ">RealityUK</a> is easily the most absurd one yet for the franchise. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Frealityuk_%2Fstatus%2F1807501354086060472%3F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-dutys-new-deep-fried-weapon-is-clucking-weird%2F1100-6524642%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The wonderfully silly trailer for the weapon</a> shows off an operator dressed to kill in a chicken costume, unleashing extra-crispy rounds on opponents and transforming them into pieces of fried chicken.</p><p>Things get even sillier <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FModernWarzone%2Fstatus%2F1807166495618720183&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-dutys-new-deep-fried-weapon-is-clucking-weird%2F1100-6524642%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">when the weapon is inspected</a>, as it involves shoving a raw chicken on the barrel and cooking it up for a quick meal. For now, the gun is exclusive to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-572199">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</a> and will be an optional cosmetic. Is it weird? Absolutely. Is it slightly disturbing to think that a pile of crispy chicken nuggets that used to be a human being could look so delicious? We're trying not to think too hard about it.</p><p>Like several other live-service games, cosmetics like this have helped Call of Duty stand out from the pack. With Fortnite building a gigantic metaverse of pop-culture crossovers, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-call-of-duty-warzone-licensed-skins-from-terminator-to-snoop-dogg/2900-4328/" data-ref-id="2900-4328">Call of Duty has followed in its footsteps</a> with several operator bundles, some of which have been focused on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Warhammer 40K, and Tomb Raider. The weapon skin bundles have even referenced games and anime, like Crash Bandicoot and Attack on Titan, so a gun that transforms enemies into the best lunchtime meal isn't too surprising.</p><p>If you prefer your weapons to be more grounded, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will reboot the cosmetics arsenal when it launches later this year, as bundles from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 won't carry over. That should keep things more serious at launch, at least for a little while.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">including a day-one Game Pass launch</a>.</p>

<p>The Palia developer will continue to operate independently under the leadership of its co-founders Anthony Leung and Aidan Karabiach.</p>
<p>Singularity 6 will use its expanded resources to invest in development, bring Palia to its 1.0 launch, and make the game available across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>"We ultimately want to get Palia into the hands of every gamer that wants to play it and we believe that we can best do so by partnering with Daybreak, who have a proven track record of building gaming communities that last for decades," said Leung.</p>
<p>"We look forward to benefiting from their experience, expertise, and investment into Singularity 6 and Palia."</p>
<p>Ham added: "Singularity 6 is an excellent addition to our development studios, renowned for their success in creating large-scale online games and content. Their debut title, Palia, is a fantastic addition to our online portfolio."</p>
<p>Daybreak is a subsidiary of Enad Global 7, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eg7-acquires-daybreak">which acquired the developer in 2020</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced the&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as some new details regarding what sort of gameplay improvements and tweaks we can expect.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced">originally revealed last week</a> via a teaser trailer that showed off some of its graphical boosts, but during yesterday's Capcom Next presentation, the studio revealed that the remaster will be launching across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 19th.</p>
<p>It's also now clearer exactly what&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>is; it's essentially occupying the middle ground between a remake and a remaster, sporting gameplay improvements like autosaving and other quality-of-life features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=oT-tqa3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=JsAYTNTl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Frank West returns in&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>this September.</figcaption></figure><p>Visually, you can look forward to refreshed character models and environments, as well as better facial expressions, material textures, and blood spatter effects.</p>
<p>If you felt like the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising&nbsp;</em>was too brutal, then you'll be pleased to know&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>makes a number of improvements in that direction as well, with the intent being to make the game a "smoother and friendlier" experience.</p>
<p>That means reworked controls, a better UI, and an autosave system so that you don't lose hours of progress. Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will be fully voiced, whereas the original occasionally defaulted to voice acting-free dialogue.</p>
<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>right here if you're interested in the project.</p>

<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will serve as a reworked version of the original 2006&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, which saw photojournalist Frank West descending into a shopping mall in order to uncover evidence of a zombie plague.</p>
<p>The game's innovative format, in which objectives and events would run along a timeline operating in real time, was retained for 2010 sequel&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising 2</em>. Will that be the next game in the series to get a remaster? We can but hope.</p>
<p>While we wait for news on that,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009074" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster/9n8bbg0zkfd5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 19th.</p>

            <p>
The latest round of rule changes coming to Dungeons &amp; Dragons were partly inspired by the experience of playing Baldur's Gate 3, the game's creator Wizards of the Coast has revealed.
</p>
<p>
If you're a D&amp;D player like me, you'll likely find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rXo-Wp_II">new 25-minute video</a> on changes made within the game's 2024 Player's Handbook an interesting watch, as the game's lead designer Jeremy Crawford sets out some impactful tweaks to the way many fan-favourite spells operate. 
</p>
<p>
D&amp;D updating its rules is nothing new, of course, but what was surprising to hear was that the experience of playing Baldur's Gate 3 directly prompted some of these rule changes - including to spells such as Cloud of Daggers and Produce Flame. 
</p>

<p>
For example, a major buff to Cloud of Daggers, the powerful area-of-effect spell which does exactly what it says on the tin, allows players to move it around the battlefield. This is a real boon, as invariably enemies would simply manoeuvre away from its AOE, making its cost only worthwhile for a short period.
</p>
<p>
Making the spell movable was something Crawford said he'd already considered, but that was reinforced by playing Larian's brilliant role-playing game spin-off. 
</p>
<p>
"Even when I cast Cloud of Daggers in Baldur's Gate 3, I want to be able to move it," Crawford said. 
</p>
<p>
"Some spells that were really painful to cast in terms of their action economy are far less painful," Crawford continued. "An example of that is Produce Flame, the Druid cantrip. 
</p>
<p>
"That cantrip was really painful to set up - once you got it going it could be fun to hurl the fire, [but] now it's way easy to cast it. And that is, funnily enough, another one where it was not only a pain to cast in the tabletop game but when I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 was excruciating... And it was while playing Baldur's Gate 3 I thought 'we are going to redesign Produce Flame so there will not be as much friction to cast this cantrip'."
</p>
<p>
Other big changes to the 2024 Player's Handbook include an adjustment for shapeshifting and related spells such as Polymorph. These now all give players temporary hitpoints based on the form they may be changing into, rather than a separate distinct set of hit points that are effectively treated as freebie. (Playing BG3 as a Druid, I did feel this was a bit broken.)
</p>
<p>
Last month, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian told fans that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">upcoming addition of mod support would mark a final handover moment to players</a>, as it prepares to move on to what's next. The studio has confirmed it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">not making Baldur's Gate 4</a>, and is instead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">working on something fresh instead</a>.
</p>
<p>
A Baldur's Gate 4 seems inevitable, however, regardless. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">Wizards of the Coast is "now talking to lots of partners" to determine who will make it</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-review-skirmish-done-right</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-review-skirmish-done-right.916923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-review-skirmish-done-right<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A flannel-clad Moose/man hybrid comes stampeding out of the facade of a ruined old building. Your huge insect wings flitter in annoyance as you fly up to perch on the outcropping of a rundown soda shop. You take aim with this ancient artifact known as a rifle, waiting for your chance to take the shot. This is the world of <i>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</i>, a new skirmish tabletop wargame by Free League Publishing. We got a chance to try the game out for ourselves, so read on to see if this rules-light skirmish game is right for you!</p>

<p><em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</em>&nbsp;is a new skirmish-sized tabletop miniature wargame for one to two players (and can be expanded to three or four players with the&nbsp;<em>Robots &amp; Psionics&nbsp;</em>expansion), produced by Free League Publishing. In it, players take on the role of a number of characters in the post-apocalyptic world of&nbsp;<em>Mutant Year Zero&nbsp;</em>(which is both <a href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/mutant-year-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a tabletop RPG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden-review-mutated-muppets">a video game</a>, which we previously reviewed).</p>
<p>Players will move their characters around a map with (included) 3D cardboard terrain, moving on movement templates and rolling dice to attack their opponents, all while attempting to secure ancient artifacts from a forgotten age.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-dux-is-ready.jpg?itok=BLbCnzfJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-dux-is-ready.jpg?itok=tiwjlcKh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dux (the aptly named duck man) is ready for anything!</figcaption></figure><p>Included in this core box is everything two players need to get started, with 10 high-quality miniatures (assembled and base-coat painted), cards for each character, custom dice, cardboard terrain, and more!</p>
<h2>Getting Into The Action Quickly</h2>
<p>One of the things that I most appreciate about&nbsp;<em>Zone Wars</em>&nbsp;is how easy and quick it is to get into the action with this box set. You'll choose an agreed upon amount of models per side to bring to the table (usually three to five), choose a scenario and follow along on the very simple setup instructions in the rules booklet, deploy your miniatures, and start chucking dice!</p>
<p>With no assembly required on these colored plastic minis, and what they call a "sun-drop coat of paint" (which is a phrase I've never heard before, but seems to mean "base coated and dry-brushed") on top, it takes zero time to get them to the table if you're not trying to do a full paint job.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-group-photo.jpg?itok=4PzAPBTd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-group-photo.jpg?itok=nRnBk9ru 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each character comes in a base color according to their faction.</figcaption></figure><p>And the rules could not be more straight-forward. You have an attack value, and you'll roll dice equal to that value&nbsp;<em>plus</em>&nbsp;the attack value of your weapon, and you hit on a 6. You can also always push your roll, but that comes with a risk of damaging your weapon.&nbsp; Though there are rules of cover, climbing, flying, special abilities (which you spend m-points on that you gain from rolling 1's), and more - it never feels overwhelming at all.</p>
<h2>But Is It Deep?</h2>
<p>This, to be honest, is where there's room for some valid criticism with the game. Because you're&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>trying to hit on 6's, each character can end up feeling somewhat similar (when it comes to attacking). There are other ways the characters feel special - like some are melee focused while some can fly, shout out a warning call, and more - but when it comes down to it, you're rolling a bunch of dice and hoping for 6's.</p>
<p>This is a strength for the game as it welcomes newcomers into the wargaming hobby, but more advanced skirmish gamers (like players of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-warcry-crypt-of-blood-review-skirmish-gaming-101"><em>Warcry</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frostgrave-fireheart-and-blood-legacy-preview-new-rules-for-frozen-north"><i>Frostgrave</i></a>, or even the new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead"><em>Warhammer </em><em>Spearhead</em></a>) may feel a little lacking for things to&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;or ways to make their units feel special.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-standoff.jpg?itok=_1yGyZPb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-standoff.jpg?itok=zLV9Whw2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A standoff for the ages!</figcaption></figure><h2>A Deluxe-Feeling, Approachable Package</h2>
<p>There's a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;packed into this box, considering its MSRP of $66 USD. The inclusion of two complete five-person teams of fighters is a great start, and hopefully you can see from the images throughout how fun, full of character, and detailed they all are. I also really, <i>really</i>&nbsp;like the cardboard terrain included in this box.</p>
<p>As a certified and proven <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/battle-systems-gothic-cityscape-review-hassle-free-terrain">lover of cardboard terrain</a>, the stuff included within this starter set is super engaging, sturdy, and even has some signage in Swedish, which creates this sort of version of the apocalypse that I find most compelling about the&nbsp;<em>Mutant Year Zero</em>&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>It's not the rust-colored, irradiated Route 66 stuff we're used to seeing in the U.S. - instead, everything feels bombed out, overgrown, and dangerous in its own unique way.</p>

<p>There's quite a lot to like in this box, and I have to say overall I'm pretty charmed by this new little skirmish game. What you lose in the ability to list build (which will likely expand as time goes on, if the game sells well) with pre-built forces you make up for in an out-of-the-box, ready to play game and system.</p>
<p>Because this is based on a well-fleshed out, well-loved Tabletop RPG, it comes across full of engaging personality, little bits of humor (artifacts you secure could include expired medicine, a leather jacket, a vacuum, etc.), and a very realized sense of style.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a game you can pull off the shelf and have ready to go in about 9 minutes,&nbsp;<em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</em>&nbsp;is the one for you. If, however, you need a bit more depth in your skirmish games (though, one would argue that's what full-sized miniature wargames are for!), then this may not have enough "meat on the bone."&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24190600/wicked-gladiator-2-release-dates-barbenheimer-wickiator</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-barbenheimer-a-date-change-tees-up-wickiator.916920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190600/wicked-gladiator-2-release-dates-barbenheimer-wickiator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="XihYdG">Universal Pictures has moved the release date of its lavish musical <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24070099/super-bowl-2024-wicked-trailer-ariana-grande-universal"><em>Wicked</em></a> forward by a few days, from Nov. 27 (the day before Thanksgiving) to the preceding Friday, Nov. 22.</p>
<p id="7TMwa4">The move is ostensibly, and sensibly, to avoid a clash with Disney’s animation sequel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166967/moana-2-trailer"><em>Moana 2</em></a>, also set for Nov. 27. Universal may have been motivated (read: scared) by the astonishing box office performance of Disney and Pixar’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review"><em>Inside Out 2</em></a>, which has racked up <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/inside-out-2-joins-billion-dollar-box-office-club-1235935762/">over $1 billion globally</a> in a little over two weeks, setting a new record for an animated film.</p>
<p id="zjBa8G">But the date change also sets up another, potentially more exciting clash: <em>Wicked</em>, which stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, will now hit theaters on the same day as Ridley Scott’s historical action drama <em>Gladiator II</em>, starring Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal. <em>Wicked </em>is the first part of a two-part adaptation of the hit stage musical, which prefigures the 1939 classic <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, telling the witches’ backstory. <em>Gladiator II</em> is a generation-later sequel to Scott’s Oscar-winning 2000 epic. (Vanity Fair just published a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-gladiator-ii-first-look">surprisingly meaty preview</a> of <em>Gladiator II</em>, which is stuffed with first-look images, plot details, and good quotes from Scott and the cast; it’s worth checking out.)</p>
<p id="PiKwxR">The contest between these two movies instantly recalls “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801761/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-double-feature-theme-connections">Barbenheimer</a>,” the 2023 box office phenomenon that pitted Greta Gerwig’s candy-colored comedy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23799502/barbie-movie-review-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling"><em>Barbie</em></a> against Christopher Nolan’s somber nuclear bomb drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23800273/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy"><em>Oppenheimer</em></a>. That date clash created a storm of publicity and a kind of unofficial festival of moviegoing that worked out to the benefit of both movies, which finished 2023 as the biggest and third-biggest films of the year worldwide.</p>
<p id="uEHVko">Theater owners, if no one else, will be hoping for similar from <em>Wicked </em>and <em>Gladiator II</em>, but the juxtaposition isn’t quite so striking this time around.<em> </em>It’s true that one is a colorful, fantastical stage musical centering female characters and the other is a violent action movie front-loaded with manly actors.</p>
<p id="Pcn13I">But they’re both big, old-school spectacles with Old Hollywood feel, and they don’t make for as stark (or as funny) a contrast as between a toy-branded meta comedy and a three-hour biopic about physics and nuclear holocaust. <em>Wicked</em> and <em>Gladiator II</em> are also both franchise movies of a sort, relying on brand familiarity, whereas <em>Barbie </em>and <em>Oppenheimer </em>are both daring, original films from auteur directors.</p>
<p id="OWeCtF">Also, it’s hard to come up with a compound name for them that rolls off the tongue as smoothly “Barbenheimer” does. Gladicked? Surely not. The best I can do is “Wickiator.”</p>
<p id="o7rAz1">None of that matters quite as much as what <em>Wicked</em> and <em>Gladiator II</em> have in common with <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em>, though: They’re both exciting-looking movies that present very compelling reasons to see them on the big screen, that complement each other in fun ways, and that stand to do very well with audiences. It’s going to be a fun November.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ajax_hq/status/1807853851862499380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent post</a> on X, Player 1st Games’ community manager @AJAX_HQ possibly teased that Scorpion from Mortal Kombat is coming to MultiVersus.</p>



<p>The post is a reply to fan-made concept art of Scorpion from Mortal Kombat as they might appear in MultiVersus. The post only includes an “eyes” emoji, but that does still suggest the fans should watch out for related news.</p>



<p>Since Warner Bros. owns NetherRealm, and Warner Bros. Games is the publisher behind MultiVersus, the collaboration does seem possible. If Scorpion does join the roster, it could open the door for other Mortal Kombat characters like Sub-Zero. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The community manager, @AJAX_HQ, has previously teased other concrete information. Just this week, they teased the anticipated Agent Smith <a href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1807895876658217363">via Twitter</a> with a “sunglasses” emoji. </p>



<p>MultiVersus unveiled a new Agent Smith “Sounds Like Inevitability” trailer with gameplay today ahead of the character’s launch. A new <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/New-MultiVersus-Trailer-Reveals-First-Gameplay-of-Upcoming-Playable-Ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> from Player 1st Games says that Agent Smith “will join the roster on July 8 as part of Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy.”</p>



<p>Although @AJAX_HQ may have teased Scorpion, Player 1st Games did not officially confirm anything about them joining the MultiVersus roster at this time.</p>



<p>In late May 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leaks-tease-possible-new-characters-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new leaks surfaced</a> hinting at some of the other characters and stages possibly coming to MultiVersus. Some of those included Daffy Duck, Samurai Jack, Candy Kingdom, and more.</p>
