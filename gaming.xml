          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Blue Prince Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The revelation came in the form of a journal entry, secreted away in a safety deposit box, hidden within the sometimes tough-to-access vault of the strange and shifting Mount Holly Manor. Reaching the paper requires solving one of Blue Prince's toughest, most obtuse, and most rewarding puzzles, one you won't even realize exists until you've broken through riddle after riddle and uncovered mystery after mystery. It recontextualizes everything that has come before it, not only the winding and involved test of wits that is the manor itself, but the story that had to be similarly excavated along the way--one of political intrigue and family tragedy, the rising and falling of kingdoms, the stoking of revolution, and the sacrifice necessary to breathe life into ideals.</p><p dir="ltr">The journal entry left by Herbert Sinclair, the shadowy great uncle responsible for the intricate puzzle box that is Mount Holly Manor, relates to how he discovered something after his brother's death. Lady Aurevei, the mother of Herbert and the younger Simon, was an avid fan of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Simon had discovered something of his mother's after <em>her</em> death--a page full of four-letter words, arranged in a grid, with seemingly no relationship to one another. It was a cipher; an encrypted message.</p><p dir="ltr">I can almost imagine what would have passed through Simon's mind when he found that note, because it's not unlike what's been going through my mind the entire time I've been playing Blue Prince, but more intense. It's that feeling of uncertainty and discovery, of wondering what awaits just beyond your grasp, and of seeking out the right tools, the right clues, to uncover it. Solving these puzzles is exhilarating; it's a rush of endorphins as inspiration strikes or a revelation hits, and that's just when you're solving them for the hell of it. The feeling born of uncovering something that belonged to a lost parent--of stumbling upon a secret locked way behind a code that might let you learn something new about someone you loved--that's hard to quantify, and harder to ignore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522641-blueprincejournal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522641" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522641-blueprincejournal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522641"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522641-blueprincejournal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The journal details how Simon worked on the cipher for years. He sought out books on cryptography and poured over research hoping to understand it, documenting the road he paved along the way. But he never did crack the code. Much in the way Simon discovered the cipher in his mother's effects after her death, it was in the aftermath of Simon's death that his brother Herbert uncovered the cipher and Simon's attempts to solve it.</p><p dir="ltr">And so Herbert took up the challenge. Like his mother, Herbert was a puzzle-master, a lover of riddles and brain-teasers. Despite being the wealthy baron of Mount Holly, Herbert spent his years devising puzzles for the local newspaper--Baron's Bafflers. While Herbert saw that his brother had been diligent and intelligent in his attempts to solve the cipher, he also recognized that Simon didn't really have a head for code-breaking. For Herbert, though, these things came more naturally, and he turned all his skills on the cipher. He would succeed where Simon failed. He would find what their mother left behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Thirty years passed.</p><p dir="ltr">Herbert's journal entry ends with him admitting that, despite everything, the cipher bested him, too. Over the decades, he'd had little choice but to come to terms with that. He never found out what the message was, or why she created it. Aurvei was gone. He couldn't ask her what she might have wanted the brothers to know. He had to quietly accept that a piece of his mother's life was there, in his hands--but it would remain inaccessible to him. Forever.</p><p dir="ltr">Reading Herbert's journal made it clear to me that a nagging feeling I kept getting about Blue Prince--that for every one of its many questions you might answer, success only ever seemed to lead you to two more--was an intentional decision by its creators. You're supposed to feel like the spiral spins ever downward. You're supposed to wonder what it's all for. You're supposed to feel the frustration that comes with the growing sense you might never find the bottom.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522645-blueprincehartleylies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522645-blueprincehartleylies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522645"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522645-blueprincehartleylies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For much of its runtime, Blue Prince feels like the unfurling of a plan as you follow in the footsteps of others. After a while, you start to discover the things that truly make Blue Prince fascinating as the game subtly points you toward them, offering more and more clues to direct your gaze. Some rooms hide greater mysteries that unlock other parts of the grounds. Some hold computer terminals with emails or special functions, accessible only once you've divined the network password. Some include locked safes whose combinations you have to ferret out, while others contain archives of news stories that give hints about family secrets and world history, or books full of cryptic clues. The more of these you draw together, the more a picture starts to slowly come into focus, and each new discovery builds on the growing and enthralling revelation that there is much, much more to Mount Holly Manor than is ever obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, as you uncover more of Sinclair's story and solve more of his many puzzles, you also start to learn the story of Mary, Sinclair's niece and the mother of Simon Jones, the game's protagonist. Mary has been missing for years at the start of Blue Prince, but by following the breadcrumbs scattered throughout Mount Holly Manor, you begin to understand that Mary left something behind for Simon to find--an even deeper and more compelling puzzle than any of the others.</p><p dir="ltr">Herbert Sinclair and Mary worked together to blaze this trail for you, and opening each lock, uncovering each clue, and reading each note is something you have to earn--something deliberately hidden from others so that only you would find it, with a new, tiny piece of the real puzzle as your reward. They had something they wanted you to accomplish, a destination they needed you to reach--and they left a blueprint to guide you to it. You're in conversation with these people from the past, these members of Simon's family. They speak to you even from beyond the grave, and what's more, you learn more and more about them with each new correspondence or clue. Sinclair and Mary may both be gone, but you find out a great deal about what kind of people they were and how they felt about their roles and responsibilities. You start to know them through both the parts of themselves they specifically left for you, and the clues scattered throughout that give a sense of their lives beyond them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522646-blueprincetypewriter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522646-blueprincetypewriter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522646"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522646-blueprincetypewriter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Eventually, you discover the Master Bedroom, where Sinclair slept. It's a hard room to come by, thanks to the randomness inherent to Mount Holly and the specific requirements to make it appear, which helps increase the likelihood that it'll probably be at least some hours into the game before you happen across it. Inside, you find another letter addressed to Simon, but this one doesn't wait in an envelope--it's still in the typewriter.</p><p dir="ltr">"Simon," it reads. "I never intended to finish this letter but by now you must know th"--and there's nothing more.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever Sinclair intended to write, whatever he wanted to impart to Simon with this final note, we'll never know. Sinclair is gone, and the letter will never--<em>can never--</em>be finished.</p><p dir="ltr">As you continue following the threads Sinclair and Mary left behind, that feeling returns again. Where is all this going? Again and again, you think you know the destination; again and again, you open a door expecting it to be waiting ahead of you--only to find more doors. Walking down Blue Prince's path, you are undoubtedly moving forward, but with each landmark you reach and each triumph you notch, there's only another on the horizon.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522647-blueprinceladyclara.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522647-blueprinceladyclara.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522647-blueprinceladyclara.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the bedroom of Mary's mother, the avid amateur astronomer Lady Clara, you find a scrap of paper with a spiral drawn on it and a note written beneath, which reads, "Does it never end?" The note refers to a constellation you can discover in Blue Prince's sky, the Spiral of Stars. Each time you gaze up at it, it is extended by one star and its description grows by one word, continuing on and on, seemingly endless. After a time, that question on the note seems to stop referring to the Spiral of Stars, and start referring to Blue Prince itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm now 200 hours into Blue Prince, and as far as I can tell, I have seen, experienced, and solved everything that <em>anyone </em>who has played or is playing has seen, experienced, or solved. The credits have rolled twice. I've seen cutscenes that imply endings, with some degree of emotional catharsis. But each time, the game has just started back up again, and each time, I've had a handful of leads that still need to be followed. Room 46? Unlocked it. Mary's hidden message to Simon? Read it. Aurvei's cypher? Solved it, and the incredible new questions to which it gives rise.</p><p dir="ltr">I've been as far as the path has been trod, and <em>yet more mysteries remain</em>. Blue Prince has presented me with what could be considered conclusions, but none of them is a 100% satisfying, definitive <em>completion</em>. Stories remain unfinished. Clues remain unsolved. Doors remain unopened. Right now, you can solve all we know how to solve in Blue Prince, and still have a game's worth of questions plaguing you.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's one: that spiral note I mentioned? It's one of several notes with spirals on them, each with a message that's an anagram for the others. Nobody in the Blue Prince community knows what to do with them or what they mean. They're just free-floating clues, signposts pointing toward a fog into which many of us have ventured, but of which <em>no one</em> has seen the other side.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522642-blueprincedoesitneverend.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522642-blueprincedoesitneverend.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522642"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522642-blueprincedoesitneverend.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In many players, that has left Blue Prince with the feeling that, even despite playing a brilliantly constructed game for potentially hundreds of hours, eventually it sort of just...fizzles out. You get to a point where you have clues, and you have ideas, but you can't seem to put them together in the right way to continue on. As you come to dead end after dead end, eventually, you just give up playing.</p><p dir="ltr">In "<a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending" rel="nofollow ">Does Blue Prince never end?</a>," Aftermath's Chris Person meditates on this feeling and the sense that there is, perhaps, no real complete conclusion to Blue Prince. His analysis is more about the means by which the game burrows into your skull, rewires your brain, and creates obsession--as well as how its murky depths may drive you mad if you stare into them too long, squinting to make out cloudy, drifting answers that might just be random shapes given meaning by your fevered imagination.</p><p dir="ltr">"Leaving that many loose strings is either uncharacteristically lax from an otherwise meticulously planned game, a series of red herrings to drive the player base insane, or a sign that the game has not been beaten," Person writes. "It’s also possible that this is the end of the rabbit hole. Maybe no ending could ever satisfy the kind of players that the game has created and that it has trapped itself into a corner of anticlimax. Maybe there is a metatext here about puzzles and clues, about some mysteries tormenting you and clawing at you for your entire life, just out of reach."</p><p dir="ltr">I've come to believe that there are more mysteries in Blue Prince than there are means to solve them. It's possible that Blue Prince is unique among puzzle video games, in that it will never be completely solved. I think that, maybe, it <em>can </em>never be completely solved.</p><p dir="ltr">Person's last thought of that quote, speculating about a metatext on puzzles and clues and the torment of mysteries, is the correct one, in my mind. Not that Blue Prince is caught in an inescapable anticlimax, the density of its phenomenal execution and incredible ambition creating a black hole that is impossible to escape despite its best efforts--but that this anticlimax is exactly the point the game is making.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522643-blueprincewhitesand.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522643" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522643-blueprincewhitesand.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522643"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522643-blueprincewhitesand.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My grandmother recently passed away at the age of 94. She had a huge family--five children, more than a dozen grandchildren, and many more great-grandchildren--so the funeral was a family reunion of sorts, an opportunity to spend time with people I hadn't seen in years that was somehow both somber and joyous.</p><p dir="ltr">Through the course of the several days I spent back home for the whole event, I learned things about my grandmother I had never known. She was born in 1930 in France but grew up in Italy, which I'd heard, but my aunts, uncles, and cousins told me more about that journey, as well as her life during World War II, something she hadn't liked to talk about much. There were stories of her life that I'd known, and many others that were new to me. Some elements put her into sharper focus in my mind, while others shone a light on aspects of her life that, to me, remain blurry.</p><p dir="ltr">I spent a lot of time with my grandmother when I was young and I think I knew her pretty well, in a way that only family can, but there are so many things I never thought to ask, that I never heard about, that she never told me, and that I'll never know. There is no correspondence I can find, no riddle I can solve, no discovery I can make about her life that will ever tell me everything I might want to know about her. She's gone, and those answers are gone with her, and that is something that I have no choice but to accept.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, I imagine, exactly what Simon and Herbert Sinclair felt as they struggled with their mother's encrypted message. As the knowledge grew in their minds that they'd never find the answer, so would their sense of loss.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522644-blueprinceherbertgrave.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522644" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522644-blueprinceherbertgrave.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522644"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4522644-blueprinceherbertgrave.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Blue Prince is acutely aware that real life abhors a satisfying conclusion, the idea of every string coming together into a tight, neat little bow, despite how much we've come to expect one from a constructed and curated experience such as a video game, and regardless of how much we humans might crave one.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not a story about reaching a climactic moment when all is finally revealed, when the effort is paid off, when the story is fully told, and when you know everything there is to know about Sinclair and Mary and Auravei. Blue Prince is about grieving people we've lost, and the realization that, try as hard as we might to understand them, to compile information about them and to gather all that remains, there comes a time when we are unable to truly know them any more than we already do. Every puzzle we solve will only lead to another until eventually, we reach a cipher we can't break.</p><p dir="ltr">At some point, you have to accept that the one person who could have told you the answer is the person you can never ask. The search for Mary teaches you about why she did what she did, but ultimately, you will never find her. The conversation with Sinclair allows him to impart his wisdom to Simon even from beyond the grave, but ultimately, it ends with an unfinished letter. We can continue to search, but the answers will always be elusive, and the spiral will spin on. The emotion Blue Prince is trying to create through this experience is not dissatisfaction--it's sorrow.</p><p dir="ltr">That is a powerful message to convey with any game, but with a puzzle game like Blue Prince, it's also an incredibly bold one. It stands apart from our expectations from the medium of games and our desires as humans. It demands more of us than simply finding an answer and reaching a conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps, one day, we'll know all there is to know in Blue Prince, see all its mysteries brought into the light, and watch as every one of its locked doors is thrown open. But I doubt it. Instead, I think Blue Prince's purpose is in its incompleteness. Its true ending is the dully painful, slightly sad one that happens not in the game, but in us. It's the one that makes us realize that we have no choice but to make our peace, and go on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2025 at a substantial discount. There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom, or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.</p><div><p id="FXxWVp"><h2>The best 4K TV deals for most people</h2></p></div><div><p id="268sW3"><h3>Samsung Q8F</h3></p></div><p><strong>Samsung’s Q8F</strong> is available for $697.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVPQZRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-55-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617399.p%3FskuId%3D6617399" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for the 55-inch model, which is its lowest price ever and an excellent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.</p><p>The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $200 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,797.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVQGMS9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-85-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617395.p%3FskuId%3D6617395" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->698</span></p><div><p>Samsung’s Q8F is an excellent all-around TV thanks to its 120Hz panel, wide color reproduction, and adaptive audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="tcl-qm7k"><h3>TCL QM7K</h3></p></div><p>If you want a 55-inch TV with a gorgeous and bright QD-Mini LED panel without spending over $1,000, the <strong>TCL’s QM7K</strong> is the set to get. It’s currently available for around $748 (originally $1199.99) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-65-Inch-QD-Mini-Premium-Mini-LED/dp/B0DVWXXRDL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and<a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-55-class-qm7k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2F6621468.p%3FskuId%3D6621468" rel="sponsored"> Best Buy</a>, which is its lowest price ever. It features a native 144Hz refresh rate with support for up to 288Hz speeds at 1080p when playing games with VRR. However, only two of its four HDMI ports support those speeds; the other two top out at 4K/60Hz or 1440p/120Hz. It also features a dynamic light algorithm to prevent images from appearing washed out.</p><p>The TV boasts up to 2,500 local dimming zones, according to TCL, but that depends on the size you get. The folks at <em><a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/qm7k#:~:text=TCL%2065QM7K-,966,-288">RTINGS</a></em> found out that the 65-inch version has 966 zones, though even with fewer of them in the 55-inch model, it should still provide good brightness control. Having more dimming zones means the TV can control the brightness of more precise sections of the screen, helping to avoid blooming, which is when an area around the source of light on the screen is too bright, breaking the realism of the image. The QM7K is powered by TCL’s AiPQ Pro processor, which uses AI to manage its contrast, color, clarity, motion, and upscaling. TCL partnered with Bang &amp; Olufsen to provide the TV’s audio system. You can get a 75-inch model for around $1,299.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-65-Inch-QD-Mini-Premium-Mini-LED/dp/B0DVX9RF7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-75-class-qm7k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2F6621474.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> if you need a bigger screen.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->748</span></p><div><p>TCL’s midrange QM7K has a QD-Mini LED TV with a 144Hz refresh rate, hundreds of local dimming zones for more precise brightness controls, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="panasonic-z85"><h3>Panasonic Z85</h3></p></div><p>We have a dedicated section for high-end OLED TV deals below, but <strong>Panasonic’s Z85</strong> is such a good value that it deserves consideration for folks who may be on a budget.

The Z85’s OLED panel is its standout feature, as it achieves perfect black levels and vivid color. It has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, and two of its four HDMI ports support that speed at 4K. The Z85 also supports both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, which minimize screen tearing and other visual artifacts when playing on a PC with a compatible video card.</p><p>The 4K TV features an HCX Pro AI Processor MKII to control its color, contrast, and clarity, optimizing the image and sound quality of whatever you’re watching in real-time. The TV’s audio system features a built-in subwoofer for enhanced bass. The Z85 runs FireOS, Amazon’s entertainment-focused OS, so you have the option to use many functions by asking Alexa via its voice-enabled remote. A 55-inch model of the Z85 is also available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Newest-55-inch-Adaptive-Refresh/dp/B0D97GB5HM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for $897.99.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->898</span></p><div><p>Panasonic’s Z85 is an incredibly good value for an OLED TV at its size.

The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs FireOS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can step up to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-43-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBLZYY5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">50-inch model</a> for $259.99 ($140 off), or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-43-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBS9GKV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">55-inch model</a> for $339 ($120 off), if you like its modest feature set but want a larger screen.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->220</span></p><div><p>Amazon’s 4-Series TV boasts solid specs, including HDR10 support, making it an extremely affordable option regardless of the chosen size.</p></div></div><div><p id="hisense-qd7"><h3>Hisense QD7</h3></p></div><p>If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch <strong>Hisense QD7</strong> has a lot to offer for its current sale price of $399.99 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Class-Mini-LED-Smart-55QD7QF/dp/B0DYVXN9HT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-55-class-qd7-series-mini-led-qled-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-fire-tv-2025%2F6621483.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (<a href="https://youtu.be/tjUZmaMRwtQ">this video</a> from LG shows how it works, but lower your volume first), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for $499 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Class-Mini-LED-Smart-55QD7QF/dp/B0DYVXN9HT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->400</span></p><div><p>The QD7 has a QLED panel that can display over a billion colors and supports multiple HDR formats.

The 55-inch model received its first price drop to around $2,296.99 ($203 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1885601-REG%2Flg_oled55g5wua_oled_evo_ai_g5.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Upscaling-Filmmaker-Orchestra-OLED65G5WUA/dp/B0DYQGRHX3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. LG claims that the 4K TV’s OLED panel offers a 33 percent jump in brightness over its predecessor. It has a 120Hz refresh rate, with support for Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, plus a near-instantaneous 0.1ms response time, and fast gaming at 165Hz with VRR available on all four of its HDMI ports. The G5 can also play games via the cloud with the Xbox app.</p><p>The TV’s Alpha 11 4K AI Processor enables AI Picture Pro to manage the brightness, depth, and clarity of every frame, and it will automatically upscale non-4K video. The G5’s audio system features five up-firing speakers, providing more sophisticated surround sound than most TVs can provide. LG’s G5 is a luxe TV with great specs that will likely remain on the cutting edge of screen tech for the next few years. LG offers a 65-inch model that’s on sale for around $3,196.99 ($203 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1885603-REG%2Flg_oled65g5wua_oled_evo_ai_g5.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-g5-series-oled-evo-ai-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-with-one-wall-design-2025%2F6621810.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2297</span></p><div><p>The LG G5 is a top-of-the-line OLED TV with perfect contrast, a powerful AI processor, a 120Hz refresh rate, 4,000 nits maximum brightness, support for Nvidia G-Force, AMD FreeSync Premium, and a .1ms response time.</p></div></div><div><p id="sony-a90k"><h3>LG C4 OLED</h3></p></div><p>The<strong> LG C4</strong> is the company’s 2024 best all-around OLED TV, and the 65-inch model currently on sale for around $1,296.99 ($304 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1812659-REG%2Flg_oled65c4pua_evo_c4_65_4k.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024%2F6578042.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Like the G5, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and G5 is its maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, though that will vary depending on the content you’re watching. It has a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. The LG C4 shares many of the same core features as the G5, but at nearly $1,000 less.

The 4K set has an a8 AI Processor 4K that’ll upscale non-4K video and optimize video and audio quality better than its predecessor, though not as well as the chips in LG’s higher-end TV models. The B4 also has LG’s Gallery Mode for displaying photos or paintings when you’re not actively using it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As the esports industry searches for new sources of revenue, Riot Games has <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">opened up its <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> esports leagues to sports betting sponsorships</a>. The decision will permit tier one organizations – or the highest level of professional players – in the North and South America and European esports leagues of <em>Valorant</em> and <em>LoL</em> to secure paid sponsorships from sports betting companies, a previously prohibited category of sponsor.</p><p>According to Riot, the reason for this change is because it’s what the players and esports organizations have been asking for. “We agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams,” wrote John Needham, president of publishing and esports at Riot Games.</p><p>There was a time in esports history when sponsorship dollars flowed in, generating lots of revenue for game publishers and enabling organizations to pay players salaries in the millions of dollars. Esports was seen as an investment vehicle, with media corporations and even traditional sports companies investing their dollars in hopes of capitalizing on what was then an untapped but steadily growing market. One of the most famous examples, Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League, <a href="https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/19347153/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms">sold franchise slots for tens of millions of dollars</a> to investors like New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Comcast.</p><p>But the comparatively small revenue these leagues generate in conjunction with the high costs to run them, combined with the general economic downturn of the covid-19 pandemic, meant that companies could not get a return on their investments and began pulling their money out. It’s forced esports organizations and esports game publishers alike to find new ways to pay players and staff or risk shuttering entirely, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23954005/overwatch-league-shuts-down-activision-blizzard">as the Overwatch League has</a>. </p><p>Over the last few years, Riot has changed how its esports leagues have worked to better weather what’s being called the “esports winter” or general contraction of the esports industry. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970110/the-lcs-is-shrinking"><em>LoL</em> league ecosystem has gotten smaller</a>, thereby eliminating some teams’ financial burden of participating (it costs $10 million dollars to have a slot) while also reducing Riot’s financial responsibilities via its revenue sharing agreement with partnered teams. The addition of new categories of sponsors is the company’s latest attempt to bring sustainability to its corner of the struggling esports scene.</p><div><p>And sports betting companies are well-poised to fill that funding gap. While gambling sites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453321/overwatch-league-grand-finals-2022-dallas-fuel">aren’t the only game in town if your esport needs money</a>, they are some of the best paying. (Even <em>The Verge </em>is not immune with Vox Media displaying ads for gambling companies on its sites and podcasts.) Stake is an infamously known quantity in the video game streaming ecosystem, throwing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764530/twitch-star-felix-xqc-lengyel-has-signed-a-100-million-deal-with-rival-platform-kick">eye-watering sums of cash at the most popular streamers</a> to either make content on their own platform (Stake owns livestreaming site and Twitch competitor Kick) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938853/kick-nickmercs-gambling-contract-stake">or to gamble on stream to their millions of viewers</a>. </p></div><p>Until now, Riot has prohibited its esports partner organizations from taking sponsorships from gambling companies. But the publisher says its guidelines can help implement the new type of sponsorship in a “responsible” way with guidelines for teams and Riot to follow. These guidelines include Riot vetting all potential betting sponsors, teams adhering to an integrity program, and the prohibition of gambling ads on team jerseys or official Riot broadcasts.</p><p>The formal inclusion of sports betting comes with significant risk to both competitive and moral integrity. Kids and young adults watch these streams, as well as the media around them. While Riot is not letting gambling companies put their logos on jerseys or the official broadcasts, the media around its esport is likely to become even more inundated with offers for gambling. This is what we’ve already seen with programming and podcasts focused on traditional sports like the NBA and NFL in the years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24312149/sports-gymnastics-tennis-surveillance-ai#:~:text=But%20in%202018%2C%20the%20law%20was%20overturned%2C%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20ruling%20that%20it%20was%20a%20violation%20of%20the%2010th%20Amendment">since the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was overturned in 2018</a>. </p><div><p>There have also already been allegations of and investigations into match fixing in both <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/underdog-league-of-legends-esports-scene-rocked-by-massive-match-fixing-allegations-impacting-two-thirds-of-players-the-stench-of-this-will-never-leave/"><em>League of Legends</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/article/1926386268209873010"><em>Valorant</em></a> esports, with Riot recently <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/news/esports/competitive-ruling-lco/">banning two players from Riot competitions for three years</a>. The addition of sports betting sponsorship – which could become a significant if not main source of revenue for many teams – has the potential to exacerbate existing competitive integrity issues as well as <a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1852450790146773489">open up a potential avenue of harassment for players</a>.</p></div><p>With esports revenues still comparatively low, the industry has been getting increasingly desperate for any new sources of funding. Riot <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/league-of-legends-valorant-esports-world-cup">has already faced criticism</a> for participating in events funded by Saudi Arabia as a part of the country’s longstanding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment">sportswashing strategy</a>. Riot’s inclusion of sports betting for <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> will likely be no less controversial.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694360/league-of-legends-valorant-sports-betting-sponsorships]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Long-time readers will know I am a massive Bubble Bobble fan, and may also know that recent games based on the classic Taito arcade game<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/20/bubble-bobble-4-friends-the-baron-is-back-review/"> have been lacking</a>. That brings us to Bubble Bobble: Sugar Daddi.. er, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons!</p>
<p><iframe title="Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons | Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsuoLXelpv8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the negatives, boo, this seems to be single player only. Apart from that it does seem to be very faithful to Bubble Bobble but with some new twists that make it appealing.</p>
<p>You can still run about as Bub, fire bubbles to trap enemies, and burst them to kill them off. You can still bounce on bubbles, launch fire and water bubbles, and the boss battles look like they are from Rainbow Islands, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Rather than one set of levels that must be passed sequentially, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is going a bit indie and will feature randomised levels so every play is different. You will not have to wipe out every enemy to progress either, just make it to the Donut Gate to exit. There’s also a new power up system in which you can use ingredients collected in your run to buy special powers to help you along.</p>

<p>That is pretty much it, and again that’s a good thing, Bubble Bobble was nigh on perfect so adding anything too different to the mix always spoiled the classic gameplay.</p>
<p>Arc System Works will be handling the publishing on PS5 and Switch (that’s Switch, and not Switch 2) in the West and most of Asia, and they will also be publishing worldwide on PC via Steam, and all of these will be out this Winter. Japanese players will have the game published by the OG creators, Taito, and that versions will be out in 2026.</p>
<p>I am cautiously optimistic, roll on Winter.</p>

Note that if an area hasn’t been connected to the network yet and is offline, Sam will not be able to deploy a PCC.</p><figure id="" data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once an area is online, you’ll be able to see structures that other players have left behind. This form of asynchronous multiplayer plays into <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s themes of building connections and helping others out.</p><p>When you ping your immediate surroundings using Sam’s Odradek, you’ll receive a signal that’ll highlight any nearby structures as blue. These can be your own equipment, as well as others left behind by players. You’ll often see ladders used as makeshift bridges or ropes placed nearby steep hills that you can take advantage of.</p><figure id="" data-id="c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-recommend-id="image://c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-recommend-id="image://c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also pieces of cargo that other players may have disregarded for whatever reason, and you can go ahead and deliver them to the appropriate terminal if you desire. You can also come across abandoned vehicles that can come in handy, especially if you’re in the middle of a delivery, lightening your load.</p><p>Other structures, like Timefall Shelters and Generators can come in clutch during your deliveries as well. As someone who relies heavily on vehicles when delivering cargo, coming across another person’s Generator always feels like a godsend, letting me recharge my vehicle’s battery to make the final mile to my destination without requiring me to pull out my own PCC to build a power source myself.</p><p>However, <strong>the best part of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s online elements is that you’re able to complete unfinished structures that other players have left behind</strong>. All you have to do is contribute the proper materials. There have been times where I’ve seen giant bridges near rivers that were left incomplete, seemingly waiting for someone else to take over the reins and finish them. Other players have also elected to create their own roads, which you can utilize.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your own structures will show up in other peoples’ games too, so be sure to pay it forward and build as many useful ones as you can.</p><hr><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is now available on PS5.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-chiral-network-multiplayer-connect-1851785246]]></content:encoded>

One, apparently, lets you circumvent the downsides of dealing with a demonic merchant, for the low, low price of many, many runes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've advanced far enough into Elden Ring Nightreign, you're probably familiar with Libra, the demonic Nightlord who loves to offer a bargain. These offers come with downsides, that players have found are sometimes worth tanking and sometimes not. Libra is an end-of-run Nightlord, but can also appear through a random world event in other expeditions against other Nightlords.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like other events, a purple fog will envelope the area and you'll get a notification, telling you a demon has cursed you. A chunk of your maximum health will also be blocked off, in the upper-left corner. Normally, to clear this, you'll need to head to the spot where the merchant has spawned and pay him, either 15,000 or 35,000 runes depending on the day, to lift the curse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the curse is lifted, you also get a buff. But as one reddit user has pointed out, paying off the Libra event lets you get a free buff if you interact with him again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For 15k/35k runes, you can get any of the available merchant buffs by talking to Libra again without any of the downsides," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/psa_paying_off_the_libra_raid_lets_you_buy_a_free/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they wrote</a>. "Eventual greatness activates instantly, the flask doesn't remove levels when you drink it. Feel free to kill the demon on day 2 if you're prepared enough, but ONLY AFTER you pay off the curse and get the free buff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, these buffs offer a trade-off. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0g9dW41wP8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garden of Eyes</a> catalogued all the possible buffs and side-effects, which range from extra flasks to stat boosts, at the price of some immediate cost to your person. Maybe a little less maximum health, or a timed stat debuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this particular event, though, it looks like you can get the possible pay-off without the recursive consequences, making the Faustian bargain just a bargain.

"We were just doing new everything. It was just a throwaway. When we were doing the initial foundation on Hitman 2016, we built it in a way where we would do smart reuse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Without being too precise, Hitman 2016… let's say it was a $100 million game. Hitman 2 was maybe $60 million. Hitman 3 was $20 million. And Hitman 3 was the highest Metacritic. It was 85, 84, and 87 Metacritic," he added. "And it had very unique new locations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intimating that the studio learned the hard way that Hitman Absolution was a "wasteful production," Abrak now says it "completely changed [the IO team's] thinking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Building this foundation, the brick system as we call it, where we can make an experience, like [new Hitman mission featuring Mads Mikkelsen] very quickly and efficiently," he added. "This was a really [important] part of us creating sustainable AAA production. I'm not going to sit here and say we are doing everything right. We'll keep on trying to improve and be less wasteful, but still super ambitious."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there is, by Abrak's own admission, "a bigger investment into Bond," the director is confident that "longevity" will be built into production. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we were to look at sequel at one point, who knows?

That's extremely important to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond." I'll certainly be counting the number of toilets we see…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive's James Bond game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007"><u>first announced back in 2020</u></a> as Project 007. From the off, IO said that it was developing a fresh James Bond origin story and a wholly original piece of work, rather than anything that followed the events of any particular film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until June 2025's PlayStation State of Play broadcast that we got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">first proper look at 007 First Light</a>. Set to launch in 2026, 007 First Light's incarnation of James Bond was involved in a childhood tragedy that left him an orphan at the age of 11, after which he spent the rest of his childhood in various British boarding schools. We later see Bond as a young recruit in the Royal Navy, from which he is recruited by MI6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has said he hoped 007 First Light would be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy"><u>start of a new trilogy of games</u></a>, though, unfortunately, the studio's beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game"><u>Hitman franchise is on hiatus</u></a> while IO works on this game.

            <p>
Cast your mind back a year or so ago, and you might remember <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> being in a bit of a funny old place. On the one hand, it was a huge critical and commercial success; on the other, it was being review bombed into oblivion thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-official-review-bomb-cape-seemingly-gets-an-airing-as-psn-drama-subsides">Sony's mandatory PSN nonsense</a>. Eventually, all that hoo-ha died down, but not before developer Arrowhead suggested it might commemorate the whole affair with a review-bomb-inspired cape. Well, praise Democracy, because that day - and that cape - is finally here.
</p>
<p>
Talk of a review-bomb-inspired Helldivers 2 cape first surfaced as fans were celebrating Sony's U-turn on the mandatory PSN requirements it had attempted to foist on PC players post-launch - a reversal that came after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">200,000 negative Steam reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">mass refunds</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">absolute mess</a> of a situation in territories where PSN was unavailable. Amid the cheers and back pats, former Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt (now the studio's chief creative officer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605">shared a community created cape design</a> on social media, featuring four red vertical lines mirroring those of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Helldivers 2's Steam review sentiment graph</a> during its review bombing.
</p>
<p>
Almost immediately, delighted fans called for its official inclusion in the game, and Pilestedt responded by saying, "The team is talking about a good name for it right now." At the time, it wasn't entirely clear if he was being serious, but last May he <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">teased an official cape design</a> - or at least a tiny cropped portion of one - that suggested the review bomb cape was legit. And now, a little over a year later, it's officially arrived as a commemorative keepsake.
</p>
<p>
Dubbed the Pillars of Freedom cape, it's being released "in honour of [players'] unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy," according to an <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728">official post on social media</a>. "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armouries as soon as the rollout is complete," Arrowhead adds. "This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of ups and downs for Helldivers 2, with last August bringing a particularly difficult bump in the road for Arrowhead following significant community criticism regarding the live-service shooter's direction. The studio quickly moved to address the situation, though, embarking on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-reveals-60-day-plan-of-action-following-recent-patch-outcry">60-day plan of action</a>, which helped get things back on track. And that unity has proven vital in the ongoing fight for Democracy, considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have recently faced perhaps their biggest threat yet as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">Illuminate invaded Super Earth itself</a>.

			<p>Free-to-play first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/">Delta Force</a> from developer Team Jade will arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles on <strong>August 19, 2025</strong>, the studio announced.</p>
<p>The news comes alongside the reveal of what Team Jade is calling the game's "<em>largest update yet,</em>" which will be available for players on PC and mobile platforms in a little less than two weeks' time, on&nbsp;<strong>July 9, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the new content coming on July 9, the Season Break update will bring new maps for Operations and Warfare, a new operator, swimming, improvements to Victory Unite, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="SEASON BREAK PREVIEW STREAM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlXOM1OyUHc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Operations map is called Tide Prison, a high-tech island prison that players have to infiltrate under the guise of being a new batch of prisoners, meaning you'll have to collect your gear after you're already inside. The new Warfare map is called Cyclone, a tropical island that's hiding an ICBM missile site.</p>
<p>Cyclone will feature infantry and vehicle combat, and adds a dynamic weather system to the gameplay to create even more intense chaos.</p>
<p>The new operator players can select is Tempest, who players can unlock for free along with the battle pass. Tempest is a movement-focused operator with an exoskeletal device that gives them greater mobility and is ideal for close-ranged encounters where she can easily close the gap between her and her unsuspecting foes.</p>
<p>Players looking to dive into Delta Force on consoles will be able to take advantage of all the content in the game up to its release this August, and will be able to play the Black Hawk Down single-player campaign as part of free DLC. If you're incredibly keen to play Delta Force on your PS5 or Xbox Series device, than you can wishlist the game starting tomorrow, June 28, so you'll be sent a reminder by your platform of choice that it's ready for you to hop into.</p>

This includes staples like Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, and Amy. Fittingly, almost all characters have Haste. The drop even contains a 7-cost Enchantment called <em>Super State</em>. Given you usually need seven Chaos Emeralds to achieve a super form, the designers knew what they were doing.</p>

Much like the characters, these bits of gear are ubiquitous and almost as recognizable as the characters. Shadow's air shoes, Amy's Piko Piko Hammer, Eggman's Egg Pawn robots, or the Tornado Biplane. The cards featured in this set are as follows:</p>

The loot-based boss rush adventure never ran particularly great there but managed to break franchise records on Steam despite the terrible user reviews.

Capcom writes that it has “adjusted the amount of VRAM used with texture streaming, resulting in reduced overall VRAM usage.” That could help with resolution, framerate, and the amount of pop-in players encounter on PC while exploring the map. Other notable changes include new support for  DLSS4 and FSR4 for graphics upscaling, including multi-frame generation for new Nvidia cards. I’m not confident this is nearly sufficient to address what players are complaining about on PC, so we’ll have to wait and see just how much this improves game performance for the average <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fan. </p><p>While Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992">promised to address the poor state</a></span> of the PC version, major improvements have been slow to arrive. The game has been flooded with negative Steam reviews over the last month, with many players arguing that performance has actually gotten worse with each new update. “As of 5/28/2025, after 250+ hours of gameplay, the game will no longer boot up,” wrote one player on Steam. “<em>Monster Hunter Wilds?</em> Total disaster, folks. Frame rate drops harder than Biden on Air Force One,” wrote another. “Gameplay is fantastic, but the system requirements are a total lie fallacy, as is the benchmark,” wrote a third. “It’s not so bad at first until you get farther in, where weather effects really start taking effect and the framerate just tanks.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As players beat the drums of <em>Monster Hunter</em> discontent throughout June</a></span>, another major issue has been a sense that <em>Wilds</em>’<em>&nbsp;</em>endgame is too shallow, and there’s been renewed criticism arguing that playing it can feel like being on autopilot. Director Yuya Tokuda promised this week that Seregios will be the game’s most unpredictable boss fight yet, suggesting a fresh challenge for fans who feel like they’ve been sleepwalking the last few months. As teased by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese<em> Wilds </em>social media account</a></span>, September’s Title 3 update will include a new difficulty tier for quests, additional rewards, and RNG talismans, one of the core building blocks of every hunter build. </p><p>It’s good news that’s left some players scratching their heads. “So the actual endgame is going to come out 6 months after release date, huh?” one wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the<em> Monster Hunter</em> subreddit</a></span>. <em>Wilds</em> is currently averaging 17,000 concurrent players on Steam, scarcely 1 percent of its debut back in late February. Perhaps even more notably, it’s less than what <em>Monster Hunter: World </em>averages, and that came out back in 2018. That entry’s first big expansion didn’t arrive until 18 months after its release. Some fans are worried it could take <em>Wilds</em> that long to become the game they hoped it would be. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If entertainment writing hadn’t panned out, I like to think I’d have pursued a career in music. My only real experience, however, was a brief (and admittedly shaky) run as the second-chair violinist in my grade school orchestra—an honor that was mine by virtue of my more talented musical predecessor transferring schools. My musical acumen was only thanks to my color-coordinating sheet music so I knew where to put my fingers.</p><p>Music has always fascinated me, making it my fourth favorite passion after gaming, anime, and wrestling. I particularly enjoy unexpected collaborations like Imagine Dragons getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Duje_sZko8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carried by Japanese songstress Ado on their “Take Me To The Beach” remix</a>, Prince’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRCooFKk3c&amp;pp=ygUvcHJpbmNlIGd1aXRhciBzb2xvIHdoaWxlIG15IGd1aXRhciBnZW50bHkgd2VlcHM%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showstopping guitar solo cover of the Beatles’ “While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>,” and spontaneous live duets where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAOLJVsk9mA&amp;pp=ygUkbGlua2luIHBhcmsgY3Jhd2xpbmcgaW4gbXkgc2tpbiBkdWV0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell sang “Crawling In My Skin</a>,” breathing new life into an already timeless bop. Recently, I’ve become obsessed with a YouTube channel that motivates viewers to discover their inner musician by featuring rock legends who lead by example with improvisational flair.&nbsp;</p><p>While doom-scrolling my For You Page on TikTok, I stumbled upon highlight reels for a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrumeoOfficial/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drumeo</a>. Drumeo is an online drumming school aimed at turning curious beginners into confident musicians who wouldn’t blink if asked to tackle late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins’ deceptively tricky “Everlong” part. What captivated me about Drumeo wasn’t its drumming lessons, but segments where legendary performers listen to popular songs for the first time with the drums removed and improvise how they would accompany them. These segments are essentially musical fan fiction, testing each artist’s musical instinct and giving me, a music sicko, new covers to obsess over. In that spirit, I’m going to share three of my favorite of these segments in sequential order of how hard they fuck musically.&nbsp;</p><h2>John Stamos playing Papa Roach’s “Last Resort”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="John Stamos Hears Papa Roach For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZhJo3ieZJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Somehow, in all of Stamos’ 61 years of jamming out, including with The Beach Boys, he’s never listened to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort.” Watching him stop and start, inching his way into the chaos of the track, is strangely exhilarating. He feels out which of the many drums I won’t even pretend to know would best carry the weight of the beat, building the skeleton that’ll support the raucous emo rock anthem. After a thorough listen and a few curious jabs at the rhythm, his back-and-forth with the song turns almost jazz-like in its spontaneity and interpretive interjections. The groove he arrives at, after confirming it’s a heavy metal track, winds up breathing an even more briskly paced drum line that gives the song a whole new dimension that’s fascinating to listen to.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Police’s Stewart Copeland playing Limp Bizkit’s “Rollin’”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stewart Copeland Hears Limp Bizkit For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrbLyEKC524?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My second favorite in Drumeo’s For The First Time series is Stewart Copeland, who humbly and confidently tries to play Limp Bizkit’s “Rollin’.” After swigging his drumstick in his coffee (we listen and we don’t judge) and jokingly saying, “I don’t know shit about any songs,” Copeland absolutely nails the metal track, plunging headfirst into his version of its drumline. His take, surprisingly, sounds like a live performance of the song, enhanced with some flourishes and embellishments, showing Copeland's flair for adding a playful energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before watching this video, I’ll admit that I had never heard of Copeland. To me, The Police were just a homogeneous, monolithic musical entity without any distinguishable humans making up its parts. But after watching this, I’m obsessed with Uncle Stew Daddy’s energy and candor. I was especially tickled by him saying, “I like those guys [Limp Bizkit] in concept. I’m not that familiar with their music.” Like that’s the most polite and funny way to say “bless your heart” about a band while giving them kudos. And yes, I’ll be adding that phrase into my lexicon. Thank you very much, Mr. Copeland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith playing Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Chad Smith Hears Bring Me The Horizon For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Htmcj6HBN7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My absolute favorite video in this series is Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer Chad Smith being given the herculean task of improvising a drum line to Bring Me The Horizon’s banger “Can You Feel My Heart.” Words almost fail me to describe what it's like watching him, deep in his musical flow state like a man possessed, immediately delivering the most fitting drum accompaniment for the song. This performance straight up blows the original song out of the water. Smith’s version of “Can You Feel My Heart” damn near made me want to jump off of my couch and rip my shirt clean from its lapel with how masterfully he handles shaping its beat. What’s more, he even dared to suggest that his approach might not have been the right one for the song at all. Be so serious.</p><p>While all of the above might not be enough to convince me to enroll in Drumeo’s online academy (I’m more of a bass guy; problematic, I know), I understand why it serves as the channel’s leading example of what they offer to prospective musicians. I’m just happy to find covers I didn’t know I needed and learn more about the personalities behind some of the bands in my music rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba [Update]</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Riot Games has announced that it will begin officially sanctioning sports-betting sponsorships for esports teams in its Tier 1 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> leagues. While the company states that it still won't allow advertisements in its official broadcasts, teams themselves will be able to take money from sports-betting companies for advertising through their own channels.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, President of Publishing and Esports John Needham writes that the move is designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing sports-betting industry and to make esports-related betting more regulated. Seemingly to address concerns and head off potential criticism, Needham explains that the company is authorizing sports-betting sponsorships under a "guardrails first" strategy.</p><p>These "guardrails," Needham states, are essentially the rules by which any sponsorship must be executed. First, sports-betting companies need to be vetted and approved by Riot itself, although the company has not shared the criteria on which this vetting is done. Second, to ensure that sports-betting companies are on a level playing field, Riot is mandating that official partners all use GRID, the officially sanctioned data platform for League of Legends and Valorant. Third, esports teams must launch and maintain internal integrity programs to protect against violations of league rules due to the influence of sports betting. Fourth and last, Riot will use some of the revenue from these sponsorships to support its Tier 2 (lower division) esports leagues.</p><p>One of the biggest sources of anxiety and frustration around the explosion of sports betting in the United States has been the increasingly high frequency of sports-betting advertising, and Riot addresses this concern by promising to not have ads from these companies in "Riot-owned broadcast and social channels." This also means that teams will not be allowed to have sports-betting ads on team member jerseys. The only place these ads will be able to run are on team-owned channels. As Needham explains, "It will be up to each team to craft how sports-betting-related content shows up on their channels within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS [terms of service], and local regulations."</p><p>The company's justification for authorizing sports-betting sponsorships appears to center on a desire to address underground, unofficial, or otherwise unauthorized betting networks and organizations. "Sports betting--and more specifically, esports betting--is a space that more fans choose to engage with every year," Needham writes. "According to Sportradar, the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024. But here's the problem: 70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed."</p><p>As such, the company hopes that it can bring more of this activity under the auspices of the company, where it hopes to exert some regulatory influence (and, one would suspect, be able to collect more of the revenue that flows through sports-betting apps).</p><p>Despite the blog post's efforts to emphasize protecting esports integrity, though, Needham and Riot have not addressed any of the social issues that have been caused by the growth of sports betting throughout the country. An NCAA-sponsored study, for example, found that increasing harassment of college athletes in the United States can be <a href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ncaa/wagering/NCAAThreatMatrixPilotStudyPublicReport.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">primarily attributed to anger and disappointment related to sports betting</a>. This dynamic may be even worse along gendered lines; some evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a64772215/womens-sports-harassment-stalking-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">betting-related harassment disproportionately targets women</a>. Riot has yet to state if it will take any particular precautions to mitigate potential harms caused by sports betting; most of its emphasis so far appears to be assuaging fears about match fixing or other threats to esports integrity.</p>

<figure><a title="Toby Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf858058e69ad/toby-fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>June 5th marked the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, but that very same day (or the day before on other consoles), the highly anticipated continuation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, in Chapters 3 and 4, also hit digital shelves.</p>
<p>If you've had the chance to catch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">our review</a>, you'll know we fully believe this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> "follow-up" is worth the new price of entry too, even if there are three more chapters to go. With big games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> ready and available for play, I've instead chose to sink more time into the indie darling that is Deltarune. It's silly yet simultaneously serious world and characters have their hooks in me and it's all I find myself thinking about night after night.</p><div><figure data-videoid="htp-VfCtJow" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c7531trnzhg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htp-VfCtJow" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To help me try and silence those voices and get a few extra hours of sleep, I was graciously given the chance to pepper Deltarune's creator, Toby Fox, with a few of the questions that have been knockin' about in my noggin. Did Toby answer my questions? Yes. Did he also take every opportunity to run in a different direction and troll me? Yes, and yes, but that's truly for you to decide. Did I love every part of his reply? <em>Absolutely</em>. Mild spoilers ahead by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): The game show element introduced in Chapter 3, hosted by Tenna, has his third round of the show abruptly cancelled. Did you ever have more fleshed out plans for that third round, or were you always planning to cancel it on the poor guy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> We made most of it, but cut it because it slowed down the pacing too much. To put it in words that fans will understand, "Your taking too long" + "the game's getting old."</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e2e85b5b4ead/deltarune.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mr. Tenna, sir, you're hoggin' all the air time — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What drove you to make the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3 a seemingly impossible fight and how do you playtest something so difficult?</strong></p>
<p>You mean Elnina + Lanino? Yeah, there's actually a playtester that gave up at that point... Well, I didn't make it that hard on purpose. But, I did make it so that if you get a Game Over and you have no points and no healing items, you get 2 TV Dinners for free.</p>
<p>After using "ILoveTV" a couple times, it should be enough to beat the battle just by defending and healing, so keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>What sort of music brings you joy these days and what are a few musicians you find yourself listening to? Also, are you aware of the artist Porter Robinson? I feel like you two would make great pals and I'd selfishly love to see how you two could collaborate!</strong></p>
<p>I'm excited for the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_chiptune_band_anamanaguchi_shares_insight_into_its_latest_album_and_dream_smash_bros_fighters">anamanaguchi</a> album, "<a href="https://anamanaguchi.com/">Anyway</a>".</p>
<p>I heard <a href="https://porterrobinson.com/">Porter Robinson</a> before... that's right, the name of the music video was... "<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0">Shelter</a>" <em>(upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)</em></p>
<figure><a title="that's right, the name of the music video was... &quot;Shelter&quot; (upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35a7657aac7df/thats-right-the-name-of-the-music-video-was-shelter-upon-saying-that-word-his-eyes-glaze-over-he-steps-back-into-the-darkness-and-the-door-closes-behind-him.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me."</em> — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How has it been developing for Switch 2 and have you had any thoughts of how you could take advantage of the unique hardware again down the road?</strong></p>
<p>It was kind of like the Nintendo Switch, but a much much bigger number, and strong. Down the road I'd like to take advantage of the unique hardware to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>I can't believe they misspelled "Bananaz" but I'll let it slide because they turned the rock into a girl. I wonder if she was originally intended to stay a rock, but then they realized that she didn't sing rock music, she sang girl music.</p>
<p><strong>How has it felt releasing your story in chunks/chapters like this, as opposed to a fully complete package and when are you personally hoping to have the final chapter of Deltarune release? Are we cursing you by even asking such a question?</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>I've never called them chunks. Maybe I should start calling them chunks? Like, here comes Chunk 5. I mean, that would be great if it was a game about cavemen, like Chuck Rock, or Bonk. That being said, I do feel like calling each episode a "Chapter" really undersells the fact that creating each one is like developing its own game. I've made the equivalent of like 2 and a half Undertales at this point. Continuously.</p>
<p>As for when it comes out, it should be out when it's done, which is as soon as it's finished, which, in my opinion, sooner would be better, but it takes a while. If it takes too long everybody is going to say " you're taking too long" and then I'll say "I'm old!" They'll have to revive me</p>
<figure><a title="When trying to ask Toby about the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3, he seemingly misunderstood us and assumed we meant the Elnina + Lanino fight. Our bad there." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d80979356561f/when-trying-to-ask-toby-about-the-redacted-boss-fight-in-chapter-3-he-seemingly-misunderstood-us-and-assumed-we-meant-the-elnina-plus-lanino-fight-our-bad-there.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>When trying to ask Toby about the REDACTED boss fight in Chapter 3, he...ummm...seemingly misunderstood us and thought we meant the battle with Elnina + Lanino. Whoops! — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<hr>
<p><em>Big thanks to Toby for taking the time away from his never ending development cycle to answer our questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Deltarune is now available on the eShop and currently includes Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can also try the first two chapters for free by downloading the demo. All future chapters will be added to the paid package as and when they release</em></p>

While players continue to pour over the details, they may find a few Easter eggs that were placed in the game by Kojima himself.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Buffing too close to the sun.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is filled with excellent loot for Nightfarers to wield, on your expedition to take down the Nightlords. But how excellent can it get? Well, one player who found a rare weapon and decided to find out has gone viral for building their blade up into the ultimate Nightlord-slaying machine — only to see it also then ultimately tumble back down to nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this centers on Japanese YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mintius" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mintius</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreign-player-pushes-attack-damage-to-very-limit-reaches-godhood-for-a-moment-before-glitching-out-and-becoming-completely-defenseless/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton Media</a>), who acquired the Marais Executioner Sword, a weapon that raises attack power upon defeating enemies — but usually only by a certain amount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Nightreign usually has time limits, thanks to its encroaching storm, this sword's power wouldn't normally have the chance to snowball <em>too </em>far out of control, despite being a strong weapon. But Mintius managed to get the right combination of enemy and encounter spawns to scale it as far as it can go, and then even further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Automaton's translation, Mintius hunted mobs in the Wormface encounter for "about an hour" with the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what would happen. Their attack power hit a damage cap at 9,999 after defeating 725 enemies, with the last damage value he saw as 63,375. After defeating the 727th enemy, though, Mintius was "suddenly unable to deal any damage at all," and got killed.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">「マレー家の執行剣」で1時間ほどミミズ顔の雑魚を狩り続けて検証<br>727体の敵を撃破して攻撃力は9999で余裕のカンスト<br>最後にステータスから確認したマレー家の執行剣の表示攻撃力は63375<br>725体目を撃破したところで、突如として全ての敵へ一切ダメージを与えられない状態になり死亡した <a href="https://t.co/q95neZfdu3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/q95neZfdu3</a></p>— 負けミン mintius (@amabamamabam1) <a href="https://twitter.com/amabamamabam1/status/1937574056943030323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The going theory is that Mintius hit an "overflow," and suddenly went from hitting the damage ceiling to scraping the damage floor. Much like the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nuclear-gandhi-meme-civilization/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet tall-tale about Gandhi in Civilization</a>, hitting the upper-limit may have caused Mintius to wrap back around to the lower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mintius is apparently going to continue testing the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what kind of limits and bounds exist on it, as well as the incredible damage potential behind it. They apparently want to try doing a plunging attack on a Flame Chariot, just to see what kind of damage numbers it can put up. It will probably get wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, maybe take this as a sign to not get <em>too </em>greedy in farming up that Marais Executioner Sword when you find it. Or at least, don't spend an hour doing so. It certainly seems like a good weapon, but it looks like there's some hubris to be found in trying to take it to its highest heights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-takes-a-damage-stacking-weapon-to-its-highest-heights-before-it-all-comes-crashing-down]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A quick one to end the day. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has done a fair-to-miraculous job of reviving enthusiasm for the despised QTE, players remain suspicious of minigame-style mechanics in combat systems - and when I say players I mean <em>you</em>, the people who fretted in the comments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcoms-pragmata-is-a-clean-and-pleasant-lunar-shooter-with-a-touch-of-god-of-war">my recent article on Pragmata</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom’s upcoming space-me-daddo-shooty-doo has a debuff mechanic whereby the android girl riding on your back hacks the robots you’re fighting – a process of moving a cursor around a grid of glyphs to deactivate shields and so forth.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It’s the kind of subtask that may seem annoying on paper. I didn’t find it intrusive during my Summer Game Fest hands-on, but why should you pay attention to me, the melonhead who almost got himself kicked out of the demo session by losing his temper when the PR told him he couldn’t take a picture of the controller diagram print-out? The very same dipstick who then insisted on passive-aggressively drawing the print-out in his notepad, spitefully frittering away five minutes of the session and probably getting himself disinvited from future events? The exact same consummate wellington who has now written all this down for public consumption, just in case those PRs had forgotten?</p>
<p>No, I think you’re better off trying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>’s hacking for yourself care of <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/gameplay/">this brief browser demo</a>. It’s a cursory but solid approximation of the combat system I sampled this month, though obviously it doesn't factor in all the strafing, reloading and such.</p>
<p>I feel pretty positive about Pragmata as a whole, though I doubt it'll set the world on fire. It's a cleanly-built and straightforward shoulder-shooter with just enough intricacy to make you feel clever, even when you're smouldering with outrage and wondering if you can get #Capcomgate trending on Bluesky.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-know-you-fear-minigames-in-your-combat-so-why-not-test-out-pragmatas-hacking-in-a-browser]]></content:encoded>

I had a lot of trouble getting this quest to pop naturally. You’re meant to ask the town of Bravil about rumors, but no one wanted to talk about the ghost plaguing the river to the south. Instead, I went searching on my own. <strong>I found the Forlorn Watchman at Bawnwatch Camp</strong>. After attempting to speak to him, realizing he won’t speak unless you follow him for an hour through the woods, and finally chatting the specter up once he stops, you’ll need wind up back in Bravil for more information after taking a short swim across the river to the <strong>Mouth of the Panther</strong>. Back in Bravil, <strong>speak to Gilgondorin at Silverhome on the Water</strong>—the inn just inside the city’s gates.</p><figure id="" data-id="ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-recommend-id="image://ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a Gloom Wraith with magic in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting a Gloom Wraith with magic in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-recommend-id="image://ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a Gloom Wraith with magic in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gilgondorin will tell you the tale of the lost ship before sending you back to the Emma May. There, you may enter through its cracked and worn siding, closest to the shore. But be wary, because inside <strong>there are numerous Gloom Wraith enemies, completely immune to your usual sword and board playstyle unless you’re wielding potent silver</strong>. I recommend magic!</p><figure id="" data-id="d8521f546102c2d6b369ec79fadb69c8" data-recommend-id="image://d8521f546102c2d6b369ec79fadb69c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Emma May log book reveals what happened in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Emma May log book reveals what happened in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d8521f546102c2d6b369ec79fadb69c8" data-recommend-id="image://d8521f546102c2d6b369ec79fadb69c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Emma May log book reveals what happened in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Down below decks, slaying your way through the feral wraiths, you’ll find a small room with a logbook on the table in the corner. The logbook will give you a little more lore about what happened on the Emma May, specifically the mutiny, which led to the untimely death of our buddy, the Forlorn Watchman.</p><p>Continue forth, brave adventurer!</p><p>On the bottom deck, the Traitor awaits. He’s the cause of the mutiny, and he carries a key that unlocks the backroom, which is where you’ll find Blakely’s corpse. This boy is a bit tougher than the other Gloom Wraiths you fought on the previous decks, so duck and dodge his attacks, get a few swings in with your silver sword, or do what I did: Spam lightning magic until he disintegrates into goop!</p><figure id="" data-id="5bc943366bc6ba2fc9502c36c9ada3d3" data-recommend-id="image://5bc943366bc6ba2fc9502c36c9ada3d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The remains of Blakely, the Forlorn Watchman, in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The remains of Blakely, the Forlorn Watchman, in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5bc943366bc6ba2fc9502c36c9ada3d3" data-recommend-id="image://5bc943366bc6ba2fc9502c36c9ada3d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The remains of Blakely, the Forlorn Watchman, in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Inside, Grantham Blakely’s corpse is chained to a pillar.

Picking it up, you’ll see an ink sketch treasure map pointing you toward a spot further down the roof, between two rocks.</p><p>Upon arriving, you’ll see a small fishing dock jutting out into the water; the treasure chest is underwater, just before you reach the jetty.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="c53ca3fb6620e6c90a6a8af0272ca388" data-recommend-id="image://c53ca3fb6620e6c90a6a8af0272ca388" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the randomized look from the Forlorn Watchman treasure chest in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A look at the randomized look from the Forlorn Watchman treasure chest in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c53ca3fb6620e6c90a6a8af0272ca388" data-recommend-id="image://c53ca3fb6620e6c90a6a8af0272ca388" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the randomized look from the Forlorn Watchman treasure chest in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Inside the chest, you’ll find randomized loot that varies depending on your level.
