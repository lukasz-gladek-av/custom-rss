            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microids has finally announced a release date for Syberia Remastered, a "<em>fully modernized</em>" version of the classic title that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/">first revealed earlier this year</a>. As expected, it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be out on November 6, 2025. What wasn't expected was that it's also making the jump to VR, and will launch on <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/syberia/6794327920669318/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYxnvWd-oUHWGBdjHWbRYZHo7vAEtjwAE69Dtc_vGvS0-jbac">Meta Quest 3</a> headsets a week after its PC and console launch, on November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>Alongside the news of the confirmed release date and the coming VR version, Microids debuted a 'Before/After' trailer that shows off the visual improvements fans of the original can enjoy in this new remaster. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fans looking to keep a piece of this remaster for themselves will also be able to pick up a physical version of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though it's unfortunately only being released physically in the UK.</p>



<p>The story of Syberia follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who sets out to remote parts of the French Alps alongside her companion Oscar to find Hans Voralberg, an inventor obsessed with making a discovery thought to be impossible, to find the last remaining living mammoths on a mythical island, Syberia.</p>



<p>The trailer revealed today focuses on the visual improvements, but fans of the original are likely more interested in seeing what Microids has done regarding the redesigned puzzles, and to see how the quality of life improvements coming in the remaster smooth out the entire Syberia experience.</p>



<p>Now, thankfully, those fans have a date to look forward to that will satisfy their curiosity.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-after-over-20-years.1278129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has announced he's stepping down after over 20 years with the company, and he'll be handing his responsibilities over to another long-time Bungie staffer.</p>

<p>In an announcement on the official Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Parsons says he's "decided to pass the torch" and that now is the "right time for a new beginning", but he doesn't elaborate on his reasons for leaving any further than that.</p>

<p>Parsons will be handing his CEO role over to Justin Truman, who previously served as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s General Manager and the chief development officer of Bungie as a whole. It sounds as though the transition will be instantaneous, since no other date is given.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=XO3gZ-KA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=cEHOpJW5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is vacating his role after over 20 years with the studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Truman begins his own message by reminding fans of his credentials; he worked as a coder for the original&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and served as a designer on&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, crafting many systems for the game (including the endgame mechanisms, which he says he got "terribly wrong" at launch).</p>

<p>He's also been helping Bungie to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, so it's fair to say he's been across everything the studio has worked on for the last ten years or so. It's easy to see why Parsons picked Truman for a successor.</p>

<p>Truman inherits a Bungie that is, to put it charitably, struggling somewhat.&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s rollout isn't exactly going smoothly; the game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in the future</a> following lackluster feedback from the first closed alpha test.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter also found itself in hot water back in May, when it was revealed that artwork used in the game had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">taken from an online artist</a> without permission or compensation (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://x.com/elementj21/status/1671281580831297536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">not the first time</a> Bungie has been caught doing something like this).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=YzZcmiRr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=icAyTbcK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has an uphill battle ahead of it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's all in addition to the fact that the latest&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansion,&nbsp;<em>The Edge of Fate</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3186490/Destiny_2_The_Edge_of_Fate/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hasn't exactly been rapturously received</a>, so it looks like Truman has his work cut out if he wants to turn Bungie's fortunes around. We'll have to wait and see whether he achieves that goal.</p>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia celebrated its 1.0 release yesterday with a remarkably honest behind-the-scenes video from developers Evil Empire, detailing the ups and downs of a year-long Early Access period, including the decision to completely overhaul the game's art style and redesign its purple-skinned protagonist.</p>
<p>The video opens with the admission that this Roguelike take on the wall-jumping, time-rewinding Prince suffered multiple blows upon its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-a-new-roguelite-that-combines-wall-running-with-arkham-style-agile-combat">Early Access release</a> in May 2024. The first of these was the surprise drop of heavyweight <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, which also launched in May and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-devs-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-dodges-hades-2-with-a-release-date-delay">stole most of the Prince's limelight</a>. The second was the negative player response to both the game's lack of content and its colourful visual style, which was inspired by Persian miniature paintings and the artwork of Mœbius/Jean Giraud.</p>

<p>Notably, the decision to give the titular Prince and all NPCs a purple skintone was met with confusion. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKOM1f9KCWQ">developer diary</a> from 2024, it was revealed that this was intended as a direct ode to the PC CGA port of Prince of Persia from 1990, which featured neon skin for all due to a limited 4-colour palette. Unfortunately, this homage went over the heads of most players.</p><p>"During a brainstorming session about skins, our art director had raised a seemingly innocent question," says Evil Empire Marketing Manager Matthew Houghton in the video. "Are we sure that making the Prince purple won't be a problem? At the time, everyone told him no. He was overthinking it; colours are cool, they're stylish, it adds a bit of fantasy! Well...now we all know how that turned out."</p>

</figure>
<p>The rest of the footage details how Evil Empire not only packed The Rogue Prince of Persia with additional content, but also revamped the art style - a decision that is now conveyed in more detailed levels and a decidedly less-purple Prince adorning everything from the game's key art to the album cover of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nE-Q-EmpvPc2YArqWRhFOd60vkNP8WYR4">impressive soundtrack</a> by Persian American musician ASADI. Alas, even this visual update faced unexpected friction in the form of a bizarre Steam issue which required the devs to use a Spanish phone number to get their own product updated.</p>
<p>"Through all those problems and roadblocks," Houghton continues, "we've had a great community giving us a helping hand the whole way. Even when it was clear we had a tonne of work to do, they've been there giving us support, feedback and encouragement. So a special shoutout to you guys for sticking with us on our crazy journey."</p><p>Despite these nice words, throughout the video Houghton acknowledges that the game has faced a low player count during its Early Access. The 1.0 release is now considered final, and throughout the video there does seem to be a slight feeling of "well, we sure hope more folks play this, or else we'll never make a sequel." Which would be a shame, considering that last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> was a superb effort that Ubisoft sent out to die with poor promotion before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">disbanding</a> the team behind it.</p>
<p>I intend on giving the Rogue Prince of Persia a proper go this weekend and am looking forward to it. I also liked the purple Prince look, because I can't help but admire unorthodox art design decisions, especially when they're an ultra-niche homage to computer colour schemes that existed when I was a kid. But I can see how his grape skin along with the game's more cartoony and dreamy original visuals failed to latch onto players, and it does feel as if the final result is actually a tad more reminiscent of the Persian miniature inspiration.</p>
<p>Most of all, however, I'm sticken by the frankness of Evil Empire in this video. Despite taking over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> DLC from Motion Twin, Houghton consistently acknowledges that the team was inexperienced in certain regards, and that this was their first fully-fledged project. It's rare to see admissions of setbacks that aren't couched in corporate industry speak (particularly for a gaming brand owned by Ubisoft). I only hope that the Rogue Prince of Persia manages to catch a few more eyes because of it.</p>

		<p><em>Sleep is overrated. This is what someone tells themselves when it's 4:30 a.m. and your body is fully awake because either believes it's in another part of the world. Sure, it might mean you drink too much coffee today, but hey, who's counting (Your body. Your body is counting.)</em></p><p><em>When Patrick decided to travel to Paris for long enough to feel like he'd lived there, it turns out that also means his body wanted to stay there when he came back, too. Outside of aging, traveling is one of the rare ways to completely upend the way your body senses the world. </em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick decided to reflect on the ways their bodies' rhythms have changed over time. Learn how Rob was almost run over by forklift!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So Rob, when we traveled to London, jet lag wasn’t a thing. Everyone overslept the first few days, sure, but broadly we transitioned over without skipping a beat, thanks to everyone catching a critical few hours of sleep during the overnight flight. It was awesome, and made me optimistic we could make a similar transition coming home. The results are in: absolutely not!</p><p>Handwaving an awful 24-hour stomach bug that made me deeply uncomfortable on the flight home and feeling weirdly feverish overnight, the big problem is that <em>we keep waiting up so early.</em></p><p>The first few days, it didn’t matter when I went to bed. Early. Late. In-between. I’d wake up around 5am. The kids were on the same cycle, too. It’s a seven-hour difference between Chicago and Paris, so apparently our bodies were simply saying “hey, I’d like some lunch.”</p><p>Am I a morning person? Well. I’m not <em>not</em> a morning person—but I really, really enjoy my sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m also not a person who usually has trouble falling back asleep after briefly stirring awake?</p><p>But there was no going back to sleep during these moments, so instead of being frustrated, I woke up and got on with it. The consequences of lacking sleep were a problem for a future version of Patrick. It was in these early hours, as the sun slowly peered out, that I found a lot of enjoyable solace in—excuse the grindset term—”attacking” the day. I surfed through a series of indie games—<em>Sword of the Sea, Herdling</em>—because of the extra quiet time I had in these hours.</p><p>Honestly, the biggest problem was pumping the breaks on my coffee intake. I’m used to taking down two cups of coffee in the day’s opening hours—one while prepping the kids for the day, another slowly sipped while heading towards lunch—and I’d downed both of ‘em before 8am.</p><p>I can feel my normal routine slipping back into place, though. Days ago, I couldn’t make it past 9pm. Last night, I caught up on episodes of <em>Alien: Earth </em>until nearly midnight. I slept until nearly 7am this morning. My brief moment of hacking the universe and getting 2x grindset morning returns appears to be fading. Of course, I could just set an alarm and get up earlier. But that would require making a conscious effort to get up early, not respond to my body demanding it.</p><p>Are there moments in your life where your daily routine, whether it’s when you wake up or otherwise, suddenly shifted? I found this shift, however temporary, to be very pleasant. I’m not sure I’m prepared to sleep early enough to make it happen, but I very much get the appeal of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joyceromero?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Joyce Romero</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Probably the most intense version of this I had to deal with was when I worked at a factory where your crew rotated through shifts. You’d have a week of day shift, a week of swing shift, and then a week of night shift. It made it a lot easier to work the night shift but at the cost of just making time itself seem blurry. You’d wrap work at midnight and suddenly you’re hanging with friends until two or three in the morning like it’s nothing. Then the next thing you know you’re going on a date at five in the afternoon, going into work at 11:30, and coming home to have breakfast with your family before you go to bed. There were times it was kind of liberating to be completely divorced from any kind of normal daily routine, to just be doing whatever you wanted or needed to do whenever you had the chance outside work hours.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, I don’t think I ever felt like I was fully rested and healthy while I was doing that, and a <em>lot </em>of people I worked with were taking drugs to sand off the edges of exhaustion or overstimulation. I remember one forklift driver kept having accidents because she was jacked-up all the time, and we busted ass trying to conceal how bad and dangerous the situation had gotten. She’d nearly run you over with a shipping pallet, then she’d scatter the whole load a second later trying to take a turn too fast and we’d swarm her trying to get everything cleaned-up before the foreman could notice. Nobody liked her that much: you can only have someone come inches from inflicting grievous bodily harm so many times before you get righteously pissed about it… but nobody wanted her to get fired. And I think everyone was aware that if management got concerned about the stimulants people were taking as a matter of course, it would cause a <em>lot </em>of problems beyond one forklift operator.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview-my-exclusive-first-look-at-harlowe-gameplay.1278117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been rinsing the Borderlands series, which prepared me quite nicely for an extended demo of Borderlands 4 at  Gamescom. However, my preparation was rendered mostly insignificant when I discovered just <strong>how much of an evolution Borderlands 4 is </strong>over Borderlands 3 (and the rest of the series).</p>



<p>As I explored the seamless and sumptuous open world of Kairos with Harlowe, the ‘Gravitar’ Vault Hunter, I found myself marvelling at the sheer level of differences that set Borderlands 4 apart from everything that came before, while still managing to retain most of what makes Borderlands <em>Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full Borderlands 4 preview, pieced together from an exclusive, never-before-seen demo at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Before you dive in, here are 35 minutes of Borderlands 4 gameplay, featuring Harlowe:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="35 Minutes of Borderlands 4 Gameplay | Exclusive First Look at Harlowe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XK2qNsnKLqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-border-more-lands">Less Border, More Lands</h2>







<p>Borderlands 4 has a stunning open world that’s the biggest single environment Gearbox has created in the 20-year history of the franchise. It’s a hugely ambitious undertaking that reflects nothing but the sharpest quality. The classic cartoon visuals of Borderlands 4 are more detailed than ever before, allowing players to study the most minute elements of this enormous map.</p>



<p>To accommodate the size and scale of Kairos, Gearbox has created a Borderlands game that has more traversal options than you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/">shake 30 billion guns at</a>. From grapple hooks and gliders to double-jump mechanics and multiple customizable vehicles, there’s no shortage of ways to get around this vast map.</p>



<p>Those elements feed into the game’s combat sequences, too. I found myself flying around the battlefield as Harlowe, employing powerful gadgets to hold enemies in stasis or blast them with an incredible launcher that corroded them from the inside out. It’s easy to never stop moving in Borderlands 4, which is great, as you’ll be digging through the map for <strong>many, many hours</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-humor-but-different">Humor, But Different</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a pre-demo presentation, I learned from Gearbox that the traditional humorous elements of Borderlands are still present in Borderlands 4, but they’ve been toned down a little to reflect the tone of the game. I still had a chuckle at some of the more entertaining character introductions and dialogue choices, though.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop around the campaign has also been altered, going from a mostly linear path to a truly flexible, sandbox-based RPG. You’re free to do what you want, when you want, where you want, and that suits me down to the ground. It has been revealed by Randy Pitchford that Borderlands 4 has immensely tough bosses, so you’ll want to grind and level up before challenging them.</p>



<p>From a technical perspective, I played Borderlands 4 on both controller and with a keyboard and mouse, and both inputs were accessible, enjoyable, and familiar. I didn’t experience a single bug in an hour, the game rendered and ran beautifully, and the weapon variation and abilities popped nicely.</p>



<p>The same old weapons manufacturers are present, but new ones have been added to the mix, and cross-licensing now happens, bringing one brand’s parts and abilities to other weapons – at a cost. Vehicles can be deployed from anywhere, the skill paths are varied and support multiple styles, and customization has been improved.</p>



<p>Like I said, it feels like an entirely new game, but it still takes a few key elements from the older titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-officially-a-contender">Officially a Contender</h2>

<p>I’d say that Borderlands 4 is a contender for Game of the Year. Given how strong the year has been for me thus far, that’s not a light statement. I was overwhelmingly impressed by Borderlands 4 during my preview at Gamescom, and one hour of gameplay wasn’t enough for me.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love that Randy Pitchford</a> has for this game is so clear and tangible, which also fills me with faith for the road ahead.</p>



<p>Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum you think about Borderlands 4 and whether you’ll be getting it on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait for Crimson Desert keeps getting longer, and players have been patient since 2019 to finally see the game in action. As we wait, Insider Gaming had the chance to play the preview build for Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, and here are our early thoughts on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world action adventure set on the continent of Pywel. Players take on the role of Kliff, the leader of the Greymanes, as they explore this beautiful yet brutal landscape, defending Pywel from all types of foes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-complicated-yet-exciting-combat">Complicated Yet Exciting Combat</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Crimson Desert preview build was around 50 minutes long, which was easily one of the longest demos at the event. During this time, players received a comprehensive tutorial on combat and movement, experienced a war sequence, and engaged in a proper boss fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right from the get-go, youre introduced to a variety of moves and skills, and that’s just with one weapon. You can get in all types of different combos and special moves by using different button combinations. However, this game is not a button masher, and repeating the same moves might get you through the minions, but you really need to know your skillset when taking on the bosses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players were only able to face one faction during the preview, which featured several enemy times. Some were small and quick, inflicting relatively minor damage at once but causing more damage over time. The other type was big and slow, but could unleash some hefty blows at the same time. </p>



<p>The boss is an entirely different matter—a true monster who could eliminate you in an instant if you found yourself cornered. There’s a specific system in place, and if you’re not adhering to it, you’ll find yourself in a challenging situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-great-blend-of-magic-and-brute-force-nbsp">A Great Blend of Magic and Brute Force&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Combat heavily relies on melee combat, but it’s blended with several magic-based skills. You were able to access three different types of elements in the preview build: Fire, Freeze, and Thunder, which can be used to enchant your weapons and deal some mighty blows to the enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had access to two different types of arrows, too, for ranged attacks. One of the other weapons could be imbued with one of your chosen elements to inflict damage as well as a status effect on the enemies. The other arrow called for a barrage of raining fire arrows from the sky, damaging masses of enemies at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took me some time to get used to all the attacks and abilities they had to offer, but once things started going, I was having a whole lot of fun. I was slashing one enemy, stabbing another; I think I even pulled off a WWE move once, smacking the enemy straight down into the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-visual-treat-nbsp">A Visual Treat&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The graphics and performance of Crimson Desert were brilliant, at least for a preview build. <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pearl Abyss</a> brings players to an intriguing fantasy world, which is filled with all types of flora and fauna. The world feels massive, although I was only able to explore a tiny part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive world, you need to have different ways to traverse, and the game offers several. Of course, like most games, you can jump and sprint wherever you need to go, and there are plenty of climbable surfaces. On top of that, the main character has a floating/gliding ability, which can be used to cover a lot of distance when dropping from heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You also have a trusty steed, like most fantasy games. However, the horse’s movement felt very clunky and slow; it needs a bit of work. Sprinting was almost always faster to get to a location.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert has excellent potential and has a lot going for it. It will be the perfect title for players who are looking to sink their teeth into a new fantasy adventure. Combat is extensive and complex. It can be unforgiving at times, especially with the bosses, if you don’t know your way around it.&nbsp;It isn’t a Soulslike game, but it will require some effort from casual gamers.</p>



<p>However, there was not a lot to explore in Crimson Desert’s open world, so it’s hard to tell how it’s shaping up or if it feels lived in. At the same time, if the developers have put in the same amount of attention to detail with the world design as they have with combat, then players have a solid experience waiting for them.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><span>Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.2 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” will launch on September 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-987401"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>After thwarting the Exaltists’ conspiracy previously, the Defense Force dispatches the Obol Squad to join the conflict, introducing the new agents Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus. With trustworthy allies and various in-game events, Proxies will get to delve deeper into the power struggles in New Eridu and uncover the past of the familiar yet fresh faction, the Obol Squad.</p><p>The Defense Force’s intervention—spearheaded by Major General Lorenz and commanded by Colonel Isolde—throws Waifei Peninsula’s power struggles into even more turbulent waters. Beyond eliminating the Exaltists’ remnants, the Obol Squad will also uncover long-buried truths and reveal the hidden stories behind team member Seed’s mysterious past and inner world.</p><p>As a genius mechanic, the S-Rank Electric Attack Agent Seed has transformed the Seed Sr. mecha into a formidable partner with overwhelming firepower and suppression capabilities. Seed excels in synergizing with other Attack agents to enhance the team’s sustained damage output. Orphie &amp; Magus, the S-Rank Fire Attack Agent and Obol Squad’s captain, excels in coordinated team combat using powerful lasers. Through EX Special Attack that assists allies, Orphie can accumulate Bottled Heat, and place all squad members into the Zeroed In state upon hitting enemies, boosting Attack and allowing Aftershocks to ignore a portion of the enemy’s Defense. Joining the stellar lineup is Mercury, the outstanding S-Rank Bangboo who operates a tank as combat support on the battlefield. S-Rank Electric Stun Agent Trigger and S-Rank Fire Attack Agent Evelyn will return in Version 2.2. Additionally, Soldier 0 – Anby is currently undergoing intensive training, and Proxies can expect her to return even stronger with her activated potential in future versions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_987402"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As for events, the Bangboo tower defense event Band of Brave Bangboo will come with new maps, enemies, and mechanics, including bushes and Miasmic environment. Successfully clearing stages will reward Proxies with the A-Rank Excaliboo. This Bangboo will attempt to draw his holy sword before attacking—success results in powerful sword strikes, while failure leads to determined hammer attacks against opponents. For lighter entertainment, the Rhythm Rave event challenges Proxies to sync beats with classic tracks and earn abundant in-game rewards.</p><p>Continuous optimizations has also been implemented to further improve player experience. For example, Proxies can now choose between Belle or Wise before starting companion events such as Quality Time invites.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.2 special program below.

                <p>Unlike past Call of Duty games, this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will not allow players to choose a difficulty level <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">for the campaign</a>. Associate creative director Miles Leslie said that the difficulty scale for Black Ops 7 is "baked in" as opposed to being something a player can choose.</p><p>The reason for this comes down to how Black Ops 7's campaign can be played in co-op.</p>

<p>"We've built it for solo or four-player squads as well. You cannot pick a difficulty like past games. We've baked it in because you have to approach a co-op campaign differently, and we wanted to make sure the missions felt right for solo players," Leslie told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>For players who enjoy a solo experience, Leslie said, "We're not forgetting about you; we love you." However, Black Ops 7's campaign was designed to be a "social experience."</p><p>"We want to make sure it's fun, but the right amount of challenging for two, three, and four players as well," Leslie said.</p><p>Call of Duty's difficulty levels over the years have included things like Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran, along with a super-challenging Realism mode.</p><p>For Black Ops 7, the campaign difficulty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">will scale when playing co-op</a>, meaning partying up with friends doesn't necessarily make it easier, and teamwork is needed to get through missions.</p><p>Another thing that's new for Black Ops 7's campaign is how XP progression from the campaign is connected to multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. Additionally, Black Ops 7's campaign closes with a mission called "Avalon Endgame," which is described as a "brand-new, replayable experience where you and your squad will need to survive overwhelming odds, adapt under pressure, and break the rules of what you thought a Black Ops campaign could be."</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta will be held in October. </a>The game is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox, and PC, and it'll be included with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at Gamescom 2025 has ignited a wealth of excitement for the upcoming title from TT Games, and we’ve gathered everything we know about the release date.</p>



<p>Revealed as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next LEGO title from TT Games</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight impressed us during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, although some eyebrows have been raised with marketing stating that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only seven playable characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to be revealed about LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and, if you want to begin your countdown to release, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-a-release-date">Does LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have a Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire up the Bat Signal. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, a precise release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has not been shared by TT Games.</strong></p>



<p>After being revealed at Gamescom, it’s understandable that players are keen to know exactly when they will be able to get their hands on the title, but there’s going to be a bit of a wait before those details become available.</p>



<p>In fact, don’t expect a precise release date to be shared this year, given the release window that has been issued is pretty broad.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-window">What is The LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Release Window?</h2>



<p><strong>TT Games announced at Gamescom, following the reveal of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, that the release window for the title is 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, no specific month or season for <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/article/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>‘s launch has been shared, resulting in a pretty broad window, but there are some trends that could be followed.</p>



<p>For example, Grand Theft Auto 6 is looming large in 2026 with a release date in May, and most, if not all, developers will want to avoid going head-to-head against the titan, giving it is expected to be one of the biggest gaming launches of all time.</p>



<p>Although LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was released in April 2022, that was an outlier in TT Games’ history, as, traditionally, releases have come in May/June or September/October/November.</p>



<p>In 2018, LEGO: DC Super-Villains was released in October, while in 2017, LEGO: Marvel Superheroes 2 was released in November. Going back further, LEGO Dimensions was released in September 2015, and LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released in November 2014.</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t clear the release window up exactly, it does mean that TT Games’ previous schedule suggests we won’t see LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight in the first half of 2026.</p>

Studio head Nikita Buyanov subsequently confirmed the date on his X account.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">15.11.2025<br>1.0 release<br>Let’s gooooooo!</p>  — Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Very little was shared about what will be included in Escape From Tarkov version 1.0. Presumably it will have some story content as well as refined maps, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. But absent any firm details from Battlestate Games, we can only speculate.</p><p>Battlestate Games has kept a community of Escape From Tarkov players together for over eight years. However, there have been some issues that caused friction between the studio and its fans. After releasing a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC, Battlestate Games released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p><p>Escape From Tarkov is only available to play on PC and can be found on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

                <p>2025 has already been a banner year for Nightdive Studios, the team behind the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heretic-plus-hexen/" data-ref-id="5000-689540">Heretic + Hexen</a> remaster. The studio has made its name by giving classic games a modern coat of paint. One of the titles that Nightdive Studios CEO Stephen Kick is still eager to get his hands on is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-2569">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a>, which has only ever been released on GameCube back in 2002.</p><p>Kick shared his desire to revisit Eternal Darkness during a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRbxQmqRenc&amp;t=431s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shacknews </a>(via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nightdives-ceo-reiterates-desire-to-remaster-eternal-darkness" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>). But since the rights to the game are fully owned by Nintendo, it may never get an official re-release.</p><p>"[Eternal Darkness has] been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time, and it's something that I would personally love to see get re-released," Kick said. </p><p>Silicon Knights developed Eternal Darkness, which was the first M-rated game published by Nintendo. Although the game wasn't considered a survival-horror title, it did have horror elements and a unique way of messing with players through sanity effects that were meant to break the fourth wall.</p><p>Eternal Darkness director Denis Dyack made multiple attempts to develop a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/shadow-of-the-eternals/" data-ref-id="false">Shadow of the Eternals</a>. However, two separate crowdfunding initiatives fell short and production of the game was ultimately shut down.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-remake-dev-is-trying-very-hard-to-rev/1100-6480003/" data-ref-id="1100-6480003">previously shared his desire</a> to revive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever/" data-ref-id="5000-2505">The Operative: No One Lives Forever</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-one-lives-forever-2-a-spy-in-harms-way/" data-ref-id="5000-3854">No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way</a>. During the Shacknews interview, Kick reiterated that those games remain a priority for him. However, the rights to that franchise have been difficult to untangle for the last two decades.</p><p>Nightdive's next release, Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, will hit Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 20.</p>

                <p>Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford has predicted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will push the franchise's total sales numbers to a new stratosphere: 100 million units. Speaking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford said plainly, "We will break 100 million units with this launch, easily, all in, with the franchise."</p><p>That's not actually a very bold prediction. The series currently stands at <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 94 million units</a>, so Pitchford is predicting sales of at least 6 million for Borderlands 4. By comparison, Borderlands 3 sold more than 23 million copies and is 2K's fastest-selling game ever. The top-selling game of all time for 2K is Borderlands 2, which has achieved sales of more than 30 million units.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - 20 Minutes of Siren Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Not many video game franchises have reached 100 million units sold. If Borderlands 4 can help push the series to that level, Borderlands would join the likes of GTA, Red Dead, Pokemon, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Final Fantasy, and Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Pitchford said in the interview that when he was first trying to sell Borderlands, he had to "scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it." Back then, Pitchford said "nobody cared" about Borderlands and that, "A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn't going to work."</p><p>Prior to Borderlands coming on the scene in 2009, Gearbox was better known for the WW2 FPS series Brothers in Arms, along with Half-Life expansion packs. Borderlands became a gigantic success, and the franchise remains strong.</p><p>"We went from an industry that predicted that we would die--that Borderlands would find no audience--to being one of the leading video game franchises in the world. And it's kind of humbling, frankly, to be a part of it," Pitchford told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-the-game-industry-once-expected-a-genre-experiment-like-borderlands-to-die-but-it-actually-became-one-of-the-leading-video-game-franchises-in-the-world-its-kind-of-humbling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Switch 2 edition coming in October. A major point of online discussion about Borderlands 4 has been its price--which is $70. Pitchford said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">delivers so much value that it would still be worth it if 2K charged $350.</a></p>

<p>And it's looking gooey</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It only feels like yesterday that Bloober Team confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> would be launching on the Switch 2. Yet here we are, merely a couple of weeks from its <strong>5th September</strong> release, and the lovely Felix has gone hands-on with the title during his stint at Gamescom (yes, Felix said it's out on the 4th, but it's been a very busy week for him).</p>
<p>Despite some initial confusion around his appointment, Felix got to spend a decent chunk of time with Cronos and came away feeling pretty good about the whole thing. The demo showcased some solid survival horror gameplay in which creepy creatures would merge with corpses to form all new types of monstrosities, all of which are simply <em>begging</em> to be put out of their misery.</p>
<p>It's important to note with the Switch 2 version that the game runs at 30fps with some key visual downgrades when compared to the likes of the PC and PS5. That said, it still looks pretty decent, and Bloober Team's fantastic work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake gives us high hopes for this one.</p>
<p>If you're more keen on checking out some direct-feed gameplay with no commentary, then good news, because we also have that for you just below. Enjoy!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE has outlined what it's learned — and what it's changing — following the open beta test for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With "tens of thousands connecting on Discord to play together, over 600,000 hours streamed, and over 30 million hours watched," the Battlefield team said it would "like to take a moment to look back at the recent Open Beta to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwddm7/battlefield_6_community_update_open_beta_debrief/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share our key learnings</a> and in-game changes we’re making based on your feedback and in-game data," including tweaks to weapons, movement, maps, modes, player counts, and playlist options.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwdur5/movement_will_be_changed_for_the_final_release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>biggest complaints from players</u></a> was around movement mechanics, particularly the speed of movement, and moving out of a slide into a jump. DICE says it's now "adjusting" this "to create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced," the team wrote. "There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy. These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Parachute physics have also been re-tuned, with reduced initial acceleration when opening the parachute for more controlled aerial movement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team was also keen for you to know that it heard your "strong feedback" about larger-scale maps, and says that while the Open Beta intentionally featured smaller, more fast-paced maps, "larger-scale maps are already part of our package, delivering action-packed gameplay and memorable, unique moments for every player." As Battlefield Labs continues — that's the closed test available to select players who sign an NDA — it'll introduce two new multiplayer maps: one set in Mirak Valley, the other a remake of the fan-favorite from Battlefield 3, Operation Firestorm. These two maps "include the full complement of vehicles, like Liberation Peak, along with a more vast combat space." Details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/much-bigger-battlefield-6-maps-leak-online-following-datamine"><u>Mirak, you may remember, leaked earlier this week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, the studio is looking at feedback on modes, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-knows-you-dont-like-rush-mode-and-has-already-cut-mcom-timers-by-33"><u>DICE recently made changes to Rush mode after a negative response from fans</u></a>, noting "the conversation we observed wasn’t just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't aware, Rush was initially known as Gold Rush in Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve experimented with larger player counts over the years, such as 64- and even 128-player versions. While these matches created intense, fast-paced moments, they also led to issues: Overwhelming defenses, stalled frontlines, and too many games ending in the first sector," DICE explained. "Rush is especially sensitive to higher player counts due to its tactical and strategic requirements; when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible. Based on feedback throughout recent titles, we’re lowering the default player count for Rush to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who enjoy a "large-scale" Rush, however, will still be able to "experiment" with different player counts via the Portal from launch. "Finding the right balance is an ongoing process as everyone gets familiar with map size, lanes, and combat spaces," the team added. "For now, we’ve found that 8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and KOTH."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the insights gathered during the Open Beta play sessions, we will be introducing in-game adjustments in upcoming Battlefield Labs events. Stay tuned for progress updates and future opportunities to get involved," the team concluded. "Lastly, thanks again for joining the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. Your feedback and participation made it an incredible experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "We are still in the beta period, but I’m already having an absolute blast with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer. The action is sublime, with a cinematic quality to the constantly raining debris that is enhanced by how legitimately effective it is to take strategic advantage of that destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget that from now until October 7 — Battlefield 6's launch day — EA has a "wave of content" planned for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042"><u>Battlefield 2042</u></a>, including a free new pass "celebrating the legacy of Battlefield," new hardware, and a reimagining of the fan favorite Iwo Jima map. As you progress through the 'Road to Battlefield 6' pass, you can expect 50 "exclusive cross-rewards," including 20 for Battlefield 6 that will be ready for you on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>Docked and loaded</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, we were lucky enough to head to the Nintendo booth at Gamescom and go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">hands-on</a> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2. Bandai Namco didn't allow any footage to be recorded from our handheld session (and we quickly saw why), but it seems such recording rules are not in place at Canada's <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/">Fan Expo</a>, which kicked off yesterday and was allowing over-the-shoulder recording of the docked demos.</p>
<p>One visitor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MDee14">MDee14</a>, recorded footage of their entire play session and has quickly shared it online, giving us our first proper look at how this thing runs when the Switch 2 is up on a big screen. Fortunately, it looks better than the handheld offering seems to be.</p>
<p>The video (above) shows the attendee's entire preview session, from the opening tutorial section to some early exploration around Limgrave. The performance is far from what you'd expect to see on a PS5, but it seems to hold up <em>pretty</em> well, with the noticeable drops coming from big sequences like the opening of the Limgrave gate. Things seem okay otherwise, but let's bear in mind that this kind of over-the-shoulder footage isn't always the best way to see every little detail.</p>
<p>Our brief hands-on time with the game in handheld told a very different story. It looks like docked mode might be the way to go with this one (at least, in whatever build is being shown in expos at the moment), as our handheld play was plagued with hefty frame drops and stutters a-plenty — though no capture was allowed for these sessions, naturally.</p>
<p>We're still waiting on a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, but let's hope that we don't have too long to wait before we can see the launch performance really put through its paces.</p>

Developed by former Lionhead (Fable) and Media Molecule (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>) developers, Glowmade's game will feature over a hundred dungeons at launch for 1-4 players to complete, filled with battles and traps. Then, players will be able to create their own dungeons and upload for the community to play.
</p>
<p>
King of Meat will be released across PC (Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and cost £23.95 for the standard edition (or £39.95 for the deluxe edition featuring extra cosmetics).

<p>
Ahead of release, Glowmade has stressed the game is not pay-to-win, with all purchases being optional cosmetics, and doesn't include any form of random monetisation like loot boxes.
</p>
<p>
Future updates will also be free for those with the base game, though post-launch content is yet to be divulged.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for those intrigued, a technical test will run this weekend from 23rd - 24th August on all three platforms - simply search for the game on your platform of choice.

            <title><![CDATA[Rogue Point Preview – When tactical shooting goes rogue…]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/rogue-point-preview-when-tactical-shooting-goes-rogue/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rogue-point-preview-%E2%80%93-when-tactical-shooting-goes-rogue%E2%80%A6.1278024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s something special about tactical shooters that the more hyperactive likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield simply can’t match. The tension of knowing that every corner and doorway could hold a swift end to your mission, the close camaraderie of working through a scenario with friends, the elation of coming out on top. Now blend that, in a somewhat lightened form, with the brinksmanship of a roguelite and you’ve got Rogue Point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy039nGgwj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the team behind Black Mesa, the four player tactical action of Rogue Point is a rather different project for Crowbar Collective. To be clear, this isn’t a hard-nosed tactical shooter in the vein of classic Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and modern Ready or Not, but it holds onto that same general tone and mission structure in a way that should appeal to the same audience, just with the need to string successful missions together and the threat of losing everything and starting over.</p>


<p>There’s some neat touches in the planning phase: as a mission map is presented to you, highlighting the objective areas that you’ll need to scour — naturally these are randomised alongside the enemy placement — and you’re able to doodle and draw to quickly plan out a mission. I’ve no doubt that, after 3 or 4 stages, these discussions could get very serious.</p>
<p>Alongside that, there’s loadout adjustments, but being a roguelite naturally imposes some restrictions here. You’ll only have a limited initial pool of cash to spend on guns and gear initially, with more kit coming through both run and metagame unlocks. You do have an option to gamble though, dropping $500 on a mystery crate that could be just what you want or force you into a different playstyle and role.</p>


<p>Naturally you want to try and have loadouts and builds that compliment one another, but there’s a great co-op feature in the form of backpack items. Instead of tucking things like health kits away in your pocket for you and only you to use and activate, here they are held in your backpack, and anyone and everyone on your squad and wander up and grab something they need.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s also that sharing spirit between missions. If you die on a mission but your teammates are able to complete it, you will have lost all the gear you took in, but they’ll be fully equipped. To try and get you back up to speed, your group can share their inventory, helping even out your builds again.</p>
<p>A lot of a tactical shooter’s vibe relies on the quality of the AI, and Rogue Point’s exhibits different characteristics and behaviours. The standard grunts will blast away and take cover where necessary, but berserker AI will just rush you and close the gap. Heavies are the more armoured foes, but the most interesting is the lookouts, who will be keen to retreat and back away from you. How you approach them is vital, and end with a face full of lead if you mess up, as kicking down a door will require three hefty kicks alerting anyone on the other side in the process.</p>

<p>There’s always a tricky balance to strike between accuracy, aggressiveness and other traits, which Crowbar Collective will tweak right up to and after release. From what we saw at Gamescom, it looks to be quite forgiving to start with, at least. Health kits will a literal lifesaver, but you can probably take a couple more hits than in Ready or Not.</p>
<p>Each mission builds up to an extraction after successfully completing the main objectives, where you have that tense wait and defensive action to hold on until you can get away. Here the game can spawn in more enemies to spice things up again, though I do wonder if this could be over-egging the pudding.</p>
<p>The challenge of each roguelite run will escalate as you complete stages and missions, and you have a set number of mission failures before it’s game over. They can break down levels into smaller areas for early missions, so perhaps just the lower floor of the oil rig, as opposed to the full complex. Add to that the player choice between what missions you take on, with a higher challenge rating promising greater bonuses at the end, and there’s some real risk and reward here.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is a really fascinating blend of tactical shooter and roguelite — two styles of game that, the more I think about it, have a lot of common ground. I’m keen to see how it all comes together as it heads to Steam Early Access later this year.</p>

<p>"I hoped it would be you, little brother"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Netflix has debuted its teaser trailer for the upcoming second season of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong>, the animated adaptation of Capcom's acclaimed action series.</p>
<p>Due for release in <strong>2026</strong>, the anime is seemingly putting the spotlight on Dante's brother, Virgil, setting up a big showdown between the two character's following the latter's last-minute appearance in the previous season.</p>
<p>It's unclear how much time has passed since the first season, but you can see that Dante himself is sporting slightly longer locks while rocking the more traditional, long-sleeved red trench coat. Pretty badass.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's now been over six years since the last mainline game title, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a>, launched in 2019, with a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/devil_may_cry_5_special_edition">Special Edition</a> following in 2020. We're hopeful that a Switch 2 port may crop up at some point, but with veteran director <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/capcoms-hideaki-itsuno-leaves-after-30-years-starts-new-role-in-september">Hideaki Itsuno leaving Capcom in 2024</a>, it's unclear at this stage what the future holds regarding brand new entries.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has brought back the secret Guy Savage mode within the remake. But it turns out this mode wasn't made by Konami alone - Platinum Games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Astral Chain) is responsible for the surprise action minigame.</p>
<p>The Guy Savage mode can be played by saving the game and exiting to the menu directly after the torture scene deep into the game. When you re-launch the game, the Guy Savage minigame will start. Alternatively, beat the game and the minigame will be accessible.</p>
<p>Guy Savage was originally based on a <a href="https://x.com/Arc_Hound/status/1054458915851788289">cancelled prototype for Zone of the Enders 3 / Anubis 2</a> which was snuck into the original Metal Gear Solid 3. In Delta, <em>every</em> little Easter egg and trick has been recreated. The same goes for minigames, with Snake vs Monkey coming back (with a surprise appearance from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>).</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an incredibly faithful recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's review states</a>: "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is faithful, it's a church dedicated to one of gaming's best stealth games. Updates to how the game plays are subtle, and in regard to the new gameplay style, totally optional. So much is left untouched, and that's for the best. Add in some original art, some obscure modes, and let her loose."</p>

<p>The long wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching a conclusion after a release date for the title was finally announced after years of waiting.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, bringing an end to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of development</a>, and the desire to get hands-on with the game is understandable, with our verdict being that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is worth the wait</a>.</p>



<p>Now, players around the world are preparing for the launch and want to know if pre-orders are available, which we’ve got all the details for here.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-available-to-pre-order">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Available to Pre-Order?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready? Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <strong>is not currently available to pre-order or purchase on any storefront.</strong></p>



<p>With the long-awaited release date of the title on the horizon, the desire to secure a copy of Hollow Knight: Silksong is understandable. However, for the time being at least, you’ll need to be patient for a little while longer for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<p>None of the platforms where Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently available has pre-orders listed. However, those with an Xbox Game Pass subscription can add the title to their ‘Play Later’ section, which should pre-download the full game before release.</p>



<p>That will likely change as the release date of September 4 edges closer, so keep an eye out for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-preload-hollow-knight-silksong">Can You Preload Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong is not currently available on any platform, though this will likely change as the release date approaches.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, storefronts do not currently have Hollow Knight: Silksong listed and available to purchase, which means that preloading the title is also out of the question for the time being.</p>



<p>The closest option to preloading currently available is through the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft store</a>, which has a ‘Get Game Pass’ button beneath the title alongside a note that confirms the title is “coming soon to Game Pass.” If you already have Game Pass, clicking this option will provide details of your subscription.</p>



<p>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong in full should be an available option provided before the launch period, and, with less than two weeks until the title releases at the time of writing, it shouldn’t be a long wait.</p>



<p>Will Hollow Knight: Silksong live up to the hype and be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
If I had to make a list of the things in life I have absolutely no interest in, trucks would be pretty near the top. And yet, I am <em>obsessed</em> with developer SCS Software's Truck Simulator series of games. And so, following the news both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are at long last making their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, I'm here to convince you their soothing expanses of endless virtual highway might also be for you, even if you don't know your backhaul from your bill of lading.
</p>
<p>
The downside to this whole not-being-into-trucks thing is, of course, that I'm a terrible guide through the series if you're here for proper hobbyist reasons, so apologies in advance. For me, though, the appeal is not so much the allure of a Hopper Body and the promise of a lubricated Glad Hand, as it is the pure ASMR pleasures of hours spent in empty minded tranquility with naught for company but the swoosh of scenic vistas, the tick of an indicator, the quiet hum of an air-conditioned cabin, and the lulling rumble of rubber on road.
</p>
<p>
I'm being a little reductive, admittedly. Well, a lot actually. Even without delving deep into the Truck Simulator games' more specialist particulars, there's a lot to love. There's the fundamental progression system that sees you doing odd jobs in loaned trucks and then scrambling up the XP tree to unlock new missions, or stockpiling enough cash that you're able to buy your own truck, even start your own business with your own HQ. It's not necessarily a particularly flashy package, but its basic structure is sound enough that it provides an additional layer of focus to your life on the open road. Chuck in the kind of cabin customisation that lets you scatter tatty souvenirs and pizza boxes around the place (honestly, I love this kind of nonsense), occasional community events, and a multiplayer mode enabling up to eight friends to form a convoy - a wonderfully, surprisingly hilarious recipe for chaos with the right (or wrong, depending on your perspective) people - and it's brilliantly compelling, even if you don't give a truck about trailers and the like.

As for the different flavours of sim coming to Xbox and PlayStation, both - if you're not already aware - are fundamentally the same experience, just with a very obvious change of scenery between them. Personally, I'm far more partial to the big skies and breathtaking wilderness of American Truck Simulator than its European counterpart (the sheer uncanny weirdness of ETS2's deeply unconvincing UK expansion was a bit of a turn-off when I tried it a fair few years back), but your mileage - no pun intended - will almost certainly vary.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/08/in-case-you-missed-it-future-games-show.html">SCS' Truck Simulator console announcement</a> is almost completely devoid of specifics, so pretty much all we can say with certainty right now is that ATS and ETS 2 are on the way. I'd assume both will be pretty close to their PC counterparts (minus, perhaps, extended peripheral support and mod availability), especially after all the work SCS has done to improve controller support and upgrade the interface over time. It will, though, be interesting to see how the studio handles the games' years of paid cosmetic, truck, and map expansion DLC. A couple of free packs-ins to help consoles catch up? Starter bundles? Nothing of the sort? Time will reveal all.

So there you go; American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are finally making their way to Xbox Series X/S and PS5. And if the thought of the open road and an endless shifting horizon stirs even the faintest twinge of latent yearning, you'd do well to lean in. You too might discover a love for a virtual four-wheeled life of adventure hitherto unknown.
