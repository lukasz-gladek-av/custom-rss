		<p>I hope you’ve all been making good progress on your Advent calendars, whether it’s a simple chocolately one – perhaps grabbed on clearance now that we’re over a quarter of the way through it – a bougie savoury farm shop one, or one that’s filled with treats for your cat or dog.</p>
<p>Christmas has come early (or is coming early) for Xbox gamers and Indiana Jones fans, with MachineGames doing a great job in retranslating the whole archeological action adventure as a first person game instead of a third person adventure.</p>
<p>But first, let’s check in on the news.</p>

To enhance the horror experience, the game features a distinctive art style characterized by strong contrasts of light and shadow, inspired by the works of Shigeru Mizuki, the creator of <em>GeGeGe no Kitaro</em>. The lurking Yokai emerging from the dark greatly heightens the sense of dread.</li><li><strong>Dealing With the Curse That Undermines Players</strong> – Players must contend not only with the Yokai but also with an agonizing curse. As the curse gradually consumes you, players may transform into terrifying half-Yokai creatures. Close cooperation between players is essential in overcoming this curse which is not only frightening but also a hindrance to your escape.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Gameplay With Ever-changing Item and Device Locations</strong> – In order to escape, you must perform a ritual to break the seal. However, the items necessary for the ritual are hidden in different locations each time you play. Additionally, you’ll need to search for items that can stall the Yokai or revive fallen teammates, leading to a new experience with every playthrough.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest <i>Kill Team </i>season has started with pace, first with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" rel="nofollow">Hivestorm</a> launch box, then the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set</a>, and now with its first expansion, <em>Kill Team</em> Brutal and Cunning. Brutal and Cunning keeps how expansions worked in the last <em>Kill Team</em> season, with 2 brand new kill teams to play, and a Killzone Upgrade to add into games. In this article, we'll look at what <em>Kill Team</em> Brutal and Cunning contains, what you need to use it, and look in detail at the new kill teams.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>What Does Kill Team Brutal and Cunning Contain?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Brutal and Cunning contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Brutal and Cunning Dossier</li>
	<li>8x Ork Wrecka Krew&nbsp;miniatures (and transfer sheet)</li>
	<li>11x Astra Millitarum Ratling&nbsp;miniatures</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Killzone Upgrade: Compound Siege (14 scenery pieces)</li>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Brutal and Cunning is an expansion pack for <em>Kill Team</em> and while it does contain a lot of content, it's not playable out of the box. If this is your first <em>Kill Team</em> purchase, you will need to pick up another couple of items too. The essential items for playing <em>Kill Team</em> are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em> Core Rulebook</li>
	<li>6-sided dice and a measuring tool</li>
	<li>Scenery&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Starter Set</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Hivestorm</a> are the best places to start, and you can add Brutal and Cunning straight onto those boxes to play with.</p>

<h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Brutal and Cunning, as standard with <em>Kill Team</em> expansions, includes 2 brand new kill teams, the&nbsp;Ork Wrecka Crew kill team and the Astra Millitarum Ratling kill team.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-3.jpg?itok=KGoyoyZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-3.jpg?itok=IUYKnyWB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Ork Wrecka Crew</h4>

<p>Orks love a good scrap, but some find appreciation for more than just fighting, like smashing things up as well, and these like-minded Orks band together, albeit somewhat competitively, under a Boss Nob who knows how to focus them. Wrecka Crews are made up of 2 types of Orks (plus the explosive Bomb Squigs), Tankbustas and Breaka Boyz. The Tankbustas come armed with a choice of Rokkit Launchas or 'Eavy Rokkit Launchas (the only difference is the 'Eavy is slightly more accurate, but has the Heavy keyword). Breaka Boys bring along their Smash Hammers which, along with hitting your enemies with, can also make holes in scenery.</p>

<p>The Wrecka Boys like to build up Wrecka Points, which they get by rolling 6's (and some individual operatives have their own ways to gain points). They can then spend 3 points to retain a fail as a success in later rolls. The Boyz also gain bonus APL if they shoot or fight during their turn, giving them some extra mobility to reposition or complete mission objectives after getting in a scrap.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-4.jpg?itok=o3FPHpU- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-4.jpg?itok=HfkRs5nD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Astra Millitarum Ratling</h4>

<p>The Ratlings are tiny ab-humans (Hobbits of the Warhammer 40K universe), which makes them pretty squishy compared to most of the monstrosities you can face in <em>Kill Team</em>, but it allows them to be super sneaky, and great snipers as a result (and they can take the huge Ogryns in their kill team too, but you'll need to pick them up separately from the Brutal and Cunning set). The basic Ratling operative is a Sniper, who if they remain stationary, has 4 attacks with 2+ to hit, doing an extra 3 damage on each 6 they roll. They also have support operatives like the Spotter, Stashmaster, and Battle Mutt to allow the Snipers to keep shooting. My favorite Ratling is the Big Shot, not only is the miniature incredible, but the Tankstopper rifle punches through armor and flesh alike.</p>

<p>Because you really don't want to get your Ratlings into close combat with an enemy, they have the Scarper special rule, which, after your opponent finishes an activation with an operative, allows you to take a free dash action with a Ratling to get them out of harm's way. Each Ratling can only do this once per turn, and you can't do it after subsequent opposing turns (you need a turn in between each use), but it really helps to keep your operatives safe, or reposition so that you can get a shot in your activation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-5.jpg?itok=JiSmAnm7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-5.jpg?itok=3IUF1CM4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kill Team</em> Killzone Volkus (originally from <em>Kill Team </em>Hivestorm) is now avialable seperately, and the Killzone Upgrade in Brutal and Cunning plugs straight into it.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is The Killzone Upgrade In Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p>A Killzone: Upgrade is an add-on to an existing Killzone. In Brutal and Cunning's case, it's Killzone Upgrade: Compound Siege, an upgrade to Killzone Volkus found in <em>Kill Team</em> Hivestorm (and also now available separately). This new scenery and mission pack adds a fortified base to your games and includes the rules for Player vs Player games, and also solo and cooperatively play vs an AI-controlled opponent, both game types involve players attacking or defending the compound.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p>I absolutely love both Brutal and Cunning kill teams. The Wrecka Crew are a lot of fun and surprisingly tactical (you have to be aggressive, but not too aggressive) and while the Ratling miniatures are awesome, they can be a challenge to pilot, as positioning and your activation order is incredibly important. They are not very forgiving (nor will your opponent be) if you get it wrong. It's a great first expansion for this edition of <em>Kill Team</em>, with 2 wildly different styles of play and some incredible miniatures.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p>If you want either of the kill teams in Brutal and Cunning, this will be the only place to get them before their separate release later on. If you don't want either, the Killzone Upgrade is still decent, and playing Ratlings in the compound against a horde of attacking enemies is a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals was released yesterday, and it wasted no time skyrocketing up the charts with reckless abandon. On Steam, the game managed to secure a whopping peak player count of 444,000 users, marking the game as one of the most successful free-to-play titles on the platform right off the rip.</p>



<p>That performance continued throughout the day, and going into the weekend, player numbers, streaming figures, and the social sentiment around the game continued to grow heading into the weekend.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivalling-blizzard">Marvel Rivalling Blizzard</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is perhaps the most potent Overwatch competitor to ever surface – considering Deadlock isn’t here yet, anyway.</p>



<p>In this superhero-themed title, players are treated to the classic hero shooter elements found in and arguably popularised by Overwatch, but the entire roster is made up of instantly recognisable Marvel heroes. From Iron Man to The Punisher and from Groot to Storm, there’s a veritable plethora of performers for players to assume control of.</p>



<p>I <strong>hate </strong>hero shooters, but I’m pleased to say that, being a Marvel fan, Rivals has me hooked.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky year for live-service shooters, what with the loss of Concord and the impending shutdown of XDefiant, so it’s enriching to see a similar title emerge with such gusto into the gaming space.</p>



<p>The reviews <strong>could be better</strong>, but most of the negative press seems centred around Marvel Rivals not doing enough to distance itself from Overwatch, but that’s kind of the point of the game. It’s an alternative option and a competitor – it’d be tough to replace Overwatch if it wasn’t a lick like the game.</p>



<p>NetEase, the developer behind Marvel Rivals, has already revealed some innovative features that are going to help the game stand out. For instance, just days ago, the team stressed that season-based battle passes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-mechanic-change-monetisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be time-bound</a>, so you’ll be able to unlock missed rewards long after the season has ended.</p>

<p>Myth returned to Twitch recently, with audiences welcoming him back after a lengthy hiatus. It was his first stream on the platform since June 2022, and it saw the popular content creator play Fortnite as OG was ushered back into the game.</p>



<p>His return to the site wasn’t the most successful resurfacing ever, with Myth netting a peak viewer count of just 19,500, prompting many to suggest he’s forever his profile on the platform. He did take the time to reveal why he was away for so long, though – and it’s because he was securing a bag from YouTube, of course.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-bucks">Big Bucks</h2>



<p>Myth confirmed mid-stream that YouTube paid him $4 million for two years of work on the platform. That’s alongside all the paid subscriptions and donations he’d have earned while streaming on the site. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, xQc signed a $100 million deal to stream on Kick.com.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Since 2022, Myth has been exclusive to YouTube, on which he currently boasts a whopping 4.5 million subscribers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many will say that Myth has ‘fallen off’ over the last year. In August, he announced he would be taking a lengthy break from streaming, and it was only yesterday that he resurfaced. In this game, you can become irrelevant <strong>very </strong>quickly, and plenty claim that the pause in producing content left a mark.</p>



<p>Back in February, the streamer was broadcasting to little more than 100 viewers, prompting fans to surmise what could be wrong behind the scenes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/otvandfriendsrumors/comments/1ah5i3r/seeing_myth_stream_to_193_viewers_yesterday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">platforms like Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League 2025 season is finally here. Last night, the first round of matches kicked off, but in typically COD League fashion, the evening was marred by technical issues and shattered expectations. Only one match out of four went as predicted, with some huge upsets being dealt very early on.</p>



<p>This opening night could have set the tone for the tournament ahead, but it’s just bizarre to make a statement like that at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-upset">Big Upset</h2>



<p>The season’s opening match saw the all-new Guerrillas M8 take on Minnesota Rokkr, which also boasted a refreshed roster. It went down to the wire, but Rokkr unexpectedly secured the finish in the eleventh round of the final game of Search.</p>



<p>Thanks to Guerrillas M8’s new roster, bolstered by three world champions, the predictions were in favour of the squad. It was far too close a match for those expectations to be delivered on, though.</p>



<p>That trend continued throughout the evening.</p>



<p>Boston Breach dominated OpTic Texas, the COD League’s reigning champion. That marks four years in a row that OpTic has lost its opening fixture in a new CDL season.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Toronto Ultra decimated Atlanta FaZe, the forever favourite. The only match that went as expected was Vegas Falcons vs. Carolina Royal Ravens. That was a 1 – 3 scoreline in favour of the Ravens, which everyone saw coming a mile off.</p>



<p>Before the evening could commence, the CDL 2025 season had to undergo a few technical issues, which is typical for the League. The first match was 20 minutes late starting, and when it was halfway through the first round of Search, the lobby froze, kicking everyone out.</p>



<p>There are plenty more matches yet to land this weekend, but we could be seeing something of a paradigm shift unfolding this year.</p>

Nintendo DS, 3DS, and Switch follow, and there's even a small section about the Micro vs. System and Pokemon Mini.</p><p>After Nintendo, the book examines the PlayStation Portable, PS Vita, Sega Game Gear, and Neo Geo Pocket Color. Multiple other modern systems are covered besides Switch, including the Analogue Pocket, Evercade, Playdate, and Steam Deck.</p><p>A Handheld History also includes some of the more obscure handhelds and devices from big brands that were overshadowed and ultimately thwarted by Nintendo's handhelds, including Nokia's N-Gage, the Tiger R-Zone, Mega Duck, Atari Lynx, Gamate, and more.</p><p>If you're interested in reading A Handheld History for the Game Boy sections, we'd also recommend two other books specifically about Game Boy. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Boy-Encyclopedia-Released-Nintendo/dp/139909677X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History of the Game Boy by Florent Gorges</a> offers the most comprehensive look at the creation of the Game Boy and the decade of dominance that followed.

			<p>This year has been a horrible one for people in the games industry, as there has been nonstop layoffs across the board. From big companies to indie developers, it doesn't seem like anyone has been spared from it. It's been announced that Deck Nine, the developers behind recently released title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> has laid off more staff. This isn't even the first time this year for Deck Nine, as they experienced layoffs earlier in the year, too.</p>
<p>A statement was shared on the<a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Deck Nine X page</a>, where a statement was made by Mark Lyons, the CEO of the company. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members. This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion, and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.<br>
To those of you leaving the studio to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can.<br>
To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time."</p>
<p>At the moment, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been stated, but it is possible that it's due to the fact that Life is Strange: Double Exposure didn't perform to their expectations, as a lot of people were disappointed with the narrative and especially the ending of the game.</p>
<p>The gaming industry has seen more than 14,600 confirmed jobs lost across 175+ companies in 2024. The most recent layoffs that we saw confirmed were layoffs at Ubisoft that happened earlier in the week, where nearly 300 people have been confirmed to be laid off at the company due to studios within Ubisoft being shut down due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/"> XDefiant officially closing down next year</a>. They are also due to experience more layoffs in February, most likely related to the closure of the studios.</p>
<p>It's not been clarified how many people have been laid off at Deck Nine Games, with their number of staff already being relatively small. In February, they laid off roughly 20% of their staff. Combining that with this new layoff, it's hard to know how many staff members will be left at the company.</p>

<p>Deck Nine Games, the developers of Life is Stange: Double Exposure as well as other Life is Strange games, have announced that it is laying off more staff. It’s the second time this year Deck Nine has held layoffs.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> late Friday afternoon, CEO Mark Lyons said he was “sad to share” the latest developments happening at the Colorado-based studio.</p>







<p>“Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members,” he said. “This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.”</p>



<p>He continued: “To those of you leaving the studio due to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can. To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time.”</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 175+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.

<p>In March, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">showed off its first Genie AI model</a>. After training on thousands of hours of 2D run-and-jump video games, the model could generate halfway-passable, interactive impressions of those games based on generic images or text descriptions.</p>
<p>Nine months later, this week's <a href="https://deep%20mind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">reveal of the Genie 2 model</a> expands that idea into the realm of fully 3D worlds, complete with controllable third- or first-person avatars. Google's announcement talks up Genie 2's role as a "foundational world model" that can create a fully interactive internal representation of a virtual environment. That could allow AI agents to train themselves in synthetic but realistic environments, Google says, forming an important stepping stone on the way to artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>But while Genie 2 shows just how much progress Google's Deepmind team has achieved in the last nine months, the limited public information about the model thus far leaves a lot of questions about how close we are to these foundational model worlds being useful for anything but some short but sweet demos.</p>
<h2>How long is your memory?</h2>
<p>Much like the original 2D Genie model, Genie 2 starts from a single image or text description and then generates subsequent frames of video based on both the previous frames and fresh input from the user (such as a movement direction or "jump"). Google says it trained on a "large-scale video dataset" to achieve this, but it doesn't say just how much training data was necessary compared to the 30,000 hours of footage used to train the first Genie.</p>
<p>Short GIF demos on <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">the Google DeepMind promotional page</a> show Genie 2 being used to animate avatars ranging from wooden puppets to intricate robots to a boat on the water. Simple interactions shown in those GIFs demonstrate those avatars busting balloons, climbing ladders, and shooting exploding barrels without any explicit game engine describing those interactions.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest advance claimed by Google here is Genie 2's "long horizon memory." This feature allows the model to remember parts of the world as they come out of view and then render them accurately as they come back into the frame based on avatar movement. This kind of persistence has proven to be a persistent problem for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">video generation models like Sora</a>, which OpenAI said in February "do[es] not always yield correct changes in object state" and can develop "incoherencies... in long duration samples."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The "long horizon" part of "long horizon memory" is perhaps a little overzealous here, though, as Genie 2 only "maintains a consistent world for up to a minute," with "the majority of examples shown lasting [10 to 20 seconds]." Those are definitely impressive time horizons in the world of AI video consistency, but it's pretty far from what you'd expect from any other real-time game engine. Imagine entering a town in a <em>Skyrim</em>-style RPG, then coming back five minutes later to find that the game engine had forgotten what that town looks like and generated a completely different town from scratch instead.</p>
<h2>What are we prototyping, exactly?</h2>
<p>Perhaps for this reason, Google suggests Genie 2 as it stands is less useful for creating a complete game experience and more to "rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences" or to turn "concept art and drawings... into fully interactive environments."</p>
<p>The ability to transform static "concept art" into lightly interactive "concept videos" could definitely be useful for visual artists brainstorming ideas for new game worlds. However, these kinds of AI-generated samples might be less useful for prototyping actual game <em>designs </em>that go beyond the visual.</p>


<p>On Bluesky, British game designer Sam Barlow (<em>Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</em>, <em>Her Story</em>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrsambarlow.bsky.social/post/3lclhskbxgk2r">points out</a> how game designers often use a process called <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/white-boxing-your-game">whiteboxing</a> to lay out the structure of a game world as simple white boxes well before the artistic vision is set. The idea, he says, is to "prove out and create a gameplay-first version of the game that we can lock so that art can come in and add expensive visuals to the structure. We build in lo-fi because it allows us to focus on these issues and iterate on them cheaply before we are too far gone to correct."</p>
<p>Generating elaborate visual worlds using a model like Genie 2 before designing that underlying structure feels a bit like putting the cart before the horse. The process almost seems designed to generate generic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip">"asset flip"-style</a> worlds with AI-generated visuals papered over generic interactions and architecture.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As podcaster Ryan Zhao <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insrtcoins.bsky.social/post/3lcl6epzwm22k">put it on Bluesky</a>, "The design process has gone wrong when what you need to prototype is 'what if there was a space.'"</p>

<h2>Gotta go fast</h2>
<p>When Google revealed the first version of Genie earlier this year, it also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15391v1">released a detailed research paper</a> outlining the specific steps taken behind the scenes to train the model and how that model generated interactive videos. They haven't done the same for a research paper detailing Genie 2's process, leaving us guessing at some important details.</p>
<p>One of the most important of these details is model speed. The first Genie model generated its world at roughly one frame per second, a rate that was orders of magnitude slower than would be tolerably playable in real time. For Genie 2, Google only says that "the samples in this blog post are generated by an undistilled base model, to show what is possible. We can play a distilled version in real-time with a reduction in quality of the outputs."</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, it sounds like the full version of Genie 2 operates at something well below the real-time interactions implied by those flashy GIFs. It's unclear how much "reduction in quality" is necessary to get a diluted version of the model to real-time controls, but given the lack of examples presented by Google, we have to assume that reduction is significant.</p>

<p>Real-time, interactive AI video generation isn't exactly a pipe dream. Earlier this year, AI model maker <a href="https://www.decart.ai/">Decart</a> and hardware maker <a href="https://www.etched.com/">Etched</a> published <a href="https://oasis-model.github.io/">the Oasis model</a>, showing off a human-controllable, AI-generated video clone of <em>Minecraft</em> that runs at a full 20 frames per second. However, that 500 million parameter model was trained on millions of hours of footage of a single, relatively simple game, and focused exclusively on the limited set of actions and environmental designs inherent to that game.</p>
<p>When Oasis launched, its creators fully admitted the model "struggles with domain generalization," showing how "realistic" starting scenes <a href="https://oasis-model.github.io/colloseum.webp">had to be reduced to simplistic <em>Minecraft</em> blocks</a> to achieve good results. And even with those limitations, it's not hard to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/11/03/minecraft-is-finally-haunted-thanks-to-generative-ai/">find footage</a> of Oasis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWh4u2sXBhU">degenerating into horrifying nightmare fuel</a> after just a few minutes of play.</p>

<p>We can already see similar signs of degeneration in the extremely short GIFs shared by the Genie team, such as an avatar's <a href="https://deepmind.google/api/blob/website/media/long_video_1.mp4">dream-like fuzz</a> during high-speed movement or NPCs that <a href="https://deepmind.google/api/blob/website/media/npc_1.mp4">quickly fade into undifferentiated blobs</a> at a short distance. That's not a great sign for a model whose "long memory horizon" is supposed to be a key feature.</p>

<p>Genie 2 seems to be using individual game frames as the basis for the animations in its model. But it also seems able to infer some basic information about the objects in those frames and craft interactions with those objects in the way a game engine might.</p>
<p>Google's blog post shows how <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/">a SIMA agent</a> inserted into a Genie 2 scene can follow simple instructions like "enter the red door" or "enter the blue door," controlling the avatar via simple keyboard and mouse inputs. That could potentially make Genie 2 environment a great test bed for AI agents in various synthetic worlds.</p>
<p>Google claims rather grandiosely that Genie 2 puts it on "the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards [artificial general intelligence]." Whether or not that ends up being true, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05741">recent research</a> shows that agent learning gained from foundational models can be effectively applied to real-world robotics.</p>
<p>Using this kind of AI model to create worlds for other AI models to learn in might be the ultimate use case for this kind of technology. But when it comes to the dream of an AI model that can create generic 3D worlds that a human player could explore in real time, we might not be as close as it seems.</p>

            <p>
If you'd been hoping to round out your 2024 with a solid blast of 90s nostalgia, there's some bad news; Argonaut Games' Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster - previously scheduled to release this month - has been delayed into "Q1" next year.
</p>
<p>
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos initially launched for PlayStation 1 some 27 years ago, taking players - in the role of the titular reptile - on a platforming adventure through Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante.
</p>
<p>
Argonaut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-is-being-remastered-by-resurrected-argonaut-games">announced it was resurrecting its beloved 1997 3D platformer back in August</a> - news that was doubly surprisingly given that Argonaut itself hadn't existed since it closed amid financial troubles in 2004. However, the studio has now risen from the ashes of the past as a "boutique publisher" under the watch of new co-CEOs Gary Sheinwald and Mike Arkin.

<p>
The revived company's Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster was originally due to launch for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via GOG) this month, but Argonaut has now pushed its release back into early 2025 in order to "add the final touches to ensure the game meets the high standards that we aspire to and which you deserve."
</p><p>
"We understand that after 27 years of waiting, this news might be a little disappointing," it continued, "especially with the festive season coming soon. However, our goal has always been to deliver a game with the quality and polish that will truly delight. We appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring Croc back in the best possible way."
</p>
<p>
Argonaut's Croc: Legend of the Gobbos spruce-up promises enhanced high-definition graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and a "nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience". It'll also include the Crocipedia, a "curated digital museum" incorporating the likes of game design documents, concept art, animation tests, and team member interviews.
</p>
<p>
When Croc: Legend of the Gobbos eventually shows up next year, its digital edition - available on all platforms - will cost $29.99 USD, while a PS5 and Switch physical edition is priced at $39.99. But if you're absolutely wild with nostalgia, a $129.99 Collector's Edition is also available, packing in the remaster, a full-colour manual, a four-disc soundtrack featuring over 100 tunes, a key chain, sticker sheet, poster, premium box, and eight-inch resin Croc statue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If I told you that Valve could make a play to dethrone the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox in your living room this next year while simultaneously challenging the Meta Quest as the gamer’s VR headset of choice, would you believe me? Because Valve may have a <em>lot</em> of SteamOS hardware on the way.</p><div><p>If there’s fire where we currently see smoke, Valve is currently preparing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">wireless VR headset codename Deckard</a>, a pair <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">of trackable wands codename Roy</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">a Steam Controller 2 gamepad codename Ibex</a>, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314279/what-could-valve-possibly-be-cooking-with-amd-chromeos-and-hdmi-cec">codename Fremont living room console</a> too. (That last one <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1864960200924450934">now looks likelier</a> than it did yesterday.) And Valve has also now seemingly revealed plans for partners to create third-party SteamOS hardware too.</p></div><p>It won’t be easy to take on Sony, Microsoft, or Meta. Those companies have a lot to lose, and they’re deeply entrenched. But the Steam Deck has revealed a massive weakness in each of their businesses that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">may take</a> them <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">years to correct</a> — the desire to play a huge library of games anytime, anywhere. </p><p>And while they figure <em>that</em> out, Valve may be building an entire new ecosystem of SteamOS hardware, one that could finally let PC and peripheral makers tap into the huge and growing library of Windows games on all sorts of different hardware without relying on Microsoft or subjecting their customers to the many annoyances of Windows.  </p><p>Today, every major PC company is building <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">one or more Steam Deck rivals</a>. But without Valve’s blessing and support, they’re saddled with a Windows OS that doesn’t start, pause, and resume games quickly and seamlessly enough to feel portable and easy. When building those handhelds, they typically rely on off-the-shelf AMD chips, too, since no other manufacturer’s parts currently compete on Windows gaming plus battery. </p><p>But Valve has long said it will open up SteamOS to other manufacturers, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">recently committing to some direct support for rival handhelds</a> like the Asus ROG Ally — and the other week, Valve quietly updated <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">a document</a> that may reveal its larger overarching strategy. It won’t just leave SteamOS sitting around and hope manufacturers build something — it’ll hold their hand.</p><div><figcaption><em>Valve’s new branding guidelines include “Powered by SteamOS” hardware.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Vale</cite></p></div><p>Valve now has an explicit label for third parties to create “Powered by SteamOS” devices, which it explicitly defines as “hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.” </p><p>It additionally lets companies create “Steam Compatible” hardware that ships with “Valve approved controller inputs,” as well as SteamVR hardware and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22962051/steam-games-remote-play-windows-ios-android-macos-streaming">Steam Link</a> hardware that lets you stream games from one device to another. </p><p>And if the leaks are correct, manufacturers may not have to pick just one or two of those labels. <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1861563064836915429">It sounds like</a> Valve’s Steam Controller 2 may contain the ingredients to be recognized and tracked in a VR environment and that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">Valve’s VR wands</a> will feature enough buttons to double as a gamepad, playing Steam’s massive library of flatscreen games as well. </p><p>Valve may be putting in the work to reduce dependence on AMD’s x86 chips as well. Datamining by Brad Lynch, the Valve watcher whose community has uncovered most if not all of these leaks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24250135/is-valve-cooking-up-an-arm-powered-vr-headset">showed that Valve has been testing many Steam games</a>, including VR games, on Arm chips as well. </p><p>While Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview?ref=uploadvr.com#:~:text=the%20Steam%20Deck%E2%80%99s%20custom%20APU%20in%20a%20standalone%20VR%20headset">once told me</a> that the Steam Deck’s AMD x86 chip might be a good candidate for a possible future standalone VR headset, Arm chips could potentially offer better battery life and lower weight for a portable product than x86 — even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314279/what-could-valve-possibly-be-cooking-with-amd-chromeos-and-hdmi-cec">while Valve investigates more powerful AMD solutions than ever</a> for a possible living room console.</p><p>When Valve asked PC manufacturers to sign onto its Steam Machines initiative over a decade ago, with the idea of building living room PC consoles, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">it asked for a leap of faith with very little to show and a tiny chance of success</a>. It took years for Valve to even build the oddball living room controller for its Steam Machines, and it didn’t get far in convincing Windows game developers to port their games to Linux. </p><p>But by the time it announced the Steam Deck, Valve had hammered out a Proton software compatibility layer so good that many Windows games now run <em>better</em> on Linux, and created the most customizable yet familiar set of controls ever made.</p><p>If manufacturers could build their own Steam Machines rather than equivalent Windows machines, they could offer better gaming products than they do today. Maybe they’d even want to release a VR headset that isn’t tied to Microsoft or Meta if it doubled as a Steam Deck, portably playing decades of flatscreen games.</p><p>It’s not clear any of this will pan out; Valve is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">an exceedingly small company</a> that tries not to chase too many things at a time. When I speak to PC industry executives about why they pick Windows over SteamOS, some say they’re concerned about whether Valve would truly be able to support them. </p><div><p>But it’s just as intriguing an idea <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console">as it was 12 years ago</a> when Gabe Newell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">explained the initial vision to us</a>, and this time, there’s a far better chance it’ll work.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/foamstars-final-season-update-drops-on-december-13th.1054476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/https-www-thesixthaxis-com-wp-content-uploads-2024-01-foamstars-hero500-jpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It looks like Square Enix are winding down support for Foamstars, their cartoony foam brawler.&nbsp; Someone at Square seems to have an ironic sense of humour as the final season is called “Party Goes On!”.</p>
<p>“In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customize shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future,” say Square Enix.</p>


<p>“All online services will remain available after the “PARTY GOES ON!” season ends. In addition, we plan to hold the FOAMSTARS CUP, a series of in-game events named after each character.<br>
Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy FOAMSTARS, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Foamstars - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jla2yb3VbGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PS5 exclusive game went free to play in October this year but that doesn’t seem to have helped boost the popularity of the game.</p>

<p>Launched in February as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly game and PS4 and PS5 exclusive, before transitioning to being a moderately priced premium game in March. However, it seems that this hasn’t given the game a large enough community, pushing Square Enix to shift business models. An additional benefit of this change is that, as a free-to-play game, Foamstars will no longer require a PS Plus subscription in order to play online.</p>
<p>Foamstars was quickly pegged as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon</a> copycat by gamers, but introduced some quirky ideas alongside, such as being able to build up the foam into 3D structures, instead of just blanketing the level in your team’s colour.</p>
<p>Looking back at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/12/foamstars-review-ps4-ps5-ps-plus/">Foamstars review</a>, Jim said, “Foamstars is a vibrantly inventive take on the hero shooter and Splatoon, though the bubble will quickly burst for those who can’t gel with its floaty, fluid-based gunplay.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preserving-video-game-history-is-an-uphill-battle.1054449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-video-game-history-foundation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unless there’s imminently mineable gold in the hills of a remaster or re-release, the video game industry rarely displays interest in its own history. Last year, the Video Game History Foundation <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a study</a> showing that 87 percent of classic video games released in the US verge on inaccessible. That makes the archival work done by the VGHF all the more important, but the road to long-term preservation is full of potholes. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk to VGHF founder and director Frank Cifaldi about what those look like and <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can help</a>.</p><p>In an uncommon twist, Frank joins us near the end of the episode, because he had multiple other podcasts to be on the day we recorded (he’s very important). We discuss the unique needs of a video game archive – for example, remote access to games, something the US Copyright Office recently <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused to grant</a> after a three-year effort on the part of the VGHF and the Software Preservation Network – and what the Foundation has been able to accomplish this year despite a government and industry that often fail to recognize the importance of its work.&nbsp;</p><p>Also on this episode: We (minus Frank) talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s decision to pull the plug on <em>XDefiant</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-future-chatgpt-pc-gamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI’s increasingly money-hungry forays</a> into <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscriptions</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/ads-might-be-coming-to-chatgpt-despite-sam-altman-not-being-a-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe ads</a>), and our various hyperfixations in <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Candy Cabs</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>. Oh, and speaking of hyperfixations, Chris says that New Year's resolutions are just an amateur hour version of a real project, so take that, me and everybody else.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can help preserve video game history via a format accessible to and beloved by all: blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> As we reach the end of the year and people are reflecting on what they’ve done – and especially going into <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your funding drive</a> – what has the Video Game History Foundation accomplished this year? What have been your focuses, and what have you managed to achieve?</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> This year has been a lot of building for the future internally, so not very interesting at the outset things. But the actual labor on this <a href="https://gamehistory.org/introducing-the-vghf-digital-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital library</a>, the actual building of the tools that do correct character recognition for magazines [has been a focus]. That one’s OCRAP, right Phil? What’s that stand for?</p><p><strong>VGHF library director Phil Salvador [off screen]:</strong> Optical Character Recognition For Archival Purposes.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s so good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> It talks to another tool called BUBSY. Something you overhear pretty often here are phrases like “Should we give BUBSY admin access?” and it’s an actual, real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Building those tools out for our library launch has been a lot of our focus. But beyond that, I think the biggest public-facing thing is that we testified in front of the Copyright Office to try to lift copyright restrictions for libraries and archives to provide remote access to video games, which is something that is not legal to do in any scenario unless you have explicit copyright permission from the copyright holder. That didn’t end up going through. I don’t know if I want to rant publicly about my real thoughts about what went down there, but that’s kind of building off some other work we’ve done to raise awareness of preservation issues.</p><p>A lot of people saw a study we put out last year which was able to demonstrate that nine out of ten classic games are out of print. You can’t buy them. That’s something that I think any one of us here kind of inherently knew, but that the industry wasn’t acknowledging. The last time we tried to get a copyright exemption, [rightsholder groups] were able to successfully argue to the Copyright Office that the industry does a great job of keeping its history in print. So that’s why we did this study to be like “No, you don’t.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What did [the Entertainment Software Association and others associated with rightsholders] <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argue this time</a>? Now that the study is out there, how did they once again say “No, everything is fine”?</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>The argument basically comes down to “We believe there will be market harm if people can play video games remotely through a library.” That people will stop buying video games because they can play some games for free.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s a pretty insane argument, but OK.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The MS-DOS version of <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em> must be protected.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Otherwise I won’t buy the 18th <em>Skyrim </em>re-release.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> Right, if they can play <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em>, they’re not gonna buy <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Simple as that!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I was wondering about this in relation to other recent developments: I’m sure you saw that GOG is having to delist the <em>Warcraft </em>games because Blizzard put out their own remasters, but GOG said they’re still going to continue to update them to run on modern hardware [as part of <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/the-gog-preservation-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Preservation Program</a>]. GOG is a store. Their number one goal is not to preserve history; it’s to make money. But do you think efforts like that still matter? Are they still important in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>I’ve been saying for a long time that there are many forms of preservation, and some of them can be commercial. I think there’s a cultural preservation element to re-releasing games, for example. That is a form of cultural preservation: keeping franchises in the public eye.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think you meant to be reductive, but GOG has a commercial interest, of course, but it’s coming from a place of caring.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh yeah, they obviously care a lot.</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>That said, this is the job of an archive. I would never trust a commercial entity for permanent preservation – or at least an attempt at permanent preservation. I’m really glad they’re doing it. It is a temporary solution for a real problem. I don’t believe that GOG lasts forever, whereas I think a well-funded archive might. And I’m not even necessarily saying ours; we’re not that well-funded yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But the point is, that is the job of a library and an archivist historically. Kind of going back to even the [ESA] thing – how the availability of old stuff for free would hurt the current market – I think we live in a world where if a library was a new idea, everyone would laugh it off.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh, definitely. They’d be like “That’s socialism!”</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> Right, exactly. So it doesn’t surprise me that it’s a tremendous uphill battle to modernize the concept of a library. It makes a lot of sense to me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nadia-removed-from-delta-force-streamer-event-following-%E2%80%98cheater%E2%80%99-investigation.1054437/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nadia Amine, a streamer with a fairly bad reputation, was booted from a Delta Force ‘streamer showdown’ following an investigation into some allegations made against her. </p>



<p>On social media, Team Jade announced that Nadia would be one of many streamers invited to take part in a special event. When users started mentioning her ‘history’ with cheats – most notably in Call of Duty: Warzone – Team Jade said it would ‘investigate further’…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-booted">Booted</h2>



<p>Team Jade ultimately removed Nadia from the Delta Force streamer event. The team scrubbed her from the line-up of content creators without so much as a single word on social media. This came after Team Jade posted a reply to the allegations of past cheating:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to our community for bringing this matter to our attnetion – we are now investigating further.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1865148372459647135/photo/2">Jake Lucky on Twitter</a> for the receipts</em></p>



<p>Team Jade has since deleted that post – but nothing can truly disappear from the internet, right?</p>



<p>By way of a response, Nadia launched into a rant against Team Jade, and she too came with her own receipts on the post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These guys are so unprofessional. They made a tweet about investigating me, their talent, becuase people believe everything they see and spread lies about me. They deleted their tweet, I asked for a public apology, they told me to wait and are checking with the publisher.</p>



<p>I told them I’m going to go public with me leaving, and then they told me again to wait so they can ‘coordinate with their team’. But then, they go public with me not being a talent anymore first, which then makes me look guilty.</p>



<p>After they are the ones who told me to hold off on going public. What kind of f***ing business is this?!!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nadia has admittedly flip-flopped on the cheating bit for the longest time. She rose to notoriety on Call of Duty: Warzone while riding that wave, and even went as far as to make tongue-in-cheek references to being a cheater on social media and streams.</p>



<p>Ultimately, nothing has been definitively proven, even if sleuth gamers have taken to TikTok and other video-sharing platforms to reveal frame-by-frame playbacks of Nadia’s clips.</p>
