            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has shared a few thoughts about modding ahead of The Last of Us Part 2's PC debut.</p>
<p>As we all know, PC gamers love a mod or two. Often within moments of a PC release, we are soon being met with the likes of Shrek and Thomas the Tank Engine taking centre stage, be it in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baby-chris-lady-x-and-dante-lead-the-early-days-of-resident-evil-village-modding">horror flavoured series like Resident Evil</a> or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-thomas-the-tank-engine-starfield-mod-gave-me-quite-a-freight">space bound Starfield</a>.</p>
<p>But, what do developers think of mods in their games? Well, in the case of The Last of Us Part 2 Remaster’s game director Matthew Gallant, he is all for them and appreciates mods can make an experience more "comfortable" for players. Additionally, he understands that with games, unlike with films or books, "there's kind of like a gradient of authorship within the medium".</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/04/01/naughty-dog-and-nixxes-on-the-pc-port-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii-we-take-the">GameInformer</a>, Gallant said The Last of Us Part 2's PC release will open up "the game in a way that wasn't previously possible".  He added it will be "an interesting journey to see what players do with the game now that it's kind of on this very, open-ended ecosystem" which means Naughty Dog will have "a lot less control" over it.</p>
<p>"But I feel like, in general, where we're at is wanting to meet players where they are. We’re interested to see what players modify in the game. And, I think, [Naughty Dog head of techTravis McIntosh] said this in an earlier interview - sometimes that's a clue to us to say, 'Oh, we should have thought of that. Oh, that's an interesting option,' that sort of thing," Gallant said.</p>
<p>"But that's maybe the kind of the balance between, like, 'Yes, we're very, concerned about creating a player experience'. You coming along with a story. And we really want to tell you that story in the best way possible. But we're okay if telling that story in the best way possible means you're tweaking a bunch of things to make it the right experience for you."</p>
<p>The developer said simply, if players need to make some changes that allow them "to have a good, comfortable time", then the team supports them.</p>
<p>When further asked if this frame of mind would still apply if players decided to turn The Last of Us Part 2's Ellie into Shrek, Gallant said the team just enjoys seeing the community engage with titles "in whatever way that expresses themselves in terms of funny edits or whatever is going to open up this game on PC". So, if that means Shrek Ellie, I guess that means Shrek Ellie.</p>
<p>"I think part of what's interesting with games as a medium is that we actually don't have total complete authorship in the way that someone writing a book or directing a movie – there's kind of like a gradient of authorship within the medium," the game director explained.</p>
<p>"Games are pretty extreme, where the player [brings] a lot of themselves to the experience and how they play and the experience they have where they choose to go, completes the story that's told through the medium of video games. I'm maybe stretching the metaphor a little bit here, but that's kind of where my head goes to people taking any of our games and appreciating it or engaging with it in some way that maybe to us is strange, or to us is, maybe we wouldn't want to do that… We're just thrilled the players love these games or want to engage with them at the end of the day."</p>

			<p>505 Games included Wccftech in a second PC preview behind closed doors at 2025's Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, CA, where we <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with Blades of Fire</a> from MercurySteam and also a new Soulslike from developer Leenzee, a Chinese development studio whose work I was only familiar with previously with the VR-exclusive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1523370/AD_2047/">A.D. 2047</a>. Their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, brings the Ming Dynasty into a soulslike with a title that you wouldn't be alone in confusing with other W-named action RPGs of recent years.</p>
<p>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, but I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers opened with two save files to play with. One was a typical level section, while the second was touted as a more challenging boss fight. Feeling confident of my skills with Lies of P, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin">Stranger of Paradise</a>, and other Masocore/Soulslike RPGs, I skipped to just opt for the second file. This gave me a loadout of a few different weapons and armor sets and a very small slice of exploration leading into the main boss arena while there was a second closed off music hall that led to a miniboss. Both of these were more humanoid, especially the main boss of this hands-on demo, but I would expect more demonic entities to pop up later on in Wuchang's story.</p>
<p>One of the core mechanics that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on in the combat that wasn't fully explained to me was the Skyborn Might combo system, where resources are built up in regular combat and unleashed for spells and skills unique to each weapon type (there is a system to slot in specific skills into your weapons and not all of them seemed to carry over between types). While the dual gunswords called to me, it was ultimately Wuchang's whip sword with a simple parry ability that would help negate most of the attacks coming my way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was so focused on parrying and dodging attacks that I routinely succumbed to the main boss Honglan's attacks shortly after knocking her health bar down halfway and going into her second phase. Without using more of the Skyborn Might to unleash stronger attacks, the fights were largely battles of attrition where my defensiveness was coupled with a small amount of chipping the enemy health down little by little. I quickly learned the hard way that martial moves, such as kicks and grabs, aren't able to be blocked or parried and instead must be evaded in some way.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I've seen more of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers in my gameplay session, but I was quickly filtered by Honglan's merciless attacks, and my hubris wouldn't let me give up, and try the more relaxing exploration demo instead. Soon enough, I'll have my revenge and get a firmer grasp of the mechanics to hopefully make quick work of Honglan and the rest of the bosses in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers when it launches later this year.</p>
<p>While no specific date has been given by 505 Games or Leenzee at this time, there's a tentative Summer 2025 release window for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC (Steam, GOG, Epic Game Store, and Windows).</p>

            <p>A video game union representing around 300 workers at Elder Scrolls, Doom and Fallout publisher ZeniMax Media have overwhelmingly voted for strike action if they’re unable to thrash out a deal over wages and workplace conditions with Microsoft, ZeniMax’s parent company. The unionised workers and Microsoft have been haggling over things like remote work options and outsourcing game testing for nearly two years; now, they say they’re prepared to down tools if their concerns aren’t addressed.</p>
<p>QA workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">founded ZeniMax Workers United in December 2023</a>, as part of the umbrella organisation of the Communication Workers Of America (CWA) union. Microsoft acknowledged the union at the time, but as Brendy pointed out in a previous write-up, this likely isn’t an indication of union sympathies among the leadership. Microsoft had previously signed a “neutrality” deal with the CWA in order to grease the wheels of their Activision-Blizzard acquisition, allowing workers to "freely and fairly make a choice about union representation”.</p>
<p>Last year, the ZWU participated in a one-day strike claiming that Microsoft did not adequately address employee concerns over their return to office policies and outsourcing practices. According to a statement released yesterday, their members “are continuing to take a stand at the table over better wages, workplace improvements, and key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company’s replacement of in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union.” They’ve now voted by more than 94% to approve their leaders to kick off a strike if Microsoft don’t give them a contract addressing these things.</p>
<p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong comments in the statement. “None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.”</p>
<p>Associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield adds: “Despite being one of the world’s largest corporations, we’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we’re asking for too much. Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of union action at Microsoft-owned companies lately. 241 Bethesda Game Studios workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">started a CWA-affiliated union</a> of their own last summer. 461 ZeniMax Online Studios staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">followed suit in December</a>. Pay and working conditions aside, many of these workers are worried about job security and the effects of generative AI tools upon their livelihoods. Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">have sunk billions into genAI development</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">laying off thousands of people</a> in the course of their Activision-Blizzard acquisition.</p>
<p>Nic has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">taking the lead</a> on our union reporting.

<p>Schedule 1 attracted several hundred thousand players in its first week alone. The developer has outlined a consistent line of plans and future content updates for Schedule 1 through a detailed roadmap.</p>



<p>If you took one look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> as an outsider, you’d think it was a South Park-inspired game about drugs. The art style could sway this argument, but Schedule 1 is big and beastly enough to cement its own identity and status as one of 2025’s biggest indie titles. </p>



<p>Developer TVGS is releasing a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patches</a> to keep the experience smooth and steady. But Schedule 1’s future is looking very bright, and we’ve looked at what we’ve all got to look forward to.</p>

<h2 id="h-schedule-1-roadmap-explained">Schedule 1 Roadmap Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The official Schedule 1 Trello board has an extensive list of “Monthly Update Ideas and “Smaller Additions/Improvements.” These are listed under the “Schedule 1 Roadmap,” and each list features an assortment of new activities, gameplay ideas, mechanics, and quality-of-life ideas.</strong></p>



<p>An “In Progress” column also exists. As of writing, this is empty, so we presume TVGS is focusing on either taking some downtime to recover from the overwhelming start, hasn’t updated the <a href="https://trello.com/b/VQQpru3F/schedule-i-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Trello</a> yet, or is getting ready to work on a new update.</p>



<p>We’ll keep checking in to see what new ideas are floating around for Schedule 1.</p>

But the one the people behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> came up may perhaps live a little longer in the memory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment declared that the new Chaplain class would be released as DLC on April 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In story mode, swap out Titus for The Chaplain and experience the game as a true Codex-compliant Ultramarine,” Focus said, no doubt sniggering from behind their monitors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ‘DLC’ supposedly added the new playable character to the story mode, as well as an ‘Enhanced Dialogue System’ that would have the Chaplain, every five minutes, remind everyone around him that “the Codex Astartes does not support this action,” and “I’m telling the Inquisition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chaplain even has a special ability called Discipline. This would involve instantly reporting “any and all minor deviations from the Codex Astartes for a 5% discipline bonus (but -20% brotherhood bonus).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/gndip2wxsaacl76-1743582241376.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The joke here works because as anyone who played Space Marine 2’s campaign knows, Chaplain Quintus watches Titus’ every move with a hawk-like distrust for signs of heresy, despite the protagonist’s demonstrable loyalty to the Imperium, the Ultramarines, and the Emperor himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the campaign, as Titus battles against the Tyranids and the Thousand Sons traitor legion, it becomes clear there is something… special about him, and Chaplain Quintus does not like that one bit. He’s a bit like the annoying school prefect who patrols the corridors for a mere whiff of deviant behavior and then— bam! You’re reported to the headmaster. Everyone hates the Chaplain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chaplain has become something of a meme within the Space Marine community, and it’s this status that the Space Marine 2 April Fool’s joke leans into. But some fans have said they would love for The Chaplain to actually come to the game, not, perhaps, with this exact skill set, but as a straight-up warrior-priest who insists upon the veneration of the Emperor at all times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This would actually go hard if this was real,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1jp0r9r/this_would_actually_go_hard_if_this_was_real/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared ResidentDrama9739 in a post on the Space Marine subreddit</a> that’s full of enthusiastic chatter about the Chaplain and how he might work in the game. Some are even saying </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-moves-to-set-the-record-straight-insists-its-not-abandoning-the-game-following-space-marine-3-announcement">Space Marine 2 <em>is </em>getting a new class soon</a>. Focus and developer Saber Interactive have yet to say what it is, but fans certainly have their theories. Most assume it will be the Apothecary, as close to a medic class as Space Marines have. But there is hope that it could be the Librarian, which would mean super cool warp-powered space magic. Does the Chaplain’s star turn in Space Marine 2’s April Fool’s Day joke rule him out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</a>. Space Marine 2’s year one roadmap remains, and Patch 7 is set to be released mid-April. But in the coming months Space Marine 2 will also get the aforementioned new class as well as new PvE operations and melee weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-praises-sony-for-their-creative-freedom-was-inspired-by-no-mans-skys-comeback/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Helldivers 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most successful games launched in 2024</a>, but it also experienced multiple ups and downs throughout the year following controversies such as the one related to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-will-soon-require-a-psn-account-even-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation account linking on PC</a>.</p>
<p>Shams Jorjani, who joined Arrowhead as the new CEO a few months after the game's release, was featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwfeihYDY18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an episode of The Game Business show</a> to discuss this remarkable experience. Among various topics, Jorjani said he was impressed with Sony allowing Arrowhead to retain creative control of Helldivers 2 despite the fact that the PlayStation company had funded the whole thing.</p>
<p><em>The other big surprising thing, and this is maybe going to paint me in bad colors, is I came into this thinking that the relationship with PlayStation would be quite different. Now, I have 12 years working at Paradox as a publisher. I assumed Sony, having paid a lot of money for this project, would exert a whole lot more control and run the show more or less, because what do these wild kids here in Sweden know? But I've been very pleasantly surprised to see how creator-friendly PlayStation has been as a studio. Truly, truly impressive. There have been fumbles, of course. Any company does, but they've been an amazing partner throughout and I think that they have a bit too much flack from the Helldivers 2 community at times. Helldivers would not exist if PlayStation was not so focused on creating cool stuff for players, and I'm not blowing smoke up their ass. They've been a genuinely good partner in this.</em></p>
<p>Helldivers 2 also nosedived all the way down to just 19% user score on Steam at one point. However, the team steadily climbed back up, and Jorjani said he was inspired by No Man's Sky's comeback.</p>
<p><em>During the Summer, when everyone was away, our user score was down to 19% and I had to get on a call with Herman Hulst (CEO of PlayStation Studios) to explain why things were in the state they were and what we were doing to recover. I had to say the awkward truth, that there was nothing we could do in the immediate short term to resolve this, but in the long term we had plans that would get us back on track. We issued a 60-day plan that put us back on the track and we did an update and an update and an update. I was very much inspired by No Man's Sky and the team over there that had a similar journey: very hyped, then bombed, and then they put their head to the grindstone and just updated the game. I want to say that since September, we've been on a very good trajectory. We've been just penduluming between it's so over and we're so back, and it's become a meme within the community. We went from 19% to 94% positive on Steam.</em></p>

<p>Elsewhere in the conversation, Jorjani attributed much of the success of Helldivers 2 to the Game Master feature that keeps the game fresh and engaging over time. Just a couple of weeks ago, the planet Moradesh was blown up partly because of the choices made by players when engaging in the galactic war. The current Premium Warbond (the game's equivalent of a Battle Pass) is the Wild West-themed Borderline Justice, featuring the R-6 Deadeye lever-action hunting rifle and the energy-based LAS-58 Talon “revolver”.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Schedule 1 on PlayStation or Xbox? Console Status Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained.1151811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam has been flooded by players desperate to play Schedule 1—a sleeper breakthrough. It’s shot to popularity on PC, but we’re here to see if you can play it on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>It’s amazing what the power of the grapevine and word of mouth can do. 2025’s indie sensation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> for the longest time, but in the blink of an eye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> kindly asked it to move over. Your meteoric ascendancy to head of Hyland Point is fueled by drugs, and the unique gameplay has turned more than a few heads.</p>



<p>Its player count has dominated the top of Steam Charts for a while, so let’s see if PlayStation and Xbox users can get in on the deal.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-schedule-1-on-ps5">Can You Play Schedule 1 on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t sus. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As per the Schedule 1 Discord, you can’t play the crime simulator on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 as it stands.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1256767987873091664/1267444919295803544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Discord</a> is home to all answers and questions about the game. But one that pops up frequently is if the title is lining up a PS4 or PS5 experience anytime soon.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the answer is a definite no for now. This might change in the future, though, depending on the success of the indie title—although if it carries on this way it won’t be “indie” for much longer!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-schedule-1-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Schedule 1 on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s also bad news for Microsoft fans as Schedule 1 isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s head back to the Schedule 1 Discord for a second. An official question is posed asking: “Will it (Schedule I) be available on Xbox/Playstation?” The developer has answered this: “<strong>Unfortunately not on release, but potentially in the future, depending on how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.</strong>“</p>



<p>I’m not entirely sure what they mean by “how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.” This might relate to the nature of the content and not allowing it on the PS or Xbox Store, but I feel this is unlikely, as we’ve seen worse. Regardless, like any indie hit on Steam, the initial buzz for Schedule 1 is outrageous, and it’s a huge success.</p>



<p>If the game can buck the trend of seeing its initial popularity disappear and become a long-standing hit in the vein of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-animated-series-trailer-revealed-during-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us</a>, it would be <em>dope </em>to see it on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later on.</p>



<hr>



<p>Converse with fellow Schedule 1 players in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Official Forum</a>. You can talk about the new title, whether you think it can keep its success going, and ask for specific guides for the game.</p>

            <p>Today's the day. This afternoon, Nintendo will air a Switch 2 dedicated Direct broadcast from which we expect a release date and price for the new console, as well as a look at some of its upcoming games. And as ever, we'll be watching, reporting and reacting to the broadcast live, as it happens, right here.</p>
<p>Set your Alarmo clocks for 2pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am EDT / 6am PDT. The show is expected to be an hour long.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo, remember, has already unveiled the form factor of Switch 2</a>, which surprise surprise, looks a lot like the existing Switch, only bigger. Lurking within, though, are significant changes, such as Joy-Con that magnetically snap to the side of the machine, USB-C ports, a mysterious C button, rumoured mouse-like Joy-Con functionality, and, of course, more powerful innards. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2s-reveal-what-have-we-learned-about-its-performance-potential">as Digital Foundry noted, while forensically picking over the Switch 2 details</a>, we're still not sure exactly how powerful it is. Questions remain. Will they be answered today?</p>
<p>The previous reveal also gave us a glimpse of a new Mario Kart game, which notably teased the possibility of 24-player races. Will we see more of that game today? And what of Nintendo's other first-party games for Switch 2 - are there any, and if there are, which ones will they be? Big, legacy franchises, or smaller things? I also wonder what kind of third-party support Nintendo has attracted for Switch 2.</p>
<p>But the biggest questions are of course price and release date. How soon will the console come out? There's a widely held belief Switch 2 is imminent, though the console's public hands-on tour runs until June. Is that when it will finally arrive? And how much will it cost? There's talk of a $400 price point, which puts it $100 above what Switch 1 launched at, and talk of $70 games. But will these figures be born out?</p>
<p>There's lots to discover, and we'll be building up to the reveal throughout the day here. Excited?</p><figure>

      <p>Wow moment</p>
    <p>The only game we can more or less guarantee seeing at the Switch 2 Direct later today is the new Mario Kart, but is that likely to wow people? It's possible, Mario Kart 8 looked great, but I'd be surprised if it turned heads like Breath of the Wild did. So, if there is to be a wow moment, what game will cause it?</p>
<p>An impressive port of a current-gen game would do wonders to sell people on what the Switch 2 is capable of, but would Cyberpunk 2077 make you spill your coffee? Would Assassin's Creed Shadows cause you to spit tea all over your monitor (hopefully not if you're at work)? What game would surprise and delight you if it appeared during the Direct?</p>

      <p>Surprise us</p>
    <p>
I watched the Switch 2 reveal with a slight tinge of disappointment because I had hoped - even in the face of all the pragmatism - that Nintendo would surprise us. But the Switch 2 form factor, beyond a mysterious button and probable mouse-like controller usage, did not.
</p>
<p>
Thats fine, of course - slightly disappointing but fine - because it allows games to now come and do the talking, for Nintendo to show us that the creativity it's famed for still crackles through the halls of this celebrated game maker. Toy maker.
</p>
<p>
What I don't want to see today, then, is a reliance on iterative franchise updates. That's what the hardware is: iterative. I want to see new ideas. I want to see Nintendo reaffirm itself as the company thinking beyond the boundaries of gaming that we're used to, taking apart the concept of play and rethinking it.
</p>
<p>
And yes I understand that Mario Kart 9 won't necessarily be that - though I'm still holding out hope for some reinvention there - but there's plenty of space for something else to surprise us. Please, Nintendo, surprise us.

      <p>Will Switch 2 enhance original Switch games?</p>
    <p>If the Switch 2 does anything to improve original Switch games, there are a few I'd love to see enhanced. BotW and TotK both stand out as games that I'd love to play at 60FPS at a decent resolution on my TV, but who knows if this level of upgrade is possible - well, Nintendo knows, and will hopefully tell us later.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for Yoshi's Crafted World, which is super soft looking and would benefit from a res boost. But, my biggest wish is that Bayonetta 3 is spruced up as it feels like a game struggling to shine on the OG Switch. What are your hopes?</p>

      <p>Lots of Ninten-dough</p>
    <p>There's lots of speculation about the price of the Switch 2, but whatever it comes in at we're looking at a chunky spend for day one buyers. If we make some reasonable guesses for the prices of the hardware and games, well, it won't be a good day for the credit card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch 2 console: £400</li>
<li>Switch 2 Joy-Con Pair: £65</li>
<li>Switch 2 game: £60</li>
<li>512GB Micro SD Card: £40</li>
</ul>
<p>The console, a second set of Joy-Con, memory card, and two games would be £625. Ouch!</p>

      <p>Joy-Contentment?</p>
    <p>Nintendo loves a new colour Joy-Con almost as much as it loves making money (maybe the two are linked?). At the OG Switch launch buyers had to choose between the sleek grey or the more fun blue and red. It's hard to believe Nintendo won't launch a whole range of different colours for its Switch 2 Joy-Con range, but I wouldn't be overly surprised to see day one buyers limited to the black we've seen shown off already. They are starkly un-kiddy, which would make sense given early adopters are likely to be kids only at heart, not age. Still, I'd expect some red ones for Mario, green for Pikmin, and blue-ish for Zelda(?) at some point.</p>

  </time></p><p>Another great point: Nintendo's Switch 2 does face more competition than the Switch 1 did, with the likes of the Steam Deck and Asus' Rog Ally being out there, and the prospect of whatever <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-2025-gaming-handheld-teased-in-new-trailer">the Xbox handheld</a> will be. It's a busier market now.</p>

Some great questions cropping up in the comments. Will legacy games get a boost if played on Switch 2? Back compatibility is a feature here, remember. Also, what are the chances of a new 3D Mario being teased today, or more? As Tom pointed out in his comment, Switch 1's first year brought us Odyssey - what will Switch 2's first year bring? And where on Nintendo's list of priorities is a new Animal Crossing, as Will rightly wonders?
</p>
<p>A new generation does tend to be a great time to introduce new IP, as well, as we saw Nintendo do with Arms on Switch 1 and Splatoon on Wii U. Is there a new franchise waiting in the wings for Switch 2?</p>

      <p>The missing Link?</p>
    <p>There's always excitement around a new console, but there's something extra special about a Nintendo console reveal because you can't help but expect something a little different. I'm sure we'll hear something about the system offering something we didn't expect (or at least already know about), but I'm most interested in finding out what games Nintendo has planned.</p>
<p>The original Switch had a brilliant first year, notably launching with the possible game of that decade, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We also got Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Arms. My concern is that Switch 2 won't be able to better that, mainly because there won't be a new Zelda any time soon (barring a monumental surprise). Will the new Mario Kart be able to carry online discussion like Zelda did? We'll see.</p>

    <p>
Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-final-switch-2-tease-shows-mysterious-c-button">Nintendo has lifted the lid slightly on the mysterious "C" button on the Switch 2</a>. A new video posted on the Nintendo Today app shows it being pressed and sounding a little jingle and then... Well, that's as much as we were allowed to see. Could it be a shortcut button to capture gameplay, or to get to social features on the console, and what might they be if there?

			<p>Publisher ESDigital Games and developer Storm in a Teacup have announced a slight delay to the release date of the upcoming stealth action/adventure game Steel Seed. Previously scheduled to launch on April 10, the game will now debut on April 22.</p>
<p>Ilia Svanidze, Head of Marketing of ESDigital Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Since the game’s announcement, your excitement has been truly inspiring, and we know how much you've been looking forward to a deep dive into a dark sci-fi future on all platforms. That’s why we want to be completely open with you: We encountered some technical hurdles related to platform adaptation when running our platform certification tests. Rather than rushing the console release and risking a potentially substandard console user experience that requires swift patching, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to delay the launch. Our goal is to ensure that all players, regardless of platform, enjoy a polished and seamless experience. We are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our players. This additional time will allow us to optimize and polish all versions for launch so they meet the standard we know you deserve.</em></p>

Do you have the capacity to allow another deckbuilder into the overcrowded dining car of your brain? I probably don't. But I do have fond memories of the first game's crunchy runs and over-the-top card combos. Hmmm, maybe another rail trip or two hundred <em>would</em> be nice. </p>

<p>The release date is May 21st, said developers Shiny Shoe in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1102190/view/502820742193219263">a Steam post</a>. They shared the news on April 1st, and so felt the need to clarify that this was an actual factual release date announcement - not a silly April Fools jest. They opted for a straightforward announcement because they didn't want to do "a disservice to the entire dating sim genre" by revealing a shallow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train">Monster Train</a> dating sim spinoff called "You Stole My Pyre Heart".</p>
<p>"This does not exist," they say, "please do not ask for it. We’re giving you Monster Train 2. Please."</p>
<p>The sequel will involve a similar violent train ride as the first game, in which you essentially play three or four games of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at once. But whereas you previously fought as the demons of hell against the angels of heaven, this time you'll combine the warring forces to battle a new enemy - the ancient Titans. </p>
<p>It's set to include "five all-new clans, dozens of new cards, and surprises of all shapes and sizes". This includes "Room" cards which will have some effect on the space you're fighting within. You'll also be able to get "new parts for your train and customize it to suit your personal style". A fashionable new cow catcher perhaps?</p>
<p>The first Monster Train was a maximalist numberwang of flashing delights, according to Matt (RPS in peace), who said it was "at least as good as Slay The Spire." Here's a snippet of thoughts I enjoy from his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-review">Monster Train review</a>. </p>
<blockquote>I'm not comfortable saying it's outright better. Not yet, at least, but I will say this: before Monster Train came along I couldn't see myself ever obsessing over a deckbuilder in the same way that I did with the Spire. It seemed too immaculate to meaningfully improve on, but there are plenty of specific ways in which the Train does exactly that.</blockquote>
<p>Good thing you can play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-2-revealed-for-2025-release-and-you-can-play-the-demo-right-now">a demo of the upcoming sequel</a> already, if you, like Matt and I, are inclined to monstering with numbers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Inzoi has barely been out, and it’s already got the famous WickedWhims mod seen in The Sims. The user-created content is designed to let you experience Inzoi in a more unrestricted and uncensored fashion, and it was only a matter of time.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle-all-included-dlc-for-the-sims-1-and-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a> has always taken a lighthearted approach to intimate human activity. The action is usually pixelated and presented in a comedic yet casual fashion. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> is 2025’s realistic take on everyday life and features the usual hustle and bustle of existence: Jobs, Taxes, Death, and the creation of life.</p>



<p>It also keeps any intimate moments well hidden. But if you install the WickedWhims mod, you might want to play privately. </p>



<h2 id="h-controversial-the-sims-wickedwhims-mod-arrives-in-inzoi">Controversial The Sims WickedWhims Mod Arrives in Inzoi</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The mod gives you action more intense than this. Credit to Inzoi Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>X user <a href="https://x.com/WickedWhims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TURBODRIVER</a> is back at it again with mods. They are the creator of the WickedWhims mods—as seen in The Sims. In Inzoi, it allows you to “Undress anything you want at any moment without censorship getting in the way.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, you can: “Get on a bed, or on a sofa, or the floor, or anywhere you want to get freaky with anybody you want.” The mod promises fully interactive animations and realistic interactions between Zois. This is only possible because the game doesn’t support <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deunvo</a>.</p>



<p>The official mod’s site has four simple instructions required to install the mod. Once you’ve done this, your copy of Inzoi becomes steamier and hotter in a matter of seconds! Don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>



<p>Inzoi has already been in the headlines of late as it was discovered you could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children</a>. This was later addressed by the developer who claimed the action to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug, and it was patched</a>.</p>

        <p>But mysterious mobile game is apparently not.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Back in 2020, streaming giant Netflix announced a partnership with Ubisoft to create streaming "content" based on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">including at least one live-action TV series</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Five years and several <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> later, however, and we're yet to see Netflix's TV project materialise.
</p>
<p>
Has the project been quietly canned? Not so, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/i/160364118/item-what-about-netflixs-assassins-creed">Game File</a>, which reported that the series is still in "active" development as part of an article featuring a chat with Netflix's gaming boss Alain Tascan.
</p>
<p>
Few details have ever been announced on the Netflix Assassin's Creed series, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was briefly attached</a> for a period. 
</p>
<p>
A mysterious <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/assassins-creed-mobile-game?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Assassin's Creed mobile game announced by Netflix and Ubisoft in 2022</a> - of which we knew nothing at all - is no longer in development, Tascan appeared to suggest.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first Assassin's Creed Netflix project to fall by the wayside. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania  animated series. However, the project ultimately failed to materialise.
</p>
<p>
Last month, speaking at GDC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">Tascan said he believed consoles were not the future as the streamer looks to phone-controlled party games</a>. "Are eight year-olds and ten year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6?" he wondered.

            <p>Developer Rebellion is celebrating its "most successful launch" ever with the release of Atomfall, a game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">our Ian showered in praise</a> after it allowed him to bash a man over the head with a cricket bat as he (the man, not Ian) was having a wee against a wall.</p>
<p>The studio announced its pseudo-apocalyptic survival game - set in the rather splendid ol' chap that is 1950s rural England - had already reached 1.5 million players since its debut at the end of March.</p>
<p>"A pleasure having you observe Protocol in Wyndham," the Atomfall developer celebrated on social media.</p>

<p>Along with this impressive player milestone, Rebellion has also shared some thoroughly British Atomfall statistics.</p>
<p>Among us, we have managed to devour 4m pasties, and savour 300,000 cups of tea, which, honestly, seems quite low to me, given I probably drink that in about a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there have been 3.7m kills with a cricket bat (and only 1m of those were Ian). Lastly, want to know how many players killed the scientist right at the start of Atomfall? That's 316,000 of us.</p>

            <p>There are few things more heartwarming than a solo developer seeing breakout success, especially if their game is a wholesome testament to community spirit, entrepreneurship, and innovative street cleaning solutions like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a>. Pretty close, though, is a solo developer pulling a 'Miyazaki lying about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>', and underselling just how big their game actually is in the run-up to release.</p>
<p>Developer Tyler has been updating the bud flinging <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulator</a> steadily throughout the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205720/Schedule_I_Free_Sample/">demo release</a> and into the current early access, and they've also got a roadmap <a href="https://trello.com/b/VQQpru3F/schedule-i-roadmap">over at Trello here</a> (featuring: raids, parkour, jukeboxes, and controller support among other things). Some of the most relevant communication is actually in the Steam forums though. Tyler revealed yesterday that he's currently working on getting the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> verified. It's also where he first revealed the full list of planned sellables that are now in the roadmap (Marijuana, Meth, Cocaine, Shrooms, MDMA, and delicious + cool Heroin), with plans to take community suggestions once they're all in.</p>

<p>But my favourite interaction I've seen is one where Tyler comments on a thread simply titled <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3164500/discussions/1/591764116171920329/">"Raise The Price"</a>, where the poster offers 50 or even $100. "Haha I appreciate it but I think $20 is fair," writes Tyler. "On release I'm confident the game will be able to easily provide 15+ hours of entertainment (not just mindless grinding)".</p>
<p>I'm only a few hours into the demo myself, but as far as I can tell, that's either vastly underselling how much stuff there is to actually do in Schedule I, or vastly underestimating how much a good portion of the game's 30,000 or so players enjoy just pissing around in this thing. It's got that crackful combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Sim</a> zen mixed with the steady, bankable progress of the the self-replicating factory genre. You buy one plant, earn enough for two plants, two plants turns into six plants. You automate certain tasks, you expand others. You can rope a co-op mate in to grind like mad, but you can also just explore the streets picking up litter at your own pace.</p>
<p>I'm actually left wondering if Tyler only ever intended that 15 hours, and the community has just found myriad unforeseen methods of piss aboutery. Either way, it's refreshing to see a game pull the rare underpromise, although I imagine its easier when you haven't got a publisher hounding you to promise free back massages and cures for depression with every copy.</p>

<p>Tyler also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913">dropped a patch</a> yesterday. Blackjack dealers will no longer reveal their hand early to non-host players, an image I enjoy greatly. First person jackets are less janky now, and you'll have to work harder for the 'Master Chef' achievement, which was being awarded prematurely.</p>
<p>Are you playing [new viral Steam game we're required to write about to stay relevant and profitable in these dark times]? What do you think of [new viral Steam game we're required to write about to stay relevant and profitable in these dark times]? Would you…kiss [new viral Steam game we're required to write about to stay relevant and profitable in these dark times]? I'm half joking here, honestly. I think Schedule I is pretty good. It avoids the self-seriousness of other drug dealer sims I've seen while also having a bit more meat to it than just "eh, drugs are funny, right? No need to make an actual game". Do add that parkour, though. I want to find out how high up I have to be to knock someone out with a cigarette butt.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a>'s most mysterious button has been teased by Nintendo, ahead of the new console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">full unveiling in just a few hours</a>.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has, to date, avoided speficially highlighting the mysterious "C" button located on the Switch 2's right-hand Joy-Con. Indeed, when the Switch 2 was first revealed, the button's face was left completely blank. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">image posted to Nintendo Today last week did however finally show the button's lettering</a>, if you squint.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, we will finally find out its true purpose. A new video <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">posted to the Nintendo Today app</a> promoting this afternoon's Nintendo Direct focuses fully on that C button, and shows it being pressed. A little jingle plays. But what just happened?
</p>
<p>
Fan theories point to this being some kind of capture or social button, allowing you to more easily share gameplay or discuss what you're currently playing with others. Could this be a feature similar to the Wii U's much-missed Miiverse, perhaps?
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, Nintendo teased another new Switch 2 hardware feature - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mouse-functionality-all-but-confirmed-thanks-to-latest-console-teaser">the mouse-like controls of the console's fresh Joy-Con</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We now have only a few hours until Switch 2's secrets are revealed. Be sure to join us at 2pm UK time later today, 2nd April 2025, for the main event.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a full demo of the Switch 2's hardware, Nintendo is expected to unveil the key games which it will launch its new console with, most notably including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Switch 2 Mario Kart</a> glimpsed earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to finally hear word of the Switch 2's launch date and price, with a release expected around June - after the culmination of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's public Switch 2 hands-on tour</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-tomorrow-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remake-could-be-released-tomorrow-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1151745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-tomorrow-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by an insider that the Oblivion remake that has been the talk of the town for a while could suddenly be released <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Recently, it was suggested by <strong>another </strong>rumour that the Oblivion remake would be released ‘sooner than expected’, and April was touted as being the month when the reveal would take place.</p>



<p>However, this all-new claim suggests that the game will just be dropped without warning. It’s time to take out the salt bowl and grab a pinch, folks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-our-dreams">In Our Dreams</h2>



<p>The slew of rumours that have emerged regarding the Oblivion remake haven’t been all that wild, but we’re yet to see <strong>anything </strong>about the project. Per the claims, it’s in development at Virtuous Games and will be a full-blown rebuild of the 2006 title in Unreal Engine 5. It has been suggested that considerable upgrades have also been made to the game’s mechanics and combat systems.</p>



<p>It sounds great, but we don’t know a thing about it, including which platforms it’ll be released on, how much it’ll cost, and <strong>what it will look like</strong>.</p>



<p>On March 13, Nate The Hate posted on social media that he was expecting ‘news’ on the Oblivion remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-coming-sooner-than-expected-its-claimed/">to surface in April</a> and that the release date for the game could be earlier than ‘the original June target’.</p>



<p>April is earlier than June, right?</p>



<p>Now, Detective Seeds has posted on Twitter with an all-new claim:</p>



<div><article><p><span>I believe the Oblivion remake is going to release end of next week, likely Thursday April 3rd.  Then 13 days later Indiana jones on the 16th on PS5, and then 13 days later forza horizon 5 on 29th on PS5.</span></p></article></div>







<p>He expanded in the comments, covering his tracks slightly by placing the responsibility of the rumour on an undisclosed source, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a little iffy if it is going to be this week or next. They were confident in it coming though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, we’re not <strong>really </strong>any closer to getting the truth. It could be tomorrow, it could be next week, or it could be June. Strangely, nothing has been revealed just yet, but a UE5 Elder Scrolls game, even a remake, would be a <strong>very welcome arrival </strong>right now.</p>



<p>Do you think the Oblivion remake rumours are real? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>I remember Croc from when I was a kid, and even though the details are a little hazy after nearly 30 years, nostalgia had me looking forward to revisiting Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. After playing the remaster, I’m questioning whether I did actually enjoy this game, or if it was a case of donning rose tinted glasses.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2SZtxMF2Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite these newfound doubts over my younger self’s taste, I 100% completed Croc: Legend of the Gobbos during this review, though it was more out of stubbornness than any real sense of enjoyment.</p>


<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos starts off with a brief introduction for the background of our main character. As a baby he was placed in a basket and sent floating downriver, eventually being found by the Gobbos who adopted Croc as one of their own, like a narrative cross between Moses, Mowgli and… well, a crocodile. Life was good until the Gobbo village was invaded by Baron Dante and his forces, with all of the Gobbos being kidnapped as part of this takeover. Croc manages to escape and embarks on a mission to free his Gobbo family from Baron Dante’s clutches.</p>


<p>The game itself is split into four areas – five if you count the secret island – each with their own levels to navigate. Each of these levels has a pretty similar set up, generally split into a few rooms filled with obstacles that you need to get past, be they enemy Dantinis, traps or locks. Most rooms will also contain a Gobbo and a Colour Crystal too. Coming from the earliest days of 3D platforming, it’s no surprise that Croc slips into some familiar tropes with these settings, taking you from Forest to Ice, Desert and Castle islands, each with a string of levels that build up to mini-boss and main boss levels.</p>
<p>The secret fifth island, the Crystal Island, needs you to grab all the Gobbos and then the jigsaw pieces in secret levels, though most of the Gobbos and Colour Crystals are on your main path, with only a bit of extra manoeuvring required. Sometimes Gobbos can only be rescued by completing a mini-game. Failure means you do not get that Gobbo, and the only way is to, annoyingly, restart the level.</p>

<p>That is probably the least annoying thing about Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. The most egregious issue is the platforming in the game. It just has no real consistency when it comes to navigating from one section to another. I couldn’t tell you how many times Croc slipped off a platform, failed to grab a ledge, or just seemed to fall from certain areas of his own accord. This has to be a hang over from the 90s where games seemed to have been made like this, either just from a lack of mastery of control schemes and physics, or deliberately to pad out the playtime. You could line up the camera perfectly and assume you have the best line for a jump, only for Croc to fall short of the gap.</p>
<p>Another issue was some of the enemy placements, where in some instances they are practically unavoidable meaning you lose your crystals or a life if you have no crystals. Hit boxes are also off, with there being examples of Croc being hit or killed by an enemy that is in the near vicinity but not touching him. Bosses are easy fights but have this hitbox issue.</p>

<p>The music sounds good in Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, though can get repetitive and annoying if you’re hearing the same tune for the umpteenth time. The game’s graphics are decent as well, this high resolution remaster looking nice on modern screens, bursting with colour. The Crocopedia is a nice touch as well, hosting concept art, photos of the original merchandise, and videos with the development team about their time working on Croc: Legend of the Gobbos.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster is a good look at how 3D platformers were put together in the 90s, but the gameplay falls seriously short of modern standards. There is just so much that could be better when it comes to the gamplay that would have made the experience more tolerable and enjoyable, but what we have is a bang average 3D platformer.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-international-2025-schedule-format-and-structure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The International is one of the most prestigious esports events in history. It has boasted some of the largest prize pools in competitive gaming, and it draws in millions of viewers every year. It’s considered the pinnacle of the industry by many, and it’s set to surface again in 2025.</p>



<p>Valve has outlined the schedule and format for The International 2025, but more granular details are yet to be revealed. This page will be updated as the information is released by Valve, but for now, you can read on to learn about The International 2025 schedule and format.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-road-to-the-international-2025">The Road to The International 2025</h2>



<p>Valve has highlighted that The Road to The International will start on Thursday, September 4 and will run until September 7. It’ll include two Swiss rounds and their successive elimination roads, and it’ll lead to eight teams out of the sixteen invited being eliminated.</p>



<p>The remaining eight teams will advance to the arena environment for The International proper.</p>



<p>Here’s how The Road to The International <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/536597286667419796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will work in 2025</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This year, The Road to The International starts with a five-round Swiss bracket: Over the first three days, sixteen teams will play best-of-three matches against other teams with the same series record (a 2:0 team will face another 2:0 team, a 1:3 team will face another 1:3 team, etc.). A fourth series win will cause that team to automatically advance to The International; a fourth loss will cause that team to be eliminated.</p>



<p>After five rounds of Swiss, the three teams with four wins will have secured their spot in The International and the three teams with four losses will have been eliminated. The ten remaining teams will face-off in a special elimination round (strongest against weakest) with the five winners advancing to the International and the five losers being eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-international-2025-schedule">The International 2025 Schedule</h2>



<p>This year’s The International will start on Thursday, September 11. It’ll unravel in the arena over a four-day window, with the Grand Finasl taking place on Sunday, September 14.</p>



<p>The eight teams that make it to The International will compete in front of a grand crowd in Barclays Arena, with the winner claiming an undisclosed prize pool and lifting the Aegis.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-where-is-the-international-2025">Where is The International 2025?</h3>



<p>The International 2025 will take place in the Barclays Arena in Hamburg, Germany. It’s a top venue with a capacity of 15,000, and it’ll likely sell out very fast as The International 2025 approaches.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-international-2025-prize-pool">What is The International 2025 Prize Pool?</h3>



<p>The prize pool is yet to be determined for The International 2025. Last year’s tournament had a pool of $2.7 million, but in 2021, the record was set when the prize pool reached $40 million. Since then, the pool has decreased rapidly, but the expectation is that it’ll be <strong>at least </strong>$2.5 million this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-many-teams-are-at-the-international-2025">How Many Teams Are at The International 2025?</h3>



<p>The Road to The International starts with sixteen invited teams, but the elimination brackets will remove eight of them. There will be eight teams that make it to The International 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-which-team-is-the-favourite-to-win-the-international-2025">Which Team is the Favourite to Win The International 2025?</h3>



<p>It’s tough to gauge the competition this early on. The most recent winner of The Invitational was Team Liquid, but for the last two tournaments, Gaimin Gladiators have claimed a second-place spot. Could this be the year for the European organisation to finally win?</p>

While we still don't know what the mystery button does, we now know what sound it will make when it's pressed.</p><p>In a brief clip shared on Nintendo Today, the C button--a mysterious input that sits below the home button and is simply labelled "C"--is shown to make a cute noise when pressed. The clip is followed by a reminder that the Switch 2 Direct is happening today (in some time zones), when we will presumably find out for sure what the new button does.</p><p>The sound in the video is a classic piece of quirky Nintendo sound design, with some comparing it to the distinctive Mii sound effects. The reveal has renewed speculation over the button's function, with the Mii comparison leading some fans to guess that the C could stand for "connect" or "community," and would enable social features for the console.</p><p>Another popular guess is that the C button is a capture button, and the sound in the video is Nintendo's take on a screenshot sound effect.

Back in January, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Switch 2 teaser trailer was released</a>, Nintendo confirmed the full reveal would be Wednesday, April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p><p dir="ltr">This Nintendo Direct will focus solely on the Nintendo Switch 2, though Nintendo has not confirmed any specific details that will be shown. Rumors and speculation expect new features--including the supposed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-rumored-mouse-functionality-heres-how-it-could-be-used/2900-6247/">mouse functionality</a> of the console's Joy-Con controllers--as well as release date and price.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to watch the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DXUmjX7DsP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct will be available to stream on Nintendo's official </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nintendo">YouTube</a><span> (embedded above) and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a><span> channels.

Aside from that, no official details have been presented for the console, but that is expected to change in a big way with this Switch 2 Direct.</p><p dir="ltr">With a new Nintendo console comes expectations for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">new entries in the company's many franchises</a>, and the already-confirmed Mario Kart and a new 3D Super Mario adventure in the vein of Super Mario Odyssey are among the most-rumored potential announcements. The term "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-may-have-given-away-a-clue-about-how-some-switch-2-games-will-work/1100-6530436/" data-ref-id="1100-6530436">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Game</a>" also surfaced after last week's Nintendo Direct, which could hint at upgraded versions of existing Nintendo Switch games--with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild chief among the rumored upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">From a third-party standpoint, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know-about-team-cherrys-metroidvania/1100-6520282/" data-ref-id="1100-6520282">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> continued its elusion of the news cycle with its absence from last Thursday's Nintendo Direct, which has led to speculation that it may appear in the Switch 2 presentation. Microsoft is also a common topic on the rumor mill after it delivered multiple games to the original Switch, though the company has not confirmed anything for Nintendo's new console yet.</p>
