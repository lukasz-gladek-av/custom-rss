<p>Many insects are matriarchal creatures. For termites, honey bees, praying mantises, ants, and spiders (shh, I know they’re arachnids), their colonies and societies are led by females or defined by female-controlled structures. They range from groups driven by female workers to matriarchs responsible for breeding and raising the entire colony.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957kwsrhv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So it makes perfect sense that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a game governed by its women. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> certainly embraces part of this with its true final boss in The Radiance. But from its very first encounter all the way to the finale, Silksong’s women drive the plot forward. It goes way beyond being led by Hornet, a half-spider, half-wyrm who became The Knight’s ally in the first game.</p>
<p>In Pharloom and the Citadel, a world ensnared by silk and gripped by song, women are everything. Women are guides who help Hornet and chart the corridors of Pharloom. They’re powerful keepers of knowledge who bear the history of this broken kingdom will do whatever it takes to save it. They’re mothers, sisters, daughters, family who love and have let down, who have been forgotten or driven mad. They’re people who have suffered and struggled and continue to struggle.</p>
<p>Hornet herself is the perfect hero for Silksong’s narrative, one defined by systems of oppression, of familial and generational trauma, of class divides and religious control. Initially stripped of many of her powers and skills, she struggles and climbs — physically and mentally — to the top of the Citadel, before collapsing back down to the bottom. I know I’m beating the drum of “the struggle is the point” here, but the gameplay ties so beautifully with those aforementioned themes, including womanhood, I will continue to beat the same rhythm.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ecfb1a2b1b397"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecfb1a2b1b397/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of Silksong's toughest challenges come in the form of female figures. The Last Judge, the notorious roadblock between the end of Act 1 and the beginning of Act 2, is among the most fearsome bosses in the game, battering you with a fiery thurible and crimson embers over and over again, in a chamber drowning in her bellowing screams and her face obscured by what looks like a tear-stained mask.</p>
<p>Then there are the Weavers – Widow and her tricks that use threads to manipulate bells and overwhelm Hornet, while First Sinner is a lightning-fast combatant who teleports and zips around the arena breathlessly. These are female figures that define Pharloom’s history.</p>
<p>It isn’t like Hornet is weak, either. She’s a powerful woman raised by powerful women; her mother is Herrah the Beast, she trained under the Hive Queen Vespa, and was mentored for a time by The White Queen. She carries that strength, displaying confidence and pragmatism while always treating everyone with respect. Even when her eventual rival, Lace, taunts her on their first meeting, she does not mock her back: <em>“Your threats are worthless, child. If you are my foe, stay your voice and raise your blade.”</em></p>
<p>Just like how Hornet contrasts The Knight, other roles filled by men or male-presenting figures in Hollow Knight are now often held by women. Shakra is a very different cartographer than Cornifer; a warrior by nature, she is hunting for her missing mentor. She’s an immense help to Hornet throughout the game, defined by so much more than her strength and her ability to map the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="665b5377b312d"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/665b5377b312d/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, Shakra is a woman of tradition; she is found by scattered throwing rings and the dulcet tones of her singing voice. She comes to greatly respect Hornet throughout the journey, recognising her as a fellow warrior. And even though she’s not from the inner areas of Pharloom, like Bone Bottom or the Citadel, in Act 3 she still takes up the mantle as defender of Bellhart when the Void begins to overwhelm.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Bell Beast is your Last Stag of Silksong, and she’s the complete opposite. Active, vocal, and a fan of pets, Bella (yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-why-focus-on-silksongs-difficulty-when-we-need-to-talk-about-how-cute-it-is">I named her</a>) comes to love Hornet because she saved her from being ensnared in silk. Even if Hornet has to knock a bit of sense into her.</p>
<p>And, like Shakra, the Bell Beast undergoes a bit of a transformation in Act 3. My heart leapt into my throat when I rang the bell at the Bellway and my trusty companion didn’t arrive, instead replaced by the Bell Eater. Luckily, I had nothing to worry about, as after confronting the monstrous centipede-like creature and struggling, the Beast emerges and takes it down. Reunited with her companion, she introduces her litter of adorable children, and the five of them sing as Hornet plays the Needolin.</p>

<p>The Bell Beast has a reason to protect Pharloom – she’s a mother. Acting as a mirror to Hollow Knight once again, which focused on failed father figures and broken families, Silksong casts a much wider net on the theme, encompassing mothers and mother-like figures from every corner of life. From the Moss Mother to the splinters and the ants, as anyone who walked into Hunter’s March early on and got battered to death knows, family and motherhood is the heart of Silksong.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ants, the once-great leader, Skarrsinger Karmelita (matriarchal ants, remember?), is among the strongest characters I faced in Silksong. Before diving into her memory, she asks Hornet, “My strength... my power... Could you claim it, pale beast? Are you so strong?...”, which is pretty apt because in her prime, Karmelita humbled me with both her aria and her battle prowess for <em>hours.</em> Given that she was the only leader who could protect her tribe from the allure of the silk (for a time) thanks to the power of her voice, her strength should be no surprise.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15dd1dca43aee"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15dd1dca43aee/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>She is a mix of stereotypical masculine and feminine qualities, but her position as matriarch, as leader, is undeniable. Graceful, respectful, and with hundreds of loyal followers who support and protect her, she’s a great contrast to the aptly-named Grand Mother Silk, the figure behind all of Pharloom's ills. Where Karmelita cares about her tribe, Grand Mother wishes only to be the absolute ruler.</p>
<p>As a pale higher being who was abandoned by her “daughters” (the Weavers), Grand Mother Silk is haunting the silk and using her power to get people to worship her, driving them mad. She even goes as far as to fashion more children from silk to love her. One of those is Lace, a dutiful daughter driven mad by her desire to simply make her mother happy. She is the child of a mother who has done many bad things, burdened with the weight of those sins and the choices she has to make for her parental figure, including bringing Hornet to Pharloom to satisfy her.</p>

<p>Eventually, it drives Lace to self-loathing: If you play the Needolin during the second fight with her in The Cradle, she’ll sing <em>“Why her... Mother… See me cut! See me serve!”</em> Eventually, Lace rebels and at the start of Act 3, she cuts her mother’s arm off to free Hornet from falling into the Void. Lace instead goes down, but her mother does make one sacrifice: she cocoons Lace to protect her as best as she can, at the gradual cost of her soul.</p>
<p>Lace’s attempt at breaking free from her mother, of lashing out at her, results in her becoming dependent on her. Pharloom is still ensnared by the pale mother’s silken grip, now tainted with the darkness below. And it’s only right that Lace is saved by Hornet at the end, pulled from the Void and allowed to live freely. Lace made that choice by cutting her mother’s arm off, and Hornet allows her to see that choice through.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9bf2b4f2004f5"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9bf2b4f2004f5/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Women breaking free and taking a stand happens throughout Silksong; Shakra and the Bell Beast were just two examples, and while it isn’t exclusive to women, it does feel different when framed through their struggles.</p>
<p>Even Hornet’s journey, beyond simply freeing Pharloom, is about breaking free and retaining her agency. Slapping Nuu at the first signs of approach or scolding Kratt after he spies on her in the flea spa are a few simple moments of this – ones that made me chuckle at first, but later realise just how important they were to maintaining Silksong’s respect for its female characters.</p>
<p>This respect stretches to the path to the Cursed Child ending and getting the Witch Crest. This involves putting Hornet through a horrendous experience that “curses” her after a parasite is forcibly inserted into her body. It completely changes how Hornet’s body functions and how she plays – she can’t heal, she can’t use tools, and she can’t use Silk Skills.</p>
<figure data-uuid="997510ca30c95"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/997510ca30c95/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Even Grindle gets a taste of Hornet's medicine — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this “curse”, Hornet can either defeat Grand Mother Silk, or she can seek the help of Yarnaby, a disgraced doctor who was kicked out of Bellhart because of her practices. It’s a not-subtle story about bodily autonomy, forced motherhood, and overcoming trauma. Yarnaby, an outcast, extracts the “curse” from Hornet, which in turn gives you the Witch Crest.</p>
<p>We all know the historical connotations of the word '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(archetype)">witch</a>', especially related to women and the persecution we (and many others) have so often faced when branded with that term. But quests like this remind us that choice is a powerful thing and, if we have the space to make a choice, we should, for we — everyone — define ourselves by our choices.</p>

<p>Without womanhood, and without its women, Silksong would be a very different game. It ties into all of the thematic riches of the narrative beautifully, and there are so many powerful women throughout Pharloom, beyond even the few I’ve talked about, such as Jubilana, Neyleth, and the Forge Daughter.</p>
<p>When I reflect on Silksong, I think about all the girls who grew up playing video games, particularly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>. Seeing Samus remove her suit for the first time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/soapbox_super_metroid_showed_me_i_had_the_right_to_exist">must have been incredible</a>; I knew about this ‘twist’ before playing any game, and it still felt incredible to be playing as a woman with power and autonomy in a way few other games have since.</p>
<p>Hornet might just be “a bug”, but her journey throughout Pharloom is an important one for women. We’re not perfect beings, and Silksong isn’t shy about saying that. Hornet herself messes up in not recognising the Snail Shaman’s plans to use the Void to trap Grand Mother Silk. But she makes a choice to save these people, to liberate those who have suffered under the silken thread for so long. To free herself of the curse. To save Lace and let her live her own life.</p>
<p>Amidst the oppression of Pharloom, there is hope, there is a chance to break free. And the women will lead the charge.</p>

            <p>Former Rockstar technical director, Obbe Vermeij, has commended <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios for walking away from the hugely successful Dungeons &amp; Dragons series, calling it a "bold move".</p>
<p>Reflecting on the difficulties of moving on from critically-acclaimed properties - much like when he himself moved on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> in 2009 after games like GTA 3, GTA 4, Vice City, and San Andreas - Vermeij spoke to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">Games Hub</a> in a wide-ranging interview, intimating Larian had made a "risky" decision.</p>

<p>"It's quite cool to see Larian Studios, who just did Baldur’s Gate 3, and they've said, 'we don't feel like Baldur’s Gate 4. We're just gonna do another game'. And you know, good for them.</p>
<p>"But it's a bold move. It's not obvious. It's very risky. It's easier to just keep on doing what you’re doing.</p>
<p>"The reality is if you have a studio that has one mega successful game, it just doesn't make sense to do any wild changes," he added (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-4-larian-turned-down-rockstar-lead-respect/">TheGamer</a>), suggesting that it was tempting to "put [whatever weird ideas you have] into GTA rather than just launching an entirely new game".</p><p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow up on its use of generative AI</a>, following a huge backlash earlier this month. In a statement, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include any AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Vermeji is now working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044790/Plentiful/">Plentiful</a>, a sandbox god game where you can sculpt the land, redirect rivers, and guide your people "through a perilous Stone Age".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>

              <p>Looking to improve your gaming PC? You may need a new graphics card. The latest and greatest may be a little expensive, but you could always do with a sale-priced upgrade so you can save a bit. We found one that’s heavily discounted now, and you can not only get it for a low price, but it should do your computer some good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">You can find the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card on Amazon right now for $318</a>. In comparison to the original retail price of $470, that’s a discount of $152 and represents about a 32% savings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful GPU that can enhance all your gaming goals</h2>
<p>This ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060Ti is a powerful graphics card that includes all the features you’d need to play the newest games at 144Hz, do photo and video editing at high resolution, and still have room left over to run other (usually demanding) applications.</p>
<p>Based on NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, the 8 GB of GDDR7 memory will allow you to maintain high frame rates at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions with less lag. Even at higher resolutions you should be able to achieve frame rates above 60 FPS. You’ll also see lower power consumption when running with this card.</p>
<p>To support the unique demands of small form factor systems, ASUS has engineered this product to fit within most mini ITX and micro ATX enclosures. While this card does occupy two and a half slots, it’s much smaller than most other graphics cards and leaves ample room to install additional hardware inside your enclosure. It does a great job at balancing both airflow and cooling to maintain stable performance during heavy loads, and uses axial-tech fans and carefully located heat sinks to ensure that this card runs quietly and maintains low operating temperatures.</p>



<p>For the gamer, this graphics card provides a significant upgrade over both integrated and older discrete graphics cards. With this card you’ll get faster load times, smoother frame rates, and better management of modern features like ray tracing when you play supported titles. For creators, the increased memory and processing power of this graphics card will help with tasks such as video editing, 3D modeling, and multitasking, especially when your workloads require more than what a typical GPU can provide.</p>
<p>Overall, with its superior performance, compact size, and highly efficient cooling, the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card is an ideal graphics card for upgrading to for many PC builds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">Given the current sale price of $318, this graphics card is an affordable option to consider if you want to increase your PC performance without spending too much money.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, I went out to the theater and saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a>. Even as a big <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I walked out disappointed. But I don’t want to talk about that. Instead, I want to highlight a moment I was forced to watch <em>twice</em> due to some snafu at my local AMC. The moment in question involves some children hooking up a tube to a monkey’s face and farting into the other end. Hey Hollywood, what the fuck?</p> <p>We arrived to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> about 15 minutes before the movie started, and to our surprise, my wife and I noticed the trailers were already playing. Strange! We sat down and I caught a new trailer for Sony’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><em>Zootopia</em></a> knock-off, <em>GOAT</em>, which is a basketball movie about talking animals or something. Approximately one minute and 49 seconds into this trailer, I was surprised to see two young rhino girls using a tube and a gas mask to funnel a fart from one of the animals’ asses to the face of a sleeping monkey man.&nbsp; Here’s the moment in question.</p>

  <p>I looked around the theater, which was basically empty as we’d arrived fairly early, and questioned if I’d actually seen what I thought I’d seen. I mean, sure, animated movies for kids are filled with fart jokes, so it hardly seemed impossible that Sony’s <em>GOAT </em>would feature one. But having cartoon animal kids basically recreate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7c_GK40Dsjg">the fart mask stunt from <em>Jackass 2</em></a>&nbsp;as a silly moment caught me off guard. I shook it off and soon was lost in the opening minutes of <em>Fire and Ash</em>, the&nbsp;<em>GOAT&nbsp;</em>trailer a distant memory. Or so I thought.</p>

 <p>About 10 minutes later, someone seemingly complained that the movie had started early, and so the AMC restarted everything, trailers included. Mildly annoying, but it did make me giggle at all the people who had arrived late specifically to avoid trailers then being forced to watch them anyway. It also meant that I’d have a second chance to catch the fart joke. And yup, to my surprise, <em>GOAT</em> does indeed include a recreation of<em> Jackass 2’s</em> fart mask bit, complete with the victim retching and losing it.</p>

 <p>Folks, I’m not a prude. I love the <em>Jackass</em> movies. And I’m not above laughing at a fart joke or someone getting hit in the groin. But it feels like <em>GOAT </em>and the people involved were desperate to one-up all the other fart jokes in kids’ movies these days and, in the process, created something that feels like it crosses a line that I’m not even sure I can properly put my finger on. At the very least, moving forward, I’d like a warning before any trailers that feature kids recreating gross-out pranks from <em>Jackass</em> movies, okay?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Marvel Rivals has been getting increasingly creative with its skins, but today's reveal pushes the game to a new level. Lady Loki, a female version of the god of mischief, is coming to the in-game shop later this week, complete with a new voice lines from a (presumably) new voice actor. You can see the skin in action below.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🐍 Lurking and ready to strike!</p><p>"The fates do have their little surprises, do they not?

While the TV series' Sylvie is a popular take on the character in her own right, Lady Loki is typically depicted as a woman with long black hair, like we see in NetEase's shooter.</p>

      <p>Lady Loki in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>While past cosmetics have put filters on voice lines or included alternate sound/visual effects, this is the most transformative skin Marvel Rivals has seen to date, and raises the question of other potential character variants that could be included as cosmetic overhauls. That said, as far as I know, no one else on the roster has an alternate version as popular as Lady Loki that would require re-recorded voice lines. And I'd prefer characters who have taken up existing heroes' mantles (like Miles Morales, Shuri, or Kate Bishop) to get their own spot on the roster, rather than a reskin.&nbsp;</p><p>Future speculation aside, Lady Loki is real, but will only be available from January 2 to January 30, so if you're interested, make sure to pick her up while you can.

<p>Hej hej Felix!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As the new year approaches, it's the season of goodwill and change, new things and new horizons (and not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">NS2 Editions</a>), which means it's time for some news we've been sitting on for a little while. Yes, as you probably guessed from the headline, our lovely video producer Felix Sanchez is disembarking the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Felix — gentleman, scholar, musician, Mario Party devotee, and thoroughly top chap — joined Alex and Zion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24mflsHQuFs">at the start of 2022</a> and has been an absolute joy to work with over the past four years. While he's moving on to work for a company in his native Denmark, you can be sure the entire NL crew will be keeping in touch with this particularly lovely person.</p>
<p>Please check out his farewell video above, where he goes into a little more detail about his next chapter. We wish you nothing but the best, Mr Felix, and we hope to catch up with you IRL soon!</p>
<p>Ah, time. Let's close out this end-of-an-era post (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/video-after-six-wonderful-years-zion-is-leaving-nintendo-life">the second one</a> in only a handful of months, no less!) on a less-sad note: Here's 30 minutes of Felix chatting with Alex about his personal top five games of the year.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>We'll have more to announce soon on the future of the NL YouTube team (don't worry, Alex isn't going anywhere!), so keep an eye out for exciting news on the video front. Until then, we love you, Felix!</em></p></section></article><div><p>Gavin first wrote for Nintendo Life in 2018 before joining the site full-time the following year, rising through the ranks to become Editor.

<p>As for how <em>Bloodborne's</em> online features will function in future versions of <strong>ShadPS4</strong>, it is too early to say.

You'll still be able to play the game, and it'll still appear as part of your Steam library.

What sets its new Swift Drive controller apart is a small steering wheel located smack-dab in the middle of the gamepad that’s connected to what GameSir calls the “world’s smallest direct drive motor” providing force feedback effects for racing games.</p><p>Pricing and availability hasn’t been announced yet, but GameSir has revealed plenty of details about the Swift Drive’s features and functionality. The steering wheel uses a “high-precision” Hall effect encoder with “up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering.” Its movement can be adjusted between 30 and 1080 degrees of rotation, and the wheel itself can be removed and swapped with alternate styles. Hall effect sensors are also used in the Swift Drive’s joysticks and buttons, while its triggers are further enhanced with individual haptic motors to simulate the feeling of ABS braking and wheel slip.</p><p>The Swift Drive will rely on a 2.4GHz wireless connection to your gaming machine and, even with reactive RGB lighting effects and its various haptic motors, battery life is estimated to be between 20 to 30 hours between charges.</p><p>For racing sim fans not as concerned with portability, GameSir’s new Turbo Drive provides a more traditional steering wheel and pedal setup with a yoke-style wheel that clamps to a desk. Like the smaller Swift Drive controller it features 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, Hall effect sensors in the wheel’s encoder, throttle controls, and shifting paddles, plus extensive customizability including limiting the wheel’s rotation. Its most unique feature is a built-in turbine fan that simulates airflow and enhances the feeling of speed. With the fan on, the Turbo Drive’s battery life is estimated to be around 15 hours, but turning it off will let you play for up to 50 hours before a charge is needed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/851259/gamesir-switch-turbo-drive-controller-steering-wheel-wireless-force-feedback]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-release-date-february-2026/</link>
            <guid>1394422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">Back in October, a rumour popped up</a> claiming that Warhorse Studios was working on a remaster of the first <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> game. There wasn't a lot to go off, since the rumour came from a lone source on Reddit, and while this source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">bertik11</a>, has previously been reliable about unreleased information from Warhorse Studios, it was still worth taking the news with a huge grain of salt.</p>



<p>That's still true, of course, though bertik11 has now added to his previous claim. They now specify that the remaster will arrive in February 2026, and that while players might've been hopeful for what a remaster of a game that is now seven years old (soon to be eight) at the time of this writing will look like, we shouldn't expect too much.</p>



<p>"<em>Two months ago I wrote about the upgrade of the first Kingdom Come and new game. Today I wanna share info about upcoming upgrade for next gen consoles</em>," bertik11 began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/">in a post on the GamingLeaksandRumors Reddit</a>. "<em>From what I’ve heard, a remaster of the original Kingdom Come is supposedly coming in February. Don’t expect too much, because as far as I’ve heard, it’s just going to be a port from PC. It won’t bring anything groundbreaking or entirely new — it’ll mostly just be a port for the new consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Again, this is all still just stemming from one unknown source who has previously been right when it comes to information on Warhorse Studios. Warhorse has not officially announced that it is making a remaster of the first Kingdom Come game, nor has it acknowledged its future plans now that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">is out, and all of its DLCs are available</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it would make perfect sense for Warhorse to work on an update like this, something to bolster the first game for current-gen consoles, and to capitalize on the success its sequel has enjoyed all year. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of the top-selling new games on Steam for 2025</a> and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominees for multiple awards, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025</a>. </p>



<p>It's also high on end-of-year lists for several publications, including Wccftech, as we have it on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Best Games of 2025</a> list,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"> Best Role-Playing Games</a> list, and even its DLC Mysteria Ecclesiae on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2025-expanding-the-fun/">Best DLC/Expansions</a> list. All this to say that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been one of 2025's defining titles, so it makes perfect sense for Warhorse to try and keep the series in players' minds by inviting them to return to the original.</p>



<p>Though if bertik11 is correct that the remaster will be closer to a port of the PC version to current-gen platforms instead of a deeper remaster, then how Warhorse handles it will be a huge element to how it is received. If it is just a port of the PC version, but there's no upgrade path for current owners, and they have to buy the full game all over again, or even worse, it's released as an entirely new game that everyone - PC players included - will have to buy again if they want all of the new graphical features, then that likely won't go over well with players who played and loved the game back in 2018. Nor will those who got into the series through the sequel be too enthused.</p>



<p>Of course, it's Warhorse's right to make those decisions if it likes, but it may go against capitalizing on the success of the sequel. Regardless, this whole rumor might not even be accurate, so we'll have to wait and see what happens in 2026.</p>

              <p>Need to give your home a visual upgrade? A set of colorful lights is a great way to do exactly this. And here’s the good news: you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to do it. In fact, we’ve found a way to do it without spending too much to kick off 2026, and we’ve brought that idea here to you in the form of a deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/">Get the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with Dual Cameras at Amazon for only $74.98, which saves you $65.02 (or approximately 46%) when compared to the normal retail price of $140.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A simple setup for enhancing your TV with backlights</h2>
<p>Govee’s Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with dual cameras gives you a new level of immersion when it comes to how you watch TV. The Envisual utilizes dual cameras to capture the colors of your TV screen in real-time, then sends those color captures to LED backlight effects behind your TV.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to add excitement and energy to the shows, movies, and games you watch on TV with exciting lighting effects that change with the content being displayed on screen, the Envisual T2 does exactly that. The best part is that you don’t have to learn a difficult setup just to attach some lighting to your TV. Nothing should be that complicated, and this setup doesn’t follow that convention.</p>



<p>To that end, installing the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is super quick and easy. The installation package comes with the exact LED strip components that go around the back of your TV and also two smaller cameras that you can install on to your TV frame. But despite seeming intimidating, the setup isn’t all that bad, so you’ll be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can control the lighting for your TV, too. The app allows you to adjust the intensity of the lighting, select various color effects that can be used for different viewing experiences, or choose a specific mode depending upon your viewing preferences. There’s a lot you can change here, and you’re really only limited by your creativity. That’s about it, especially if you’re willing to try a lot of different ideas.</p>
<p>We can’t really say it enough. This special backlight setup is a great way to make your TV feel that much more immersive. It’s a great viewing experience for anyone who wants to take their TV sessions to the next level. And when you factor in how much money you can save right now, that makes it an even better idea to go ahead and grab it right now.</p>

            <guid>1394413</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You expect well-known AAA franchises to land as they’ve established themselves for years. New games are always entering the limelight, and certain ones stand above the rest. 2025 has seen its fair share of newbies, and Insider Gaming has selected one surprise hit above all.</p>



<p>When a new year begins, while they might not necessarily be in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOTY</a> running, the annual Call of Duty, EA FC, etc, are going to sell like hotcakes and remain popular all year round. There will also be the games that are hyped up for an eternity, such as Hollow Knight: Silksong. So let’s honor the less-talked-about/hyped games and the impact they’ve had.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2025-winner-dispatch">Biggest Surprise Hit of 2025 Winner—Dispatch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>There have been workplace comedies about an office, a family, an American school, and many other things, but a superhero workplace comedy sounds like untapped potential. The Boys has been a breath of fresh air, changing the usual superhero narrative and perception. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a>, being a playable, customizable version of this, is terrific on paper.</p>



<p>When developer AdHoc Studio is comprised of various devs from Telltale Games, the chances of Dispatch’s success go up. Over 2 million copies sold in its first month and an 89/100 score on Metacritic later, and Dispatch has fought off all opposition to be one of 2025’s biggest breakout hits. The developer has said Dispatch will beat its estimated three-year sales target in three months—which is ridiculous.</p>



<p>Dispatch is replayable, fun, makes you think carefully about every decision you make, and it has more depth and things to do than even the best Telltale games. A subsequent AdHoc game won’t claim this award again, because people know the developer means business now, but it’s a worthy 2025 winner.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-surprise-hit-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Surprise Hit Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Insider Gaming 2025 lists feature Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in some capacity or another, to the point it’s almost boring! It would be wrong (borderline impossible) to ignore the game’s success, from breaking all-time The Game Awards records to selling 5 million units. Not many people really had Clair Obscur on their radar at the beginning of 2025, let alone knew who Sandfall Interactive was.</p>



<p>Now, at the end of 2025, even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/french-president-applauds-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">French President</a> knows about the game’s success. The uniqueness of Dispatch gives it the edge over Dispatch—and the fact that Sandfall features various former Ubisoft employees—but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is close.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pauline has unique abilities to help DK. Image via Nintendo </figcaption></figure>



<p>Hear us out: The Donkey Kong franchise is legendary and loved. It’s been around for over 40 years, and the majority of its formula has been established. Nintendo decided to do something bold and make Bananza a fully 3D platformer with a destructible environment. Realistically, the game was never going to be bad, but you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would confidently claim that Bananza would be a landslide knockout.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is the highest-rated DK game ever; it’s been nominated for umpteen awards and was even up for many Game of the Year accolades. The franchise name carries an exceptional amount of weight, but the release has surely given Nintendo some serious food for thought about the direction of the series moving forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>A few have tried to crack the extraction shooter nut that Escape From Tarkov has selfishly clung to like Scrat in Ice Age. Call of Duty’s MWZ barely laid a scratch. Gray Zone Warfare is great, but its numbers nosedived off a cliff, and Escape From Duckov is hilariously quite close in terms of popularity, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is something else. Wow.</p>



<p>The reception to ARC Raiders has been nothing but positive from testing to launch. It’s quite a rare feat, and Embark has caught lightning in a bottle with ARC Raiders. The developer is also achieving the difficult task of supporting the game well, adding the right content, and making changes befitting of the community. If you (the reader) say this is the biggest surprise hit of 2025, Insider Gaming would find it hard to argue.</p>



<p>Which leads nicely onto the conclusion of this article: What was your biggest surprise hit of 2025? Is there an easy winner or nomination left off of this list?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New data has revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 has already surpassed the lifetime sales of one of the Japanese gaming giant's previous pieces of hardware in the UK, as well as two other consoles from the annals of history.</p><p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2006017882128285792" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">analyst Chris Dring on X</a> (citing data from the analytics firm NielsenIQ), the Switch 2 has now passed the lifetime sales of the Wii U, which was released back in 2012 (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-cans-project-giant-robot-wii-u-production-ceases" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f5a85c7-dec2-4131-b5e3-122748abca15" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">discontinued in 2017</a>) in the UK.</p><p>Admittedly, the Wii U was largely considered to be a commercial failure, but the Switch 2 managing to surpass its entire sales total in the UK within just six months or so is still a fairly impressive achievement, even if the competition isn't particularly fair.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Ah, Wii U. We hardly knew, er, U.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Dring and NielsenIQ, the Switch 2 has also managed to pass the UK's lifetime sales total for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/days-of-playstation-vita-are-over" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4acfe571-2451-4f5a-a457-7180f86e895c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Vita</a> and the Sega Dreamcast, although, again, it's fair to say both of those machines were fairly ill-fated.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, though, fewer people bought those consoles across their entire life cycles than the Switch 2 in its first six months (in the UK, at least). Whether or not figures are similar across the world is hard to say, but I wouldn't be surprised if the picture is the same in the US and elsewhere.</p><p>Nintendo released the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in June this year</a>, and within the console's first two months on sale, it had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pass the six million sales mark</a>. Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its Switch 2 manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d44c0b0-340a-4585-9a19-51b01545f6f9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console</a> by March 2026.</p><p>Many popular games will be making their way to the Switch 2 in the coming months, too, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7fa2ba9-4e00-4f97-a4ff-d9244ef5b612" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, ghost-hunting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, and choice-based adventure title <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-switch-2-switch-eshop-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bcf2169-2693-40a4-ab6c-88b2398c75da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can nab a Nintendo Switch 2 for yourself via official channels right now. The same sadly can't be said for the Wii U, the Vita, or the Dreamcast, although I'm sure second-hand markets have their fair share of machines if you're interested.

              <p>….And we’re back. Sorry about last year. Our previous owners, G/O Media, were <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/">a pack of idiots</a> with more money than brains, who decided to stop anyone at <em>Kotaku</em> from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x">writing personal top ten lists</a>. Why? Pretty simple, really: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/07/03/go-media-jim-spanfeller-gawker-influence/">They had no idea what they were doing and nearly destroyed this place</a>. Anyway, they’re all gone now, and I’m still here. So let’s talk about my 10 favorite games of 2025!</p> <p>This 2025 list was an odd one to put together. I started with over 20 games that I played this year that I liked a lot. But whittling this list down to 10 was shockingly easy. Nothing felt like it had to be on here or screamed “Zack’s Favorite Game!” <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769">It was a year in which I played so many good games</a>, but few that stuck with me in the same way <em>Control</em> did in 2019, or<em> Half-Life: Alyx</em> the following year.</p>

 <p>I won’t waste any more time. You can go scroll to the list now and nod in agreement with some picks and shake your head at others.&nbsp; As usual, this list is in no particular order until the very end, where I’ll drop my personal favorite game of the year! (<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-robocop-alan-wake-2-best-games-2023-1851124842/3">And</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezen-s-top-10-games-of-2022-1849916027">here</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2021-1848267109">are</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2020-1845735344">my past</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2019-1840540510">lists</a>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, wait, one more thing: If you scroll <em>all</em> the way to the end, you’ll find my top 10 games of 2024. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/jim-spanfeller-is-a-herb-rise-fall-blog-post-deadspin.html">Take that, Jimbo</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><em><strong>Battlefield 6</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616054"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616054">EA / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, I wish EA’s big online FPS had some bigger maps. And, yup, there are still some vehicle balancing issues that need fixing. And, okay, sure, Redsec isn’t great, and the best thing I can say about the single-player campaign is that it’s short. But whatever, none of that has stopped me from investing nearly 150 hours into <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> since it launched in October. This is the kind of chaotic but tactical combat that I love in multiplayer games. The kind of online shooter where you can spend all night driving around in tanks and then the next day grab an SMG and clear rooms with your friends. And then a tank blows up the room you were in, and the building collapses, and you scramble outside into a nearby jeep and escape, only to be sniped by a bastard on the other side of the map. It’s <em>Battlefield</em>, baby, and I love it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Routine</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649265">©&nbsp;Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p>When I wrapped <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em>, a creepy photorealistic sci-fi horror game</a>, I liked it a lot, but I wasn’t convinced it would make my game of the year list. But then it did something not many games can do: It stuck with me. It has an incredibly oppressive and scary atmosphere that evolves in some interesting ways over the course of its runtime, before ramping up the horror to 11. And it does all of this while not being filled with cheap jump scares or bathtubs of blood. The fact that it’s all set it in mundane but incredibly realistic spaces, like kitchens and offices, just makes it all the easier to fully lose yourself in the experience. One scare in particular shook me up so bad that I’ll never forget it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Avowed</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000004852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000004852"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000004852">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I will forever be a sucker for big RPGs that let me wander aimlessly and discover new quests. Bethesda’s RPGs have been doing that for decades. <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em></a> smartly condenses the Bethesda formula while replacing some of that lost bloat with well-written companions and interesting hand-crafted sidequests. The end result is an RPG that lacks the simulation elements of <em>Skyrim</em> and the scale of <em>Fallout 4,</em> but features memorable characters and moments that stood out in a year filled with both.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>THPS 3+4</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001310">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>Few games feel as good as a well-made<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> title. And this year’s remake of <em>THPS 3 </em>and <em>THPS 4</em> is very well-made indeed. This is just a perfect little package of skateboarding shenanigans. Yes, I know people got mad about the open-world quests being removed from <em>THPS 4,</em> but I’ve always preferred the two-minute format for these classic <em>Tony Hawk</em> titles. Leave the big spaces and quests to <em>Underground</em> or <em>Wasteland</em>, y’know? That minor quibble aside, what Iron Galaxy created with <em>THPS 3+4</em> is marvelous. It looks like I remember those old games looking, plays fantastically, and features enough challenges and extra content to keep you grinding and flipping for many late nights. Now, someone convince Activision to remake <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground,</em> please.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Despelote</strong></em></h2> <figure><figcaption>© Panic</figcaption></figure> <p>I don’t care much for soccer. But I loved <em>Despelote</em>, a game that uses soccer as a throughline connecting different moments from a young boy’s life as he grows up in Quito during Ecuador’s qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This is a story about being a kid, dreaming big, getting into trouble, lying to your parents, growing up, and going back to where you once lived, only to find a much different place. You’ll be able to finish this one in a single extended sitting, and by the end, you’ll likely be won over by its storytelling, voice acting, visuals, and heart.</p> <h2><em><strong>Dispatch</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647392"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647392">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of Telltale narrative games (like <em>Wolf Among Us </em>and <em>The Walking Dead</em>) back in the day and enjoyed them, but I wasn’t sure if that formula would work again in 2025. I mean, I’m not sure it really worked back then either, but the writing was strong enough to win most folks over. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, a narrative-driven episodic game about a superhero agency, shows that with some tweaks and upgrades, the Telltale formula can still kick ass. Strong voice acting, a focus on narrative over fluff gameplay, and some truly funny moments help this strange workplace superhero comedy succeed in a way that, I’d argue, most Telltale games didn’t. Now, where’s season 2?</p> <h2><em><strong>Mafia: The Old Country</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655161">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p>When I sit down to play a game, I don’t always want to invest 400 hours into an RPG or grind away filling up meters or fight random people online. Sometimes, I just want a linear, 10-to-15-hour cinematic experience featuring solid gameplay and gorgeous visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is that kind of game</a>. The kind of game that we don’t get much of anymore. A big-budget AAA linear action adventure game that lacks crafting, RPG skill trees, or other guff. It’s just the classic mobster story of a dude who goes from nothing to everything, but it all costs him so much. Except this is set in 1904 Italy and ditches Tommy Guns and big cities for rolling fields and horses. The end result is beautiful.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>South of Midnight</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003790" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003790"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003790">© Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>If <em>South of Midnight’s</em> combat was better, it might have been able to slide into my top spot because everything else around the action-platformer is just that damn good.<em> South of Midnight</em> is a stop-motion-style adventure through a magical version of the South that deals head-on with topics like racism and slavery. But it also celebrates the unique culture that exists in the deep southern portion of the United States. And what screenshots of this game don’t reveal is that it’s packed with some of the best music of 2025, with songs that made me dance and others that made me cry. If you want to feel something, <a href="https://kotaku.com/south-of-midnight-game-pass-xbox-series-pc-south-review-1851775149">play <em>South of Midnight.</em></a></p> <h2><em><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000700"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000700">© Universal</figcaption></figure> <p>One night, while playing<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, I spent nearly three hours creating a massive paddock filled with various dinosaurs and a jeep tour. When I realized I had spent that much time on one part of the map, I felt a bit weird. Then I burned another hour while making that paddock look amazing and ensuring the adult and baby dinos inside were happy and healthy. A great game doesn’t have to tell some epic story or be filled with important themes and ideas. A great game can just take what came before it, expand on all of that, and then offer you a newly perfected prehistoric park builder that will suck away weeks of your life if you aren’t careful. This is one of the best simulation games around, and easily the best<em> Jurassic Park</em> game ever made.</p>

 <h2><strong>And my top game of 2025…<em>The </em></strong><em><strong>Outer Worlds 2</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639922">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I went back and forth on this a lot. I bet if you ask me in like two months what my top game of 2025 is, I might say something else. Truly, this was a strange year. But, I must admit that the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> (from <em>Avowed</em> studio Obsidian) was my game of the year.</p> <p>As someone who has put an embarrassing number of hours into<em> Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4</em>, I’m always craving an RPG that can provide similar experiences. The original <em>Outer Worlds</em> got close, but <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> finally nails and then improves on the open-ended FPS RPG action found in those past<em> Fallout</em> games. Gone are the stilted conversations from <em>Fallout</em> and the wonky combat and visuals. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> looks marvelous, feels like a joy to play, and still makes sure to include enough quirky moments and silly bits to satisfy any <em>Fallout</em> fan. Obsidian even included an in-game radio with ads and songs just like Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games.</p> <p>I can’t wait to come back to <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> in a few years, after forgetting most of it, and replay it as a new character. And to me, that’s the ultimate proof that a game has done something right. Now, one more thing…</p> <h2>Zack’s Top 10 Games Of 2024</h2> <ul> <li><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Silent Hill 2</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Helldivers 2</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Balatro&nbsp;</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Thank Goodness You’re Here</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong> Dungeons of Hinterberg</strong></em></li> <li><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong></a> – </em>My Favorite Game Of 2024!</li> </ul>

The game was first revealed back in 2023 at a Sony showcase, but since then, details have come in drips and drabs, with a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-trailer-shows-fresh-gameplay-but-its-still-without-a-release-date">Year of the Snake trailer shown at the start of this year</a>.</p>
<p>As for how it plays? Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">hands-on at Gamescom in 2024</a> and loved its fast and stylish combat, stressing that no, it is <em>not</em> a Soulslike.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a decade since we started to hear about <strong>Sleeping Dogs</strong>, the award-winning action-adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/sleeping-dogs-united-front-games-closed/">from the now-defunct United Front Games</a>, getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/donnie-yen-star-movie-adaptation-sleeping-dogs/">a film adaptation</a>. While for years, it seemed like the project, like the studio that made the original game, was dead in the water, Shang-Chi star <strong>Simu Liu</strong> has made it his personal mission to revive the film. Now, Liu has achieved a crucial step in that revival journey: by signing <strong>Timo Tjahjanto</strong> to be the film's director.</p>



<p>Liu and Tjahjanto both confirmed the news on <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/2005248175159050363">X (formerly Twitter)</a> with an exchange that began with a user asking Liu for an update on how the film is progressing. Liu pointed the user to Tjahjanto, who followed up with a gif from the game and the caption "<em>We'll cross the oceans of time to make this</em>."</p>



<p>Liu then responded with, "<em>Ladies and gents, the director of Sleeping Dogs</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's still unclear who will be penning the script, but it's good to see the film adaptation getting some momentum with Liu seemingly being the driving force behind any movement the film has. Liu is working on the film as a producer and will also ultimately star in it as Wei Shen, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sleeping-dogs-movie-still-on-donnie-yen/">essentially taking over the roles that the legendary Donnie Yen had all those years ago when we first heard of the adaptation</a>.</p>



<p>For his own part, <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/2005605017731178792">Tjahjanto added</a>, "<em>I’m excited to be developing SLEEPING DOGS with</em> <em>Simu Liu. We both are hungry and passionate about the material &amp; have plenty to prove. It's no secret that both TNCFU &amp; The Shadow Strays took inspiration from Sleeping Dogs, heck, I even based a character in TSS straight outta SD down to his name. This will take time, but we’ll make the best version out of it, Cleaver, chopsticks n' all.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, the film still has a long way to go before we can look forward to seeing it in theatres, but it's clear that Liu is not giving up on it any time soon. The more he puts the pieces of it together, the closer we are to seeing the film in theatres, and then hopefully, the closer we are to getting another Sleeping Dogs game.</p>



<p>After all, that's always been Liu's plan. "<em>First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone...that's always been the dream</em>," he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) at the beginning of 2025. </p>

			<p><strong>Shawn Layden</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-worldwide-studios-chairman-shawn-layden-to-depart-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retired</a> from his <span>position as Chairman of&nbsp;<strong>Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios</strong>, Sony's gaming division responsible for creating PlayStation exclusives, in 2019, after spending 32 years&nbsp;</span>at the company in various roles.</p>



<p>Since then, the former executive has often commented on industry-related topics. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-discless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the <strong>PlayStation 6</strong>, Sony's next console, is unlikely to be completely discless as the physical market is still a sizable one for the company.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Layden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwH_otOCDmQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a video interview</a> with YouTubers Naomi Kyle and Pause for Thought. During the 47-minute conversation, the executive admitted that the total install base of console users hasn't changed all that much in the past few generations, and proposed the creation of a 'consortium', like those used for the VHS, DVD, or Blu-ray, to create a <strong>unified gaming format</strong> that can then be licensed out.</p>



<p><em>We talk about gaming as being this $250 billion industry, which it is, and have hundreds of millions of users, which it does. But of course, that includes, if you're playing Wordle, you're a gamer. If you're playing Candy Crush, you're a gamer in that number. But the number of discrete consoles sold over any particular generation caps out at about 250 million. </em></p>



<p><em>If you line up all the PS1s, Sega Saturns, and N64s, and you go by generations, it's all about 250. The one time it popped to almost 300 was the generation that had the Wii, and people thought you could buy Wii Fit and lose weight. So, we got some non-traditional gaming audience to buy into the gaming industry at that time, but that was an anomaly and we've still flattened out. We need to crack that cap, that barrier. The only way we can do that is if, and I know people call me crazy and throw stones at me when I say this, but you know, Sony's Betamax format lost to VHS for one reason only: VHS licensed its format across many different manufacturers. </em></p>



<p><em>Sony held the unique Betamax patent trademark and everything. There was a license we did with Toshiba towards the end of the life cycle, but it never went wide like VHS and people didn't understand the need of having the same machine as your neighbor. You could have an RCA TV and you have a Sony TV and that's all fine. But once your neighbor has picked VHS and you want to watch that tape of that movie, but you have Betamax all of a sudden… So the industry coalesced around VHS. Then, later on, Sony and Philips created the compact disc consortium. They created the patent and then they licensed it out to all the other manufacturers. The same thing happened with DVD. The same thing happened with Blu-ray. They said that we'll compete on the device. So if you get a Bang &amp; Olufsen Blu-ray player, it's going to cost you more than the Sano version. Even though they'll both support the platform, but they'll have different bells and whistles. </em></p>



<p><em>I think we need to get in a world where we have a gaming format, and maybe it just comes from PC. Maybe we find a way just to do it all, you know, in a Linux kernel or something. And then we have a consortium around that. We have licensing programs which allow other manufacturers to build into that space and then you can talk about real numbers moving. That's how you get to the ubiquity of the toaster. But right now, I think we're kind of trapped in this containment field.</em></p>



<p>This is exactly the same problem that Microsoft has been shouting to the four winds for several years now, as it desperately reaches for the billions of potential gamers who could, in theory, be interested in games but have no intention of buying a specific console system. </p>



<p>Layden's vision also sounds pretty close to the single gaming platform ecosystem, which, personally, I've been advocating for several years. And yes, if it ever happened, it would have to be based on the PC. For Microsoft, it wouldn't be a big stretch, as they have already admitted they want to be everywhere the user is. Sony itself is also bringing its games to PC (albeit a bit late) and even to Xbox, as shown with Helldivers 2. The only major player in the console space that exclusively develops games for its own platform is Nintendo. </p>



<p>Their policy appears unlikely to change any time soon. Still, Layden's proposition is worth considering. Would you embrace such a change? Let us know below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gun-fu action game <em>Spine </em>was supposed to get a release date this year, but, as you've probably already noticed if you're following its progress, that didn't happen. Now, developer and publisher Nekki has taken to social media to explain why.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/playspine/status/2005664237407145990" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on X, Nekki acknowledges that they promised to reveal a release date for <em>Spine </em>this year, but that the team wasn't "ready" to announce a date or even a rough window.</p><p>Nekki says that since <em>Spine </em>is the team's first PC and console game, the project is "setting a new bar for quality, scope, and production values", and that the team's top priorities are <em>Spine</em>'s "product quality and...overall gameplay experience".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Spine </em>didn't get a release date this year, and developer Nekki has explained why.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nekki says that <em>Spine </em>is now "entering the final stages of development", and that the team is currently polishing the game's "content, locations, animations, voice acting, and interface". Developer diaries will continue between now and whenever <em>Spine</em>'s release date ends up being.</p><p>Sadly, you're not going to get that date today, either; Nekki says the team doesn't want to "name a release date [it isn't] fully confident in", but that you'll be hearing the date "in the near future". Expect more in the new year.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Spine</em>, Nekki describes it as "a single-player action game about close-quarters gunfights with aesthetics of Gun-Fu movies", so you can expect inspiration from the likes of <em>John Wick </em>and the <em>Matrix </em>movies, as well as games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4cdcb94-eb27-4726-bc08-ac26ee9ad89e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a><em> </em>and the tragically-dormant <em>Deus Ex </em>series.</p><p>The game casts you as "rebellious street artist Redline and her sentient combat implant Spine", and together, the two must battle an "autocratic AI regime". What else, after all, does one do in a cyberpunk setting?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-the-27%e2%80%b3-odyssey-gaming-monitor-to-black-friday-pricing-now-as-cheap-as-a-portable-monitor-2000656027</link>
            <guid>1394368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The big gift-giving holidays have come and gone. If you didn’t find the gaming monitor you were hoping for under the tree, then its time to take matters into your own hands. If you’re looking for a reliable display for gaming or general everyday use, the Samsung Odyssey G5 27-inch QHD monitor is an excellent option. Not only does it check all the key boxes for performance and visual quality, but right now, it’s also available at a significant discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6613/">Amazon is offering a 28% price cut, bringing the cost down from its usual price of $250 to just $180, saving you a full $70.</a></p>
<p>The 27-inch size of the Odyssey G5 offers the perfect balance between ample screen space and a size that doesn’t overwhelm your desk. The 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution delivers crisp and clear images. While 4K resolution would offer even more detail, it would also come with a much higher price tag for a barely noticeable difference at this screen size. The monitor also supports HDR, enhancing color vibrancy and ensuring that whites appear bright and clean, while shadows are rich and deep. With a fast 200Hz refresh rate, it provides smooth and fluid motion, and the inclusion of AMD FreeSync technology eliminates screen tearing, helping ensure that your visuals stay seamless.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-Time Reaction Speed</h2>
<p>What truly sets this monitor apart is its ultra-fast 1ms response time, making it incredibly responsive during fast-paced gameplay. This rapid response allows you to react instantly, which is crucial for gaming where split-second decisions can make all the difference. As someone who switched from console gaming to PC, I can personally attest to how much input lag affects gameplay. I didn’t realize just how much of an impact it had until I tried playing <em>Silksong</em> on my old 2017 TV and compared it to playing the same game on my gaming laptop. The difference was night and day. On the TV, the game felt sluggish and nearly unplayable, but on the laptop, combat and platforming were much more manageable.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 is incredibly versatile, offering compatibility with a wide range of devices. Whether you’re connecting a gaming PC, laptop, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or almost any other device, this monitor can handle it. It features two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort connection, giving you plenty of options to set up your ideal gaming or work station.</p>



<p>The stand on this monitor is also fully adjustable, allowing you to modify both the height and tilt. This ensures you can find the perfect viewing angle for maximum comfort, whether you’re working for hours or diving into extended gaming sessions. Your neck and back will definitely thank you after long periods of use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6613/">Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this monitor still provides great value, especially with the current 28% discount.</a> Whether you’re using it for gaming, work, or general multimedia, the Samsung Odyssey G5 is an excellent choice at just $180 for a limited time.</p>

              <p>Root through your drawers, and check that cardboard box in the attic: 3DS prices are going through the roof. As spotted by X account <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2005564455271490030">Pirat_Nation</a>, the old Nintendo handheld is now selling secondhand for as much as or more than they did at launch.</p> <p>The 3DS, originally released in 2010, was officially discontinued in 2020. A successor to the massively successful Nintendo DS, it matched its predecessor’s two-screen clamshell design, but this time with a stereoscopic 3D screen on the top half that didn’t require wearing magic glasses. It was, despite how you might remember things, a <em>phenomenal</em> success, selling a wild 75.94 million units across its ten years and various incarnations. Yet, despite this apparent ubiquity, demand for the devices is currently skyrocketing such that a used 3DS XL—which you could have picked up a year ago for under $100—can right now fetch you upward of $250.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">3DS Prices Are Spiking</p> <p>This Decade-Old Nintendo Handheld Is Now Worth Almost as Much as a Switch 2</p> <p>New 3DS XL models are often selling for $200 to $350 used.</p> <p>Prices are likely to keep climbing. <a href="https://t.co/s0SZJecvzM">pic.twitter.com/s0SZJecvzM</a></p> <p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2005564455271490030?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given the larger 3DS XL cost $200 on release (which itself was $50 cheaper than the original 3DS at launch), this is a massive price. It goes even higher if you’re looking for the so-called New Nintendo 3DS XL, the 2014 version of the handheld that added a new C-Stick and a better CPU, which you’ll struggle to pick up in good condition under $280. (If you scour eBay you might at first declare, “This idiot so-called ‘journalist’ has it all wrong!” until you look a bit closer and notice the lower prices will be for Japanese-only LL models, or listings that eventually reveal details about damaged LCD screens and the like.) It’s not entirely clear what’s driving this new interest; there hasn’t been a significant jump in piracy techniques since custom firmware superseded the need for flashcarts a few years back. Still,&nbsp;the 3DS remains an <em>amazing</em> gaming device.</p>

 <p>While the 3D effect was never something that really worked for me (with imperfect eyesight, it just looked blurry and unconvincing, and I’d inevitably just switch the effect off in every new game), it’s essentially a faster, bigger, and better Nintendo DS (the best console ever made, obviously), and is backwards compatible with the wonderful archive of DS games that preceded it. My 3DS XL sits proudly on the shelves behind me, secure in the knowledge that I’ll never sell it (well, unless prices spike an <em>awful</em> lot more), a copy of <em>Pokémon Ultra Moon</em> in the cart slot as nature intended. But it’s tempting!</p>

              <p>Will <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> be a PlayStation 7 game? Is <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> really going to be playable on Switch 2 next year? And why is Logan Paul so good at making everything he talks about, including Pokémon cards, sound so sleazy? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Ex-Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Shawn Layden is apparently pitching <a href="https://gamerant.com/shawn-layden-playstation-new-project/">a <em>Mad Men-</em>style show</a> about game development. It will probably never get made but I would definitely watch the hell out of that. Bobby Kotick could play Bobby Kotick, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/h0fo5r/in_moneyball_2011_bobby_kotick_the_ceo_of/">again</a>. For now, <em>Mythic Quest</em> remains a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/105byyf/are_we_apologizing_for_the_nazis_or_on_their/">pretty great parody</a> of the video game industry.</p>

 <h2>Logan Paul sounds desperate to sell his $5.3 million Pikachu</h2>   <p>“Pokemon as an asset class has outperformed the stock market by upwards of 3,000 percent in the last 20 years.” That’s how the online content hustler recently hyped up the upcoming auction for his PSA 10 Illustrator Pikachu card, which he claims is the most valuable Pokémon card in the world, during a segment on Fox Business.</p>

 <p>Prior to promoting the upcoming auction, Paul <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">had been wearing</a> the nearly $6 million piece of paper around his neck during wrestling matches. If anyone can pop the insane bubble around Pokémon cards coming out of the covid-era lockdown, it’s the guy who, just a couple of years ago, had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787">refund fans</a> for his failed NFT game.</p>

 <h2>Could <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> be the next big Switch 2 port we see in 2026?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">Data mining of the recent Title 4 Update</a> hints that development might currently be underway on a Switch 2 version. Considering <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Pragmata</em> are also coming to the new console, that’s not completely unexpected; Capcom has been supporting Switch 2 in a big way, though <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ performance struggles on PC and console don’t instill a ton of confidence about how it might fare on the weaker platform.</p>

 <p>It might not be the only big new third-party port we see next year, either. Leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://imgur.com/YnfBIbY">reports</a> that a rumored ongoing shortage around Switch 2 dev kits has “largely been resolved.”</p> <h2>When will we see <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Polish analytics firm Noble Securitie <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">predicts</a> it could arrive as early as 2030 with a budget of roughly $420 million. That seems to wildly overestimate the speed and efficiency of modern AAA development. My own guess is we don’t see it until 2032 and it costs over half a billion before marketing.</p>

 <h2>Zack Snyder is a fan of the Kim Kardashian skin in <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Justice League</em> director recently wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS1aM6VEd1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=fea529be-5c29-42dd-90ce-d2129577d360">Instagram</a>, “Big thanks to @kimkardashian for carrying me to all those Royales on @fortnite over Christmas break.” The Kardashian cosmetic is <a href="https://kotaku.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-skin-item-shop-most-used-2000655163">reportedly</a> the most popular skin in all of season 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Front Missions 3: Remake</em> is right around the corner and has a free demo</h2> <p>The overhaul of the tactical mech RPG classic for PS1 arrives on January 30 and recently got a free demo for fans to try. Unfortunately, the<em> Front Mission</em> series remakes have been some of the worst around, and I’m not holding my breath that <em>Front Mission 3</em> will reverse the trend. <a href="https://x.com/senhorcorvo/status/2003901159921360908">Early reports</a> from the demo are that the game still rocks but it feels like it was thrown together on a shoestring budget.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-chinese-rpg-sword-fairy-trailer-remake-2000655947">Fans debate<em> Clair Obscur</em> becoming the new “Boss Baby Vibes” meme</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988">In-development footage shows the version of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> we didn’t get</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Cops know <em>GTA 5</em> voice actor by name because he’s been swatted so many times</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>When the U.S. gambling laws <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23561576/chalk-line-how-got-legalized-sports-betting">loosened in 2018</a>, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23561576/chalk-line-how-got-legalized-sports-betting">many and various ways it would destroy people’s lives</a> were widely predicted. It wasn’t hard to guess: you just had to look at every other country where it was allowed, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mp0dp71ryo">not least the UK</a>. But perhaps few would have bet on (sorry) this resulting in a situation seven years later where bots were making small fortunes betting on online video games. One such bot, named TeemuTeemuTeemu, has made $230,000 in just five months gambling via Polymarket on games like <em>Counter-Strike</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bot made $900 -&gt; $208k in 3 months on polymarket</p> <p>one of the most talked about bots on polymarket right now<br>farmed $208,521 pure profit in a quarter</p> <p>focus exclusively on esports<br>mainly LoL and Dota 2</p> <p>bot monitors live game<br>parses stream and official data faster than market… <a href="https://t.co/YTueu8U3Dm">pic.twitter.com/YTueu8U3Dm</a></p> <p>— Archive (@ArchiveExplorer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveExplorer/status/2005688246815146183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As noticed by X user ArchiveExplorer, the bot has made the majority of this money in the last three months, making observations of live games faster than any human could, and getting its bets in before the market can react to events in games. As such, it’s able to get bets in at far lower or higher odds than humans trying to react to in-game kills or objectives, and thus to game the market for maximum profit.</p>

 <p>Scrolling through <a href="https://polymarket.com/@TeemuTeemuTeemu">the bot’s history of bets</a>, it wins far more often than it loses, putting fairly large sums (routinely between $200 and $20,000) on very marginal improvements, bringing in modest wins of a few bucks up to around $1500. But it does this a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>—1,127 times over the months—with its biggest win being $89.3k in one bet.</p>

 <h2>You’ll never guess who let this happen</h2> <p>Of course, using bots to predict markets and make <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12827752">light-speed decisions</a> isn’t anything new when it comes to gambling. That’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low_latency_direct_market_access">how the stock markets have worked</a> for years. Given the recent rise of Polymarket, a crypto-scam-based prediction market where anyone can place bets on pretty much anything, it’s inevitable that it will eventually be entirely dominated by bots and algorithms, racing to be the fastest and most precise.</p>

 <p>Polymarket’s recent success is largely down to the Trump administration’s relaxing of regulations surrounding such an enterprise, driven—you’ll be astonished to learn—by a desire to allow Trump’s farcical Truth Social platform to offer the same sort of prediction gambling. Announced a couple of months ago, Truth Predict is the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group’s attempt, in partnership with Crypto.com, to muscle in on the market. Fun fact: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485594b3-5a72-4ae1-aa93-8ee987be1569">according to the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, Crypto.com donated $11 million to “Trump causes,” shortly followed by the closing of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the company.</p>

 <p>Oh, and guess what! Donald Trump Jr. sits on the board of Polymarket! It so happens that back in July, investigations into whether Polymarket had been acting illegally were dropped by Trump’s government, after the company had previously stopped operating in the U.S. when the Biden administration suggested it might be running “an illegal exchange.”</p>

 <p>Quick aside: any small part of the above would have been enough to end a presidency at any previous point in history. Now, this is just one of many, many schemes, scams, and grifts the current president is running, out in the open, with no consequences at all.</p>

 <p>La la la, everything’s fine, do bee do bee doo, ArchiveExplorer suggests there’s now a lot of competition to build similar and faster bots than TeemuTeemuTeemu, all designed to exploit the ways in which games like&nbsp;<em>Dota</em> and&nbsp;<em>LoL</em> are competitively played. Money isn’t real, capitalism is a grift, and <a href="https://frac.org/hunger-poverty-america">47.4 million Americans live with food insecurity</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Will Hytale Be On Steam? How To Buy Hytale, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-steam-how-to-buy-hytale/</link>
            <guid>1394320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will be one of 2026’s most in-demand early access games, and buying it will be a priority for lovers of sandbox and casual games, with the odd deadly monster here and there. You’d think Hytale being on Steam would be a guarantee, but the only guarantee in life is that there are no guarantees.</p>



<p>A new year normally gets off to a slow start. January 2026 doesn’t have a plethora of huge titles, but there’s one that catches the eye—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a>. The resurrected and rejuvenated project is back on track, and Hypixel Studios is working hard to deliver the most complete game over the next few years.</p>



<p>If you want to buy it and support it, knowing if it’s on Steam will be a huge help.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-hytale-on-steam">Can You Buy Hytale On Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flamingo? Bingo. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale will not be available to purchase from Steam once it launches into early access in January 2026.</strong></p>



<p>‘But this would help Hytale succeed and bring more attention, surely?’ If this is your sentiment, it’s correct. But if you’re wondering why Hypixel Studios has made the call to skip Steam, there’s a very clear and respectful reason:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No, not initially. We want to spend our time in Early Access working with our existing community to improve the game, rather than chasing a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction. We don’t shy away from honest, negative criticism; we have been very critical of the state of the game ourselves on social media. We simply want the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game’s development background.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, Hytale will be on Steam at some point, but only once the developer feels comfortable that the game is in a good-enough state to be purchased and reviewed on the platform. Negative reviews or review bombing can be destructive for any game, so this move makes a lot of sense and should be respected.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-purchase-hytale">How To Purchase Hytale</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Intruder. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The only way to buy Hytale right now is to make an account through the game’s website, verify your details, and complete the purchase.</strong></p>



<p>Check out these quick and handy instructions if you want to buy Hytale now:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://hytale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale</a> website.</li>



<li>Click one of the <strong>Pre-Purchase</strong> buttons.</li>



<li>Choose the edition you want, and click <strong>Pre-Purchase</strong> underneath it.</li>



<li>Create an account and verify it.</li>



<li>Accept the <strong>I Understand</strong> prompt for the Pre-Purchase notice.</li>



<li>Complete your Hytale order.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, you can download Hytale early access close to launch and start playing once it’s live.</li>
</ol>



<p>You’ll be met with this message before you continue with the purchase, just as a warning:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This version represents the core of the game while development continues. Features will grow, evolve, and sometimes change direction based on your feedback. You may encounter bugs, unfinished content, or occasional instability, and saved games may need to be reset as we update systems. If you’re looking for the full experience, we recommend waiting for a later release; but if you’d like to help shape Hytale’s future, we’d love to have you with us.”</p>
</blockquote>

                <p dir="ltr">Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend.</p><p dir="ltr">Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first arrive in Kaso-Machi and take on stewardship of the mascot agency, your primary goal is to drive better foot traffic to the formerly popular tourist destinations around town. Due to the dwindling economic status of the island, most of the people who have survived its trials and tribulations have moved on from it. All that's left behind are pockets of increasingly poorer people who are either too proud to leave or simply stuck. The economy needs a shot in the arm, and so it falls on you as Michi--who has been cast out from the yakuza for a job gone wrong--to send in mascots to the few businesses still operating, drum up interest, and invest your earnings into other ventures and mascots around Kaso-Machi.</p><p dir="ltr">Progress is slow but steady. Before you know it, districts that once seemed destined to fade into nothingness begin displaying faint signs of life again. A long-dormant festival is resurrected and, with time, this energy ripples outward to the rest of the island. The largely abandoned train station in the heart of town, which is presided over by a charming man and his cat-with-a-hat, is brought back from the brink of redundancy. A few towns over from Kaso-Machi's central hub, you revive an arcade. As the cultural centers and infrastructure of Kaso-Machi are resurrected, life in the reportedly cursed isle begins to flourish once more, and its residents invest that good will and energy back into you, the catalyst for this change.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623273"></a><figcaption>Pinky isn't the only weirdo you help out across Kaso-Machi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sure, what I'm describing is a fairly standard upgrade system, but something about the way Promise Mascot Agency conveys them makes it stand above its peers. The "power-ups" gifted to Michi and Pinky aren't really the kind of skills that the player can then turn around and use for their own benefit like a standard skill tree or progression system. For example, you get a turbo upgrade for your truck, but it doesn't benefit you alone to use it. There are no races in Promise Mascot Agency, though a post-launch update did add time trials. It is, however, useful in getting you, and whomever you're carrying, to your destination more quickly and continuing to help and delegate tasks around the island. The same goes for the eventual boat and flying upgrades you gain as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Promise Mascot Agency follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The cannon upgrade you receive partway through Promise Mascot Agency almost appears like the moment the game might introduce some kind of vehicular combat. Instead, you use it to launch Pinky, Promise Mascot Agency's sociopathic companion character, at piles of trash, since one of the side-activities you're invited to take part in is to clear Kaso-machi's abundance of garbage You can additionally fire her at reelection signs for the corrupt mayor, whom Pinky winds up running against in the game's final act! Otherwise, the cannon is almost comically useless: It will just launch Pinky straight up into the sky to the benefit of no one at all.</p><p dir="ltr">It is kind of funny how mundane Promise Mascot Agency turns out to be. It's a lot like the Yakuza games in that sense, which feature no shortage of oddball characters on sometimes incomprehensible journeys that often resolve themselves in deeply humane, relatable, and sometimes abjectly dull ways. It is a perspective on the human condition I resonate with on a profound level, and it is one I was so happy to find beneath the surface of Promise Mascot Agency. It's why I reveled in the simplistic motivations of its cast, and why I found myself entranced by the busywork they constantly dropped on me, as well as the mission of bettering the lives of everyone in Kaso-Machi. Of building a community that could withstand the corruption of local governance, overcome its grisly and tragic past, and forge a brighter future together.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the community-building the player spends the game toiling away at--all the garbage you clean, signs you take down, and businesses you bring back to Kaso-Machi--comes to a head in the game’s rousing finale. To make a complicated matter short, the continued existence of your agency, which has provided a home to mascots, economic stability to the island, and exposed local corruption, is being threatened. The only way to assure it continues is to win a national competition that is, as becomes obvious, rigged against you.</p><p dir="ltr">You lose, and you lose quite badly. But at Michi's lowest point, he retreats to a mind palace of sorts (Pinky dubs it a "metaphysical nightmare") and comes face to face with everyone he's helped--that you, the player, have helped. Every mascot we employed, every business owner we aided, every teenage thug we straightened out, and even members of the yakuza family that had tossed us out appeared to Michi. An island's worth of friendly faces propped us up, dusted us off, and reminded us that we weren't alone.</p><p>The end of the game plays out like a gauntlet of Promise Mascot Agency's card-based minigame. Only, by the game's end, all of your allies' support cards have been consolidated into a handful of overpowered ones that wipe out any threat with a single play. And as I cruised to Promise Mascot Agency's end on the back of the community that I'd spent 20+ hours building and fortifying, I couldn't help but think that of course the strongest power of them all was the power of friendship. Who would've thought that I'd find one of the richest examples of community in one of the most bizarre games about driving a human-sized, sentient (and not to mention, homicidal) thumb around town?</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="476">If you’ve ever wanted a device that’s easier to handle than a full-sized tablet but still larger and more capable than your phone, the iPad Mini fits perfectly into that sweet spot.

This feature is especially useful for video calls on FaceTime, Zoom, or other conferencing apps, as it automatically keeps you centered in the frame—even if you move around or someone else joins you in view. On the back, the 12MP camera supports 4K video recording and makes scanning documents quick and easy.</p>
