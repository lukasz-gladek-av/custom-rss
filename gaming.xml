			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> brought back one of its most beloved franchises from the seventh generation of consoles with the return of <strong>Skate</strong>. It was absolutely not the <strong>Skate 4</strong> that fans of the series had hoped they might get one day. It was EA's attempt at turning the franchise into a live service game that could churn out cash for the publisher, and despite it being the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/top-3-best-selling-aaa-pc-console-games-all-ea-games-battlefield-6-ea-fc-25-ea-fc-26/">most-downloaded free-to-play PC and console game</a></strong> in 2025 according to a new Sensor Tower report, less than six months from its launch, developer <strong>Full Circle</strong> has been impacted by <strong>layoffs</strong>.</p>



<p>A statement from the studio on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">official website</a> announced the cuts, though in the standard style of these kinds of announcements, it does not specify how many developers were impacted or provide any real clarity behind the decision to make these cuts. </p>



<p>"<em>Since launching Early Access in September, tens of millions of you have stepped into San Vansterdam</em>," the statement begins. "<em>Your passion, creativity, and feedback have reinforced our belief in what skate. can become. As skate. continues to evolve, we’re transforming as a studio. We’re reshaping Full Circle to better support skate.’s long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most to you - and making those things great</em>."</p>



<p>"<em><strong>These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted.</strong> The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>EA was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-spent-most-on-ads-2025-ea-biggest-publisher-game-downloads-pc-console-ps5-xbox-steam/">biggest publisher by game downloads in the PC and console space last year</a>. It had all three of the top-selling AAA PC and console games in its portfolio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/"><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> </a>ahead of everything else in a year when shooters and action games were the most popular genres. </p>



<p>While it's always a bit mind-boggling to see major publishers lay off developers while they're having a strong commercial year, one likely factor in this instance of it is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">not-yet-official <strong>buyout of EA</strong> by the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong></a>. The <strong>$20B</strong> of debt EA will take on as part of the deal, should it go through, has been identified by several analysts as <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">a "<em>ticking time bomb</em>" for layoffs</a>, and this could just be the first of many to come from EA this year in preparation and anticipation of the deal going through.</p>



<p>Which is not yet a guarantee, as it still has to get approval from several global regulatory bodies, including the US's <strong>FTC</strong>. Members of Congress in the States have <a href="https://wccftech.com/46-congress-members-express-serious-concerns-over-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout-ftc/">already petitioned the FTC to take extra care when scrutinizing this deal,</a> and it'll be interesting to see whether the FTC tries to fight it like it did <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-us-federal-trade-commission-v-microsoft-over-the-activision-blizzard-deal-has-come-to-an-end-the-ftc-officially-drops-the-case/">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</a></strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Reactive Medieval Fantasy World” Valorborn From Laps Games Arrives in Early Access in April 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valorborn-release-date-early-access-medieval-fantasy-rpg-laps-games/</link>
            <guid>1446334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Valorborn</strong>, the upcoming open-world sandbox RPG that developer <strong>Laps Games</strong> describes as a "<em>dangerous, reactive medieval fantasy world full of freedom, tension, and possibility</em>," officially has an early access release date. It'll arrive on PC first through Steam, and it'll be out in early access on <strong>April 15, 2026.</strong> </p>



<p>Sim and city-building fans may already recognize Laps Games as the developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1981570/Land_of_the_Vikings/">Land of the Vikings</a></strong>, the 2023 strategy city-building sim that lets you create intricate Viking colonies and challenges you to lead your people through difficult winters, military expeditions, all while managing resources so your colony can thrive instead of just getting by.</p>



<p>Valorborn zooms its focus in on your individual character rather than an entire colony, with emergent storytelling that evolves depending on where you choose to explore. It's a world that'll continue to grow and evolve with or without you, with villagers in their routines, different factions constantly vying for power on their own clock, and a shifting world that may seem safe when you leave it only for its most dangerous elements to be right on your doorstep when you return.</p>



<p>When it arrives in early access, you'll be able to start your journey in <strong>Thareon</strong>, the first major kingdom you'll be able to explore. Thareon is one of several kingdoms that were part of the <strong>Allarion Empire</strong>, with your journey kicking off just after the fall of the Allarion Empire. More kingdoms within the fallen empire will be made available as the game continues to grow and develop, and each will bring its own unique quirks and customs, like how the worst crime you can commit in Thareon is practicing magic. A significant contradiction to the fact that magic was once a significant part of Allarion, and remains a significant force in the world.</p>



<p>Because Valorborn is a game that moves on even when you're not playing, with you driving your own path, one of its more significant elements is <strong>permadeath</strong>. Laps Games calls it a <strong>core feature</strong> in the game's design, forcing you to think very carefully about how you move through the world, whether you've chosen to be a sword-for-hire, a thief, a hunter, a lone traveler or a member of a larger party.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Valorborn</em>&nbsp;is an ambitious project for us, and it was made possible by the support we received for&nbsp;<em>Land of the Vikings</em>," said Laps Games founder <strong>Onurhan Akçay,</strong> in a press release. "<em>That support gave us the foundation to build something bigger and more systemic. With&nbsp;Valorborn</em>, <em>we wanted to create a world where players can truly choose their own path and write their own stories. A lot of our inspiration comes from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">Mount &amp; Blade</a>,&nbsp;Wartales, and&nbsp;Kenshi, and from worlds like&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">The Lord</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">of the Rings</a>. Those inspirations helped shape the kind of experience we wanted to make, a dangerous, reactive medieval fantasy world full of freedom, tension, and possibility.</em>"</p>

<p>Laps Games also says that <em>Valorborn</em>'s world will be fully realized, which means that "every building, cave, and point of interest is fully enterable" and there will be "no fake doors or decorative entrances".</p><p>You'll be able to choose on what level you want to engage with <em>Valorborn</em>. Will you be a sellsword, fighting off threats for coin? Perhaps you'll take the role of a hunter, living off the land and eschewing the benefits of civilization.</p><p>Whatever you choose to be, you'll be able to take on <em>Valorborn </em>alone or assemble a party to experience the game's world with you. Bear in mind, though, that this is very much a single-player project, so you won't be able to play alongside your friends.</p><p>According to Laps Games, permadeath will be "a core part of the experience" in <em>Valorborn</em>, but setbacks are intended to be "part of each player's story rather than a dead end".</p>
<p>Over the course of <em>Valorborn</em>'s time in Early Access, you can expect more kingdoms to explore, more starting options for new journeys, and "more ways for adventurers to define their own origin".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372530/Valorborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 15th.

              <p>Another AA publisher is hanging on for dear life. Amazon continues to flee AAA gaming like it didn’t just make $77 billion in net income last year. And a $20 million fine on Reddit shows why the scourge of online age-verification requirements has become such a messy fight. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Were you waiting for the right time to check out <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>? It was a lot of fun and <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432">is about to get new DLC</a>.</p> <p>I’m still trying to read the finely crumbled tea leaves in the new CEO of Xbox’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">first big interview since taking over</a>. She promises AI won’t displace creativity and that nothing is off the table in terms of a rethink. But she’s also waiting to complete a listening tour before deciding what to change. Matt Booty, meanwhile, promises first-party development remains a key pillar of Microsoft Gaming, including small indie games like Double Fine’s <em>Keeper</em>. Only one thing is for certain: Xbox’s Major Nelson is <a href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/2026423036908618209">ready to report back for duty</a>.</p>

 <h2>Nacon has some overdue bills</h2> <p>The French publisher announced it doesn’t currently have enough cash to pay its debts, leading it to file for insolvency, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nacon-files-for-insolvency-says-its-assessing-all-possible-solutions-to-continue-running/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. It says the “procedure will enable the company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” It recently released the underwhelming <i>Styx: Blades of Greed</i> and is preparing for the launch of the troubled RPG sequel <em>Greedfall 2</em> in March.</p> <p>Last year it published <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a grim but novel Soulslike that received a fair amount of praise but not much wider attention. It follows an AWOL military operative searching for his family in a war-torn country infested with supernatural beings. Unlike most modern games, it eschewed clear objectives and quest markers, which some found refreshing and others found tedious.</p>

 <p>Nacon was also set to publish <i>Terminator: Survivors</i> last year but the game was unexpectedly delayed indefinitely. The survival shooter also dropped its plans for Early Access and multiplayer co-op.</p> <h2>Amazon abandon’s <em>Forza Horizon</em> director’s new open-world game</h2> <p>UK developer Maverick Games is no longer working with Amazon, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. The studio was cofounded in 2022 by former <em>Forza Horizon</em> creative director Mike Brown to make a AAA narrative-led game, with the tech giant signed on to publish. It’s unclear what will happen if the team doesn’t find a new partner. “Development of our debut title continues to progress as strongly as planned,” Maverick Games said. “We’re in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

 <h2>Xbox cloud gaming gets an upgrade on console</h2> <p>“We’re now rolling out up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members, delivering sharper visuals and more responsive gameplay across supported titles and regions,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/february-xbox-update-1440p-streaming-rog-xbox-ally-updates-and-more/">new post on Xbox Wire</a>. A bunch of updates have also been rolled out to the Xbox PC gaming app to make navigation feel more responsive.</p> <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> lawsuit gets dismissed</h2> <p>Filed earlier this year, it accused Hasbro executives of misleading investors about the sustainability of the card game’s profits and alleged that overprinting was happening despite the known harm it would do to the brand. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-hasbro-2026-lawsuit-magic-card-overproduction/"><em>Polygon</em> reports</a> it was voluntarily withdrawn while another shareholder lawsuit continues. Hasbro previously said the claims had no merit.</p>

 <h2>Reddit gets fined nearly $20 million over child privacy issues</h2> <p>UK regulators said the company shirked its responsibility to know which of its users were 13 or younger and handle any personal information collected accordingly (via <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx0xggepjo">the <em>BBC</em></a>). It’s one of the regulatory pressures leading companies like Reddit, Discord, and others to implement AI age checks which are in turn making users mad. “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety,” a spokesperson for Reddit said. The company will appeal the ruling.</p> <h2>20 years later, modders are still trying to “fix” <em>Morrowind</em></h2> <p>A great new feature at <em>Ars Technica</em> details the long-running efforts of <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to make <em>Morrowind</em>‘s world feel as vast as that of its predecessor, <em>Daggerfall</em>. The result is multiple groups of modders spanning decades working together to try and piece together all of Tamriel in the 2002 PC game.</p> <p>“We have some really wonderful people who are the old guard that feel like they are the comfortable welders, and they’re all very wise,” college-age modder Meadhainnigh said. “But even in the newest editions, we’re not here because we think that it’s all going to be done within our lifetimes. We like to joke about 2090 and about raising our children to work on the project. We just like to look at the next release, and that tends to be exciting enough to get us going.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339">This boomer shooter bundle for charity is the best gaming deal of the week</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341">A new worst game of 2026 has arrive and it’s a Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309">Discord delays its age-verification rollout but blames the backlash on people misunderstanding the details</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-supergiant-narrative-interview-ending-changes/</link>
            <guid>1446295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After a <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions/"><u>fittingly shifting</u></a> early access period, <em>Hades 2</em> released last fall to largely raucous applause. But there was one sticking point – or rather, a handful that coalesced into a larger whole like <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-pet-the-dog/"><u>our dear good boy Cerberus</u></a>: the narrative, previously incomplete, built to a conclusion that to some <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hades-2-ending-explained-chronos-zagreus-melinoe-epilogue/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>felt unsatisfying</u></a>. So Supergiant patched it in an effort to provide greater closure for all involved. The decision, says creative director Greg Kasavin, was a no-brainer despite coming <em>after </em>the early access period rather than during, but he’s also made his peace with the fact that not everybody’s on board with where the game’s larger-than-life tale of gods, titans, and fates ultimately ended up.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Spoilers for Hades 2 follow.</em></p><p><em>Hades 2</em>’s ending presented players with a plethora of potential quibbles, but many found themselves inconsolably at odds with the fact that Zagreus, main character Melinoë’s brother and hero of <em>Hades 1</em>, as opposed to Melinoë herself, made the extremely consequential decision to show compassion to a past version of <em>Hades 2</em>’s central villain, Chronos, thus forcing Melinoë to abandon her lifelong mission of scattering the conniving titan to the sands of time in favor of bonding with a suddenly remorseful version of him. This, in some players’ minds, did not feel true to Melinoë’s character, stealing agency from her and robbing her of retribution following a lifetime of injustice. The updated version allowed Melinoë to make that call herself and dropped in additional scenes supporting it, showing rather than telling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At DICE in Las Vegas earlier this month, Kasavin explained that the eleventh hour decision to reconfigure an ending years in the making – a rarity for narrative-driven games despite high-profile instances like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_ending_controversy?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s controversial ending overhaul</u></a> – came after only a small amount of consternation.&nbsp;</p><p>"I mean, of course if all of us had perfect foresight, we would make all sorts of decisions differently throughout life, but none of us are so fortunate,” Kasavin told Aftermath when asked if he had any regrets stemming from the original version of<em> Hades 2</em>’s ending. “[But] when you're making an early access game, it's almost like you've created a contract with you and your players. We're working in partnership with our players and we're taking their feedback and synthesizing it as part of what we want to accomplish and make something that is true to our vision while also hopefully being as satisfying as possible to our player base. The decision about the ending, in many respects, was very straightforward because it was simply the same process we've used all throughout: We get feedback, we consider it, and then we ask ourselves 'Is there something we can do to address it?' It just so happened that this related to a part of the story, and it was after version 1.0 rather than before."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tweaking the ending, then, felt natural, especially considering who much of the criticism was coming from.</p><p>"We made the decision [to change the ending] really quickly,” Kasavin said. “We knew that we wanted to do something because we knew players had really high expectations – particularly our early access players, who played a lot of the first game and also this game in early access. They had good feedback, as they did all throughout early access."</p><p>Reactions to the 2.0 version of <em>Hades 2</em> 1.0’s ending have been <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hades/i-was-one-of-the-first-to-see-hades-2s-true-ending-and-i-dont-know-how-i-feel-about-supergiant-retconning-the-whole-thing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mixed</u></a>. Some feel that Supergiant’s effort to fill in blanks helps sell a once-rushed face turn, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1outvpc/comparing_the_newold_endings_analyzing/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">fleshing out multiple characters</a> en route to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hades-2-ending-update-melinoe-zagreus-switch-2/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a legitimately heartwarming finale</u></a>. But much ink was spilled before and after the patch about larger narrative issues, especially in terms of Melinoë’s<a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending/"><u> inability to budge a Sisyphean status quo</u></a> that Zagreus at least made a (or several hundred) run(s) at marginally improving. The game’s cast, as a result, winds up feeling static – bland, even. There’s also the matter of <em>Hades 2</em>’s grander endgame ambitions: a reckoning with the idea of fate itself that catches gods and mortals alike in its sweeping net while shunting Melinoë’s more personal concerns off to the side. As <a href="https://defector.com/hades-ii-is-at-war-with-itself?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Defector pointed out</u></a>, <em>Hades 2</em> is ultimately at odds with its own structure, attempting to depict seismic change within a framework of necessary repetition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kasavin has heard the criticisms and, indeed, sought them out. But when it comes to engaging with articles, videos, and comments directly, he prefers to let the game do the talking.</p><p>“We welcome criticism of our work and read all of it that we can find,” Kasavin said. “We feel our work ultimately needs to speak for itself. If nothing else, discussions around the themes, characters, and broader differences between the two games suggest to us that players are engaging with the work, which is great.”</p><p>Kasavin also recognizes that the original <em>Hades</em>, a record-breaking roguelite that has spawned countless imitators, was always going to be a tough act to follow – even for himself, the guy who directed it.</p><p>"We didn't have a lot of room to make something where people would be like 'Oh wow, that just blew the previous game out of the water,' because [the original] <em>Hades </em>won more than 70 game of the year awards and exceeded our wildest expectations,” he said. “We wanted to make something that was on the level and had its own distinct identity – that could assert itself. We knew that players would compare and contrast. They would contrast Melinoë to Zagreus."</p><p>"For some people, [<em>Hades 2</em>] lands really well,” he added. “For other people, their memory of the original is so strong that it may not pass it, and that's all OK. ... We've been fortunate to have worked on games that, one after another, have been able to strike a chord with people at their own point in time. We have never endeavored to tell our players that a game will be better than the last one, because if you got a tattoo of <em>Hades</em>, who are we to tell you that this game is going to be even better than that? You're at a different point in time; you have different expectations, and we try not to pressure ourselves into making something that would be better for everyone in that way. But of course, we don't want to disappoint people either."</p><p>So of course, Supergiant’s next project is going to be a sequel to its real best game, <em>Pyre</em>, right?</p><p>"Who knows?" Kasavin replied with a laugh. "We have no idea right now. We never even begin to think about what our next game is until the dust has settled on the one that we've been working on. How we feel at the end of that process is really important to where we go next."</p><p>Ideally, though, Supergiant’s core crew – who’ve been together since the beginning, practically a miracle in the modern video game industry – will figure it out together.</p><p>"Our ambitions, such as they are, are simply to be able to make another game after the one that we work on," said Kasavin. "We like working together. We think that the creative chemistry we have is why our games have been well received. Each of us have experienced our greatest successes working together. So we have all reasoned that we are greater than the sum of our parts. Supergiant is more than 25 people now, but we're on the relatively smaller side for a studio that's been around 15 [or] 16 years. A goal of ours is just to be able to keep doing this for the long haul. It doesn't mean it will happen; people go through their different life changes. But we as a team try to do the best we can to support one another and keep doing what we're doing because we love it. We wish we could do it forever."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending/"><div><p>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo - Aftermath</p><p>Melinoë’s journey is more about acceptance than change</p><p><span>Jay Castello</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-two-masters-dlc-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1446280</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the best <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/"><strong>action games</strong> of 2025</a> and the return of one of the best action series in video games last year, <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, will get its first major <strong>DLC</strong> release <strong>next week</strong>, with the arrival of its previously announced <strong>The Two Masters</strong> DLC on <strong>March 4, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>The confirmation of its release date comes after we previously learned that the DLC would arrive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/">sometime in early 2026.</a> Announced in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/ninja-gaiden-4-the-two-masters-dlc-release-date/">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, we also got a new look at gameplay from the DLC, which adds two new weapons (one for Ryu and one for Yakumo), three new chapters, and plenty of new enemies to slice through.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - 'The Two Masters' Release Date Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k91_EndqCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>This story-driven expansion continues Yakumo and Ryu’s battle against fiends that once again threaten to take over the world</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>&nbsp;After completing the main story, players will unlock new story chapters that push both characters into battles against even deadlier enemies, challenging bosses, and new trials that will test the skills of even the most seasoned master ninja.</em>"</p>



<p>Ryu is getting a new <strong>Jakotsumon</strong> serpent gauntlets as his new weapon, while Yakumo will be able to wield a new <strong>Solitaire</strong> scythe. You'll be able to test these weapons and put your ninja skills to the limit in the additional story content added in the DLC, and in the main campaign by around the halfway point. While you'll need to beat the main story to access the DLC chapters, you won't have to beat the story to get your hands on the new DLC weapons.</p>



<p> You'll also be able to test the new weapons out in a brand new "<em>endurance-style mode</em>" called <strong>Abyssal Road</strong>, where success is measured by your ability to survive waves of combat encounters that get more and more difficult.</p>



<p>Part of the increased difficulty comes from new <strong>Special Blood Essence</strong> and <strong>Frenzied</strong> enemy mechanics that shake things up compared to what you got used to over the course of the rest of the game. There are also new bosses and enemies to face, though it seems like we'll have to encounter them in the DLC to learn about them, as Team NINJA doesn't go into any detail about the creatures that will try to get in Ryu and Yakumo's way.</p>



<p>Lastly, along with the new content, Team NINJA is also including a slew of quality-of-life updates and bug fixes that we'll hopefully learn more about next week when the update arrives. If you already own Ninja Gaiden 4 and want to grab the DLC, it'll run you an extra <strong>$14.99</strong> on its own, while the upgrade to the Digital Deluxe version of the game, which includes the DLC and a few in-game cosmetics, costs <strong>$20.</strong></p>



<p>That said, it is currently on sale on both <strong>PlayStation</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong>, with the deluxe edition of the game on sale for <strong>35% off</strong> on both platforms, and if you already have the game, the deluxe edition upgrade is <strong>25% off</strong> on both platforms. The only platform where it's not on sale, at least at the time of this writing, is Steam.</p>

Their website recently listed the new book, <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>, but has recently removed the announcement. In that brief time, however, details were gleamed.</p><h2>The <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em> Announcement and Removal</h2><p>According to the keen reporting of <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/paizo-accidentally-reveals-pathfinder-feybound-book.718090/" rel="nofollow">EN World's</a> Christian Hoffer, Paizo posted on their website details on <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>. As the name implies, the book is a Fey-themed supplement for the world of Golarion, giving adventurers and GMs further insight and knowledge about the beings of fairy tales.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-nixie-fey-artwork.jpg?itok=pVnBISOg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="700" height="812">

  </picture><p>Unfortunately, further information on the book is scarce. But, since this is the internet, some details have made it out into the wild. This includes the book including a gazetteer on the First World: the infinite plane of wilderness home to traveling faerie courts and extreme, unpredictable weather, and new information on the Eldest, the ancient godlike beings who reside there.</p><p>As for player options, the book will contain new fey-themed character archetypes and new fey ancestries like the faun, nymph, gremlin, and sprite. There are also new fadrim versatile heritages, allowing you to add a bit of fey magic to other characters. Lastly, the book will contain new spells, including curses, transformations, and memory manipulation.</p><p>For now, that is all that is available on <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>. Links to the book's listing go to a dead page. No MSRP. No release date. It can be speculated that book may be part of an upcoming Paizo Live stream, which highlights upcoming adventure paths and supplements for the game.</p><p>This makes sense since the book marks the debut of fey material in <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>. Which is made more intriguing since the prior edition was light on fey-material. There were a handful of adventure paths featuring fey, but that's about it. By contrast, getting a setting on the level of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" rel="nofollow"><em>Tian Xia</em></a> &nbsp;is sure to make fans excited to learn more.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 4 Is Shockingly Solid On Switch 2 Unlike Skyrim]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-switch-2-port-60-fps-40-30-performance-review-skyrim-bethesda-2000673651</link>
            <guid>1446271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> is out now on the Nintendo Switch 2. And after the rough release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 late last year</a>, I was nervous about how Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic RPG would fare on Nintendo’s hybrid machine. Turns out, I had nothing to fear as <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is totally solid. Not perfect, but pretty damn good.</p> <p>Launched on February 24, <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is the first mainline <em>Fallout</em> game to grace a Nintendo platform. (No, <em>Fallout Shelter</em> and <em>Fallout</em> pinball don’t count.) This version of the 2015 open-world blockbuster RPG contains all the DLC as well as a ton of extra Creation Club content, too. It also launched with not one, but three different framerate options, including a 60FPS option, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">which was lacking when <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> launched on Switch 2 last year.</a> And thankfully, according to many online who have played the new port,<em> Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 performs very well.</p>

  <h2><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s visual options on Switch 2</h2> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 includes three modes: a 60FPS performance option, a 30FPS visual mode, and a 40FPS visual mode. Online testing shows that in both handheld and portable, <em>Fallout 4</em> mostly sticks to these target framerates.</p> <p>There is one caveat: the 60FPs option can look really blurry in some areas. This is due to the lower resolution that <em>Fallout 4</em> can reach in its performance mode, especially in busy, outdoor areas. On the console’s portable screen, however, the 60FPS mode looks fine enough. Meanwhile, the 30FPS option offers a similarly stable experience, but with much sharper textures and better visual effects.</p>

 <p>But the best mode is probably the 40FPS option that takes advantage of the Switch 2’s 120hz screen. It will also work on a TV that supports 120hz in docked mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-and-village-are-damn-near-perfect-switch-2-ports-2000673230">40FPS has become a favorite of mine</a> this console generation as it offers up crisp visuals, yet provides a noticeably smoother gameplay experience, which is exactly what you’ll get in <em>Fallout 4.</em></p>

 <p>Regardless of what mode you pick, the fact that <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 even launched with all these options and they all mostly work is a huge improvement over <em>Skyrim’s</em> launch on the same console. That thing was a mess and was locked to 30FPS, though it has since been patched and dramatically improved.</p> <p>Many Switch 2 owners are hoping Bethesda does the same with <em>Fallout 4</em> and adds gyro controls and mouse support, something that this port is currently lacking. I don’t really care about those features, but it would be nice to see them added in the future. Still, this is a great port of <em>Fallout 4</em> that gives me hope for future Bethesda games on Switch 2. There is one area in which <em>Fallout 4</em> is worse than <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2, though. <em><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/58034-nintendo-eshop-file-size-round-up-for-feb-22nd-2026-fallout-4-resident-evil-titles">Fallout 4</a></em><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/58034-nintendo-eshop-file-size-round-up-for-feb-22nd-2026-fallout-4-resident-evil-titles"> takes up 61GB</a> of space compared to <em>Skyrim’s</em> 53GB install size. So be prepared to delete some stuff if you’re already struggling to find space on your Switch 2. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">Or buy a new memory card…if you can afford it right now.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming is proud to announce its debut virtual showcase.</p>



<p>Airing on <strong>May 28th at 3pm ET/12pm PT/8pm UK across Insider Gaming’s YouTube and social media platforms</strong>, the Insider Gaming Showcase comes to you with the goal of helping games get funded or find publisher backing.</p>



<p>But why? Well, to put it simply, the gaming industry is going through unprecedented times, and one of the hardest challenges that developers currently face is funding, and it’s only getting more difficult. That’s why we want to use our outlet and its exposure to help games get seen – <strong>completely free of charge</strong> to developers.</p>



<p>The showcase will feature nonstop, back-to-back game trailers, with no fluff in between to distract viewers from the awesome games currently in development. We’ll also feature a “concept” section in the showcase, featuring amazing concept art and ideas of games that haven’t yet reached a stage of development where footage can be shown.</p>



<p>Following the showcase, we will have separate deep-dive video interviews with the developers, in addition to written coverage on our website and in the app, so viewers can learn more about the games and the developers behind them.</p>



<p>In addition, Insider Gaming will also act as a PR agency to a loose degree. We will be working with other outlets and content creators before, during, and after the showcase to facilitate potential interviews to help get the games seen by as many different audiences as possible, again, free of charge.</p>



<p>To take things one step further, Insider Gaming will also compile all the games from the showcase into a dossier containing the contact information for each featured game, which we will send to our extensive list of investors, VC’s, and publishers after the show. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has high ambitions for the showcase, aiming to add at least 1 million cumulative new wishlists for the games we feature.</p>



<p>Moving past May 28th, we also want the showcase to be a recurring event, with a second showcase tentatively planned for December, with two shows a year moving forward.</p>



<p>Of course, we’re not ignorant of the fact that putting on a showcase costs time and money, and that’s why, behind the scenes, we’ve already partnered with a few companies to sponsor the show and are actively looking for a few more to help support this great initiative in times when developers need the exposure.</p>



<p>You can contact Tom Henderson at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99edf6f4d9f0f7eaf0fdfcebb4fef8f4f0f7feb7faf6f4" id="mailto:tom@insider-gaming.com">tom(a)insider-gaming.com</a> if you would like to sponsor the show. Developers can now submit their games by <strong>emailing Insider Gaming’s Executive Editor Mike Straw at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ce1e5efe4ede9e0cce5e2ffe5e8e9fea1ebede1e5e2eba2efe3e1">michael(a)insider-gaming.com</a></strong> or <a href="https://forms.gle/3AVqXsLDohEA173K6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filling out our submission form</a>: </p>



<p><strong>Submissions are open until March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Outlets and content creators can contact either email address above to get involved as partners or for potential co-streaming opportunities.@</p>

		<p>Having just celebrated the series’ 25th anniversary, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/total-war">Total War</a> and Horsham-based studio, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/creative-assembly">Creative Assembly</a>. For more than two decades, these games have helped define the strategy genre on PC, keeping fans hooked with new titles and impassioned post-launch support, exploring numerous historical eras and, more recently, the timeless world of Warhammer. Somehow, Creative Assembly has managed to pull off the remarkable feat of releasing game after game without Total War feeling too oversaturated, avoiding the kind of aggressive rehashing we see in other popular video game series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War - 25th Anniversary Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxLDUmptln8?list=PL7l8yJHLU_BHPMc7ZRfPmGQyz3NQsO4x5" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The past several years have taken the developer on a number of historical detours, starting with the wildly successful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/16/total-war-three-kingdoms-review/">Three Kingdoms</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/12/total-war-troy-review-pc-epic-steam/">Troy</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/total-war-pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>. Then, of course, we’ve had three back-to-back bangers set in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/total-war-warhammer">Warhammer’s Old World</a>, carefully adapting the Games Workshop tabletop game into one of the best video game trilogies available, bursting with bonus content.</p>


<p>Now, Creative Assembly is ready for an ambitious new pincer formation. Its next big game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-total-war-40k-ps5-xbox-pc/">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a>, will be the franchise’s most experimental title to date, transporting players to the grimdark future of the 41st millennium. It’s not just a tonal shift, but also one that has various gameplay implications given the arsenal of sci-fi weapons and heavy armour at play, not to mention galactic-scale campaign maps.</p>
<p>At the same time, the studio is returning to one of its three core historical pillars. After more than twenty years since the launch of its predecessor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/total-war-medieval-iii-announced-at-series-25th-anniversary-total-war-engine-gets-ready-for-console-gaming/">Total War: Medieval III</a> will be a culmination of Creative Assembly’s work on refining its strategy game formula, boasting a truly tantalising sense of scale and depth.</p>


<p>Wanting to know more about the series and the prestigious team that brings these games to life, we recently interviewed Franchise Content Director, Kevin McDowell, Ian Roxburgh (Principal Creative Director), Jack Lusted (Product Owner), and Scott Pitkethly (Battle Architect) about Creative Assembly and the origins of Total War. You see, while it’s impossible to separate these two big names now, there was a time when the fledgling English developer worked on a very different kind of simulation game.</p>
<p>“Back in the late 90s, Creative Assembly was still a tiny studio and we were almost entirely known for making sports games for Electronic Arts. That was our identity. At the same time, there was this itch inside the team to try something new. Our old Executive Producer had been hired to lead an RPG based on Monkey: Journey to the West, and the plan was to build a whole new studio for it in Singapore… but for various reasons none of that ended up happening.”</p>
<p>“So, while the sports team kept the lights on, the rest of the studio started asking, ‘Well, what could we make?’ Command &amp; Conquer had just blown up, and everyone was talking about real-time strategy. The idea was to knock out a quick RTS to raise some money for the RPG they really thought they’d make next. However, once development started, the project quickly turned into something else entirely. We had this experimental tech that allowed for rolling 3D hills, voxel characters from the sports games, and then one programmer figured out how to transform that top-down RTS camera into what became the defining feature of Total War: the general’s-eye view. Suddenly you weren’t looking at sprites anymore; you were looking across a believable battlefield. Once the team saw that, the whole genre pivot happened almost instantly.”</p>
<p>“From there, the idea of combining massive real-time battles with a strategic layer just made sense. The team realised the battles alone weren’t enough; you needed a campaign map to give context and consequence to them. The studio shifted from sports games and the cancelled RPG to building something that nobody had ever really tried before. In a way, Total War wasn’t the result of a master plan. It was a chain reaction: abandoned projects, new technology, a bit of opportunism, and a small team willing to experiment. All those ingredients came together and suddenly we weren’t a sports studio anymore – we were building Total War.”</p>
<p>This was a huge gamble for the up-and-coming studio. Not only was it attempting to break new ground in a genre that was already dominated by the likes of Starcraft and Age of Empires, it was also delving into the Sengoku Jidai, a historical era that was still pretty alien to western gamers at the time – even the most cultured and sophisticated RTS enjoyer. On top of the new and experimental gameplay concepts showcased in Shogun: Total War, players had to learn the names of various Japanese generals and factions as they engaged in a bloody, katana-swinging civil war to unify the country.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Shogun would go on to become a critical and commercial success for Creative Assembly, paving the way for countless Total War sequels and spin-offs. Having built a solid foundation, Medieval: Total War soon followed in 2002. However, for a great number of fans, their first encounter with the franchise would come four years later, with the Rome: Total War, which was also the star of the BBC’s 2003 game show, Time Commanders. We asked Creative Assembly about this collaboration and the impact it had on Rome’s development.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Time Commanders - Trojan War" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lbmlg116nqM?list=PLrTVQ-ow5aA3D3d5tNFcUAgMnEvfyv8Wh" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Time Commanders came about surprisingly early in Rome’s development. We’d only just started showing the new engine around internally when the BBC reached out. They’d seen what we were doing with these huge, fully 3D battles and thought it would be perfect for a historical TV format where real people replayed famous battles. Almost overnight, we suddenly found ourselves building tools and features not just for a game, but for a television production as well.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t hinder development. If anything, it pushed Rome forward. To make the game presentable for national television, we had to build proper scripting systems, cinematic camera controls, and ways to choreograph battles long before those features were scheduled. Those same tools ended up shaping how we built Rome’s historical battles and how we showcased the game to press.”</p>
<p>“There were quirky restrictions, though. In the UK we couldn’t advertise our own game in any way during the show, which was a bit surreal. But even without that, the exposure was huge, and all the TV work happened within my first six months at the studio. It brought eyes to Rome long before it launched and ultimately helped shape the game into what it became. What a lot of people don’t know is that, on the back of the BBC version, we also did a pilot for an American TV series. Because it wasn’t the BBC, they were happy to lean into the Total War branding and the pilot literally opened with, “Welcome back to Total War,” with the logo everywhere. If that show had gone ahead, it would’ve been even more massive for us.”</p>
<p>Even without this major marketing push, Rome: Total War firmly cemented itself as one of the great strategy games of its age. While Creative Assembly has visited myriad flashpoints and timelines in the decades since, fans continue to revisit this earlier game in the series and its ancient historical setting.</p>
<p>“I think Rome has this enduring pull because it taps into a period almost everyone grows up learning about at some point,” the team explains. “The legions, the emperors, the conquests, it’s one of the first slices of history that really captures your imagination as a kid. When you see it recreated at scale, it hits that nostalgic memory as well as that fantasy of commanding these iconic armies. For our series in particular, Rome was also the first time we pushed into a fully 3D campaign map. That was a huge shift. Suddenly, instead of looking at something that felt like a board game, you were looking at a living world: mountain ranges, coastlines, settlements, terrain that felt real. You weren’t just reading about the Mediterranean – you were navigating it. The sense of physical space made Rome’s already epic history feel even bigger and more immersive.”</p>

<p>“Our old colleague used to describe Rome as the ‘ultimate box of toy soldiers,’ and that’s exactly what it felt like. With that 3D map, those iconic units, and battles that suddenly looked cinematic in a way we’d never achieved before, you had this perfect marriage of recognisable history and cutting-edge technology. Even though it wasn’t the first Total War game, Rome hit a sweet spot: a universally familiar setting, larger-than-life experiences, and a brand new visual and technological leap that made the whole era feel alive in a way players hadn’t seen before.”</p>
<p>As for the history of the Roman Empire itself, it spans many centuries, from the republic’s early founding in ancient times to its eventual splintering and later fall. For Total War, how did the team decide on which Roman eras to feature in their campaigns and expansions?</p>
<p>“Rome’s history is just too big to cover in one go, so the first step is figuring out which eras naturally lend themselves to strong campaign gameplay. We look for those flashpoints where multiple powers are colliding, borders are moving, and the whole region feels like it’s at a tipping point – moments where the player can jump in and genuinely reshape what happens next.”</p>
<p>“That’s why we tend to focus on periods like the late Republic or the rise of the Empire. They’re full of internal crises, ambitious rivals, external pressures, and distinct faction identities. Those eras also give every faction, not just Rome, a meaningful place on the map from the very start. That balance matters to us. We want the campaign to feel alive across the whole space, not like a story where everyone else exists just to watch Rome grow. The choice ends up being a mix of what’s historically iconic, what naturally creates interesting gameplay, and what allows the entire world to feel dynamic. The goal is to build a setting where Rome is important, of course, but not the only story worth playing.”</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the most appealing parts of playing Rome: Total War and its sequel is leading factions such as the Carthaginians, Gauls, or even the Britons to rewrite history, during a time period where Rome was rapidly ascending as an ancient superpower. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/09/02/total-war-rome-2-review/">Rome II</a> kicks off its Grand Campaign in 272BC and spans 300 years, witnessing the republic’s transition into an empire. This choice of setting makes perfect sense, given Creative Assembly’s approach, with historic turning points such as the destruction of Carthage, the collapse of Hellenistic Greece, and the rise of Parthia, not to mention a number of civil wars within Rome itself.</p>
<p>From a game design perspective, this time period presents a great many pieces that can be placed on the board before hitting play on Total War’s strategic simulation and watching the various factions duke it out. Within this virtual sandbox, players can orchestrate countless “what if?” scenarios, both on and off the battlefield.</p>
<p>Speaking of battles, despite the vast amount of knowledge we’ve gleaned over the centuries, we still don’t really know how ancient armies fought. There are very few historical sources that go into specific details regarding tactics and battle formations. We asked Creative Assembly how this impacted the team’s depiction of sweeping strategic battles, considering how central these are to the Total War experience.</p>
<p>“That’s a really good question, because even when we do have sources, they rarely tell us what we actually want to know. We’re dealing with a period where huge parts of battlefield behaviour just aren’t recorded. Even something as fundamental as how hoplites fought is still debated today. Was the ‘push’ a literal scrum of shields, a more symbolic back-and-forth as morale ebbed, or something much looser? Right from the start, we’re working with incomplete information, even in places where the historical record feels relatively strong.”</p>

<p>“What we try to do is anchor ourselves in the areas historians do broadly agree on: archaeology, surviving texts, experimental archaeology, and insights from similar cultures. Those give us the foundation. From there, we shape mechanics that feel believable and readable in a Total War context. We’re not aiming for perfect historical reconstruction, nobody can, because the sources just don’t support it, but we want battles to feel authentic within the limits of what we know while still giving players the drama and clarity they expect.”</p>
<p>“A lot of that comes from taking the broad principles ancient writers talk about – Roman discipline, Celtic charges, Greek phalanx tactics – and then figuring out how those ideas translate into a game where units need to behave as cohesive groups. For example, in Rome II we gave hoplites a shield-wall formation that tightens them up, boosts their defence, and gives that sense of a heavy, disciplined block of soldiers. It’s not claiming to be a perfect simulation of a phalanx, but it captures the logic of how they potentially fought.”</p>
<p>“When the sources fall silent, we fill the gaps the best way we can: good scholarship, a lot of experimentation in the engine, and making sure whatever appears on screen feels coherent to the player. And of course, popular media has an influence. It would be silly to pretend films like Gladiator haven’t shaped player expectations of ancient combat. We’re not going full Hollywood with everyone duelling one-on-one in a big melee, because that’s neither accurate nor good for gameplay, but a little spectacle – a fire arrow here, a dramatic shield wall there – can work, as long as it still feels grounded.”</p>
<p>“And yes, we absolutely consult experts and research heavily. For Rome II, we built up a whole library on everything from cavalry use to Greek warfare to Roman infantry tactics. We won’t always get every detail right, and sometimes we deliberately prioritise gameplay over strict interpretation, but the aim is always to be as informed as possible so that even when we’re making educated guesses, they’re supported by the best knowledge available.”</p>
<p>Even with the Roman legions being well-known for their cohesion and discipline, they probably didn’t tuck as neatly or as quickly into formations as the Total War games would have us believe. Yet, overall, the way these games depict ancient battles is so believable, driven by on-the-fly calculations that compare unit statistics as they engage in combat, from Celtic Slingers and Spartan Pikemen to Ptolemaic Cavalry and the Praetorian Guard. So, how do the developers of Total War go about assigning stats to various historical units?</p>
<p>“There is a lot of number-crunching behind the scenes, yes,” the team tell us, “but [our] guiding philosophy is pretty simple. We don’t want any faction to feel like it’s inherently disadvantaged just because of the stat sheet. If you’re playing as the Iceni, Rome should feel like a heavyweight opponent, but the game should never make you feel like the numbers are fully stacked against you. You should win because you used your units better tactically, not because the AI was mathematically unbeatable.”</p>

<p>“We start with historical context. Who was well-armoured? Who hit hard? Who excelled at charges? We then convert that into a set of behaviours and stats, and we balance it so that every roster has a path to victory if you play to its strengths. That’s also why different units end up being ‘the best’ depending on their battlefield role: Roman Evocati Cohort as elite infantry, Oathsworn for the Celtic tribes, Shield Bearers for the Greeks, Companion Cavalry or cataphracts on the shock-cavalry side. They all excel in different areas. There isn’t one single stat monster – it’s about what problem a unit is designed to solve and how players choose to use it.”</p>
<p>There is one Rome: Total War unit we’ve always found particularly amusing: the Incendiary Pigs. As their name implies, these unfortunate hogs are coated in flammable material before being herded towards enemy ranks and then set aflame. Remarkably, these pigs aren’t some kind of twisted invention concocted by a deeply troubled and twisted Total War developer.</p>
<p>“The flaming pigs are a great example of one of those things that players assume we just made up, but we had this internal rule back then: if we could find one historical reference, no matter how obscure, then it was fair game to put into the title. And that’s how a lot of the stranger units made it in.”</p>
<p>“The pigs really were mentioned as a tactic to panic war elephants – cover them in tar, set them alight, and let chaos do the rest. Horrifying, but historically referenced. The same goes for the head hurlers. People still think we invented those, but someone on the team dug up a single line in a text mentioning warriors throwing severed heads, and that was it – green light to develop. We even used photos of our own faces for the decapitated heads. One of us still swears you can see his on the back of the game box.”</p>
<p>“So yes, even if it looks like wild fiction, it was probably because we found one dusty mention in a source somewhere and decided that was enough justification. That was the balance we struck back then between history and gameplay: if history gave us an inch, we took a mile.”</p>

            <guid>1446232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="eb5c8d1d3feff"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb5c8d1d3feff/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom is truly treating us Switch 2 owners this week, as it releases not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village</a> on the new hardware, but also the brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a>. Yep, that's on the same day as other platforms!</p>
<p>All of these launch on <strong>27th February</strong> (a Pokémon Day surprise, if we've ever seen one), and today, the Requiem reviews have started rolling in to clue us up on Leon and Grace's latest.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a fantastic time with RE9, calling it "a love letter that celebrates RE’s origins; one that will have you grinning from ear to ear until the credits roll" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a brief snippet, followed by the full shebang, so you can catch all the details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem sets a new benchmark for a series that has been pretty consistently great for the last decade or so. By combining classic survival horror with the more action-focused gameplay of RE4, the result is an experience paced to perfection. Add in a lore-heavy narrative and copious easter eggs, and you've got what might be the ultimate expression of Resident Evil</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:197602 @ 1772047262 -->
<p>But, of course, we're not the only ones with a Requiem review out today. Being the big multi-platform release that it is, there are a fair few write-ups for the game at large across the internet, and below, we've gathered a bunch of them together for you to easily see the full range of opinions. Do note that while we've highlighted some reviews that focus solely on the Switch 2 version, many outlets will have been playing on different platforms.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a full beans 10/10 score for the PS5 version from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/resident-evil-requiem-the-mercenaries-mode-326263-20260215">GAMINGbible</a>, where the outlet praised just about everything the game had to offer, particularly in its lore drops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a horror game in its own right, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is a very solid nine out of ten, but as a passionate fan of the series, it earns an additional bonus point thanks to the attention to detail and craft that’s gone into every pore of this game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full scores kept coming with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-review">Eurogamer</a>'s 5/5 review, where even the game's strange second act wasn't enough to detract from the overall experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/resident-evil-requiem/review">Pocket Tactics</a> opted for the same score as us in another 9/10 Switch 2 review, calling out how impressively well the title runs on Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It runs incredibly well on the Nintendo Switch 2, boasts a compelling cast, and a story that fits nicely into the Resident Evil universe at large</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an opinion that was echoed in <a href="https://www.vooks.net/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a>' 4.5/5 review of the Switch 2 version, where the hybrid's visuals got a major nod of their own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t say it’s the very first visually impressive game running on the Switch 2; however, it does stand out as one of the first day-and-date games that truly holds its own</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Switch 2 version was laden with even more praise in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-review">TechRadar Gaming</a>'s 4/5 review, even if the outlet was a little disappointed with the game's second half:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To developer Capcom’s credit, while events may veer unapologetically into the camp and ridiculous, I was practically on the edge of my seat, wondering what on Earth could possibly happen next</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a slightly lower PS5 review, our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/resident-evil-requiem">Push Square</a> gave Requiem an 8/10 after struggling with the "imbalance" between the survival horror and action gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is brilliant, both when you’re avoiding zombies as Grace and cracking their skulls as Leon — but, eventually, there’s slightly too much of one and not enough of the other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll round things out with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-review-36772690">The Mirror</a>'s multiplatform 3/5 review, where, despite the "drop-dead gorgeous" visuals (even on Switch 2), that sense of imbalance was enough to bring things down a little:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem attempts to blend all eras of the franchise together with a dual-pronged campaign that features terrifically scary highs and some all-too terrifying lows</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em>Some</em> range in opinions, then, but it looks rather positive overall. As it stands, Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2 is currently sitting at a 90 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/resident-evil-requiem/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metascore</a> across 12 critic reviews, and an 88 on PS5 across 112.</p>

              <p>If you randomly received a bunch of test messages from the Xbox mobile app today, you didn’t do anything wrong. Many others, including myself, received the random spam messages this afternoon.</p> <p>On February 25 at around 12:30 PM Eastern time, people with the Xbox app installed on their phone began receiving multiple test notifications in quick succession. I received eight such test messages, and all of mine featured the icon for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> for some odd reason. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolefacee.bsky.social/post/3mfp7awat4s2h">Others online shared screenshots</a> that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numbereighty3.bsky.social/post/3mfpakbuot223">showed even more messages</a> than I received. Each message contained the following text:</p> <blockquote><p>“This is a dummy message sent via Braze, please capture a screenshot once you receive it. This should take you to the recently added gallery.”</p></blockquote> <p>A quick Google search seems to indicate that <a href="https://www.braze.com/product/overview">Braze is some sort of cross-platform social media and digital messaging platform</a> used by a lot of different big companies. So it seems likely that the Xbox app is using Braze or is switching over to it, and something went wrong and now a bunch of people have random test messages spamming their home screen.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Xbox for comment. We only sent one email. Not seven.</p> <p>The timing of this odd tech snafu couldn’t be worse for Xbox as the company is going through a big and <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">reportedly messy shake-up, with longtime CEO Phil Spencer stepping down last week</a> and a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">AI-focused CEO taking over in his place</a>. Some, including myself, have suggested this is the end of Xbox as we know it. That it might be dead. But I guess a dozen random messages in the afternoon proves it’s still alive. At least part of it.</p> <p><b>Update: 2/25/26, 2:15 p.m. ET: </b>An Xbox spokesperson pointed <em>Kotaku</em> to<a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/2026732606612480313"> a post from the official Xbox account on Twitter</a>. The company says the issue is “resolved now” and apologized for the spam. No explanation of what actually happened was given.</p>

 <p>“The Xbox App got a little too enthusiastic with test notifications today. That’s on us, but it’s resolved now. Thanks for understanding, and we apologize for flooding your notifications,” said Xbox on social media.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC will release next week, in March 2026. </p>



<p>Team Ninja’s latest mainline entry to the Ninja Gaiden franchise was released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in October 2025</a> and has been faring quite well since release. Now, the developers have finally provided an update on how they plan to expand the experience with a brand-new DLC for the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-dlc-will-add-new-story-missions-weapons-and-more">Ninja Gaiden 4 DLC Will Add New Story Missions, Weapons, and More</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new post by Team Ninja on <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the release date of the new The Two Masters DLC for Ninja Gaiden 4, and it arrives on March 4, 2026. The new DLC will add three new chapters, weapons, enemies, and the Abyssal Road challenge mode. Learn more about the new additions below. </p>



<p>The story expansion for Ninja Gaiden 4 will see Yakumo and Ryu’s battle against fiends continue, as the two characters battle against even deadlier enemies, challenging bosses, and new trials. The new weapons will also help expand Yakumo and Ryu’s combat styles. Yakumo will receive the “Solitaire” scythe, which is great for crowd control, and Ryu’s will get “Jakotsumon” serpent gauntlets, which are useful for fast, close-quarters combat.</p>



<p>Abyssal Road in the Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC is an endurance-style mode where players face 100 unique combat encounters. These encounters include enemies from both the base game and the DLC, and introduce the new Special Blood Essence and Frenzied enemy mechanics, which dynamically alter battle conditions.</p>



<p>The DLC will also arrive with “a wide range of quality-of-life improvements, balance adjustments, and bug fixes, including combat responsiveness improvements, new weapon set customization options, and fixes across multiple chapters to ensure a smoother experience throughout the campaign.” Players with Deluxe Edition or Deluxe upgrade will get the DLC for free, and others can buy it for $14.99 on March 4. </p>

Hocking had been leading work on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-hexe">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>, the upcoming entry in Ubisoft's flagship series that's set to feature a witchcraft vibe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to IGN, a Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed Hocking was "departing Ubisoft" without providing further detail as to why. His current role as creative director on Hexe will now be assumed by Jean Guesdon, the series' new Head of Content, who has a lengthy track record working on numerous titles in the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Clint Hocking, creative director on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe, will be departing Ubisoft," a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement provided to IGN. "We sincerely thank him for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team. The game will deliver something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise. Jean Guesdon, Head of Content for the Assassin's Creed brand, is now acting as the Creative Director on the project.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to sharing more information in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hocking initially joined Ubisoft to work on the legendary 2002 stealth action adventure Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, which he contributed to as a designer and scriptwriter. Hocking then served as creative director on its follow-up, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, before holding the same role on 2008's Far Cry 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a period away from Ubisoft, Hocking served years at LucasArts, Valve and Amazon, respectively, albeit without ultimately launching a game. Hocking then returned to Ubisoft to serve once again as a creative director, this time on Watch Dogs: Legion, which launched to a mixed response. Following that, Hocking moved over to Assassin's Creed, and had been leading work on Hexe out of the company's Montreal studio.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Ubisoft named its trio of top staff tasked with taking the Assassin's Creed brand forward. Development on the series will now ultimately be led by Martin Schelling, a veteran Ubisoft producer who previously served senior roles on Assassin's Creed titles such as Black Flag, Origins and Valhalla, and has recently served as Ubisoft's Chief Production Officer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schelling is being assisted Guesdon, who has worked on more than a dozen titles in the franchise, back to Assassin's Creed 1 in 2007, and notably served in director roles for both Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed: Origins. Finally, François de Billy will serve as Head of Production Excellence, following previously acting as Production Director on Valhalla and Origins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes follow last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">sudden departure of Ubisoft's previous Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté</a>, a veteran staff member who announced his departure from the company last October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embattled-ubisoft-forms-subsidiary-for-ips-like-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-with-the-help-of-116-billion-tencent-investment">shortly after Ubisoft's new Tencent-backed subsidiary Vantage Studios took control of the brand</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft-for-13-million-alleges-his-disguised-dismissal-was-to-avoid-severance-pay">Côté has since launched a lawsuit against Ubisoft</a> over the nature of his replacement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reaffirmed that the company had "several" Assassin's Creed titles in development, comprised of both single-player and multiplayer experiences. Back in 2022, Ubisoft announced a raft of upcoming games including Hexe, as well as a multiplayer spin-off codenamed Invictus. The company is also widely-expected to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ah-s-here-we-go-again-ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leak-responds-with-gta-meme">announce its long-awaited Black Flag remake soon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, nothing has been said of Hexe's progress, though fans had assumed this was simply because Ubisoft was focused on launching and marketing last year's Assassin's Creed Shadows. Almost a year on from Shadows' arrival, there's no suggestion that Hexe will debut in 2026, particularly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">Ubisoft delayed a raft of upcoming titles back in January, as part of the company's major corporate restructure</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Christian Petersen/Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has seemingly lost another one of its veteran developers as part of its ongoing organizational restructuring following the company's announcement of a <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"major reset</a></em></strong>" last month. After learning <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-taps-senior-assassins-creed-black-flag-devs-to-lead-assassins-creed-future/">who would be taking charge</a> of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise going forward in its new structure yesterday, today we've learned that <strong>Clint Hocking</strong>, a Ubisoft veteran who was the creative director on <strong>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</strong>, <strong>Far Cry 2, Watch Dogs: Legion</strong>, and most recently the creative director on the upcoming <strong>Assassin's Creed: Hexe</strong> project, has left the company.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/">VGC</a> initially reported Hocking's departure, and when we reached out to Ubisoft to confirm the report, we received the following statement in response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Clint Hocking, Creative Director on <strong>Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe</strong>, will be <strong>departing Ubisoft</strong>. We sincerely thank him for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter.</em> <em>Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team. The game will deliver something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise. <strong>Jean Guesdon</strong>, Head of Content for the Assassin's Creed brand, is now acting as the Creative Director on the project.</em> <em>We look forward to sharing more information in the future.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since the Hexe project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/">announced in 2022</a> alongside other future AC titles, we've only <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/">heard rumours about the upcoming title</a>, and most recently heard that it had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/">pushed to sometime in 2026</a>. Since the company's major restructuring announced last month, and now Hocking's departure, it seems likely that Hexe is one of the titles that was delayed in the portfolio shifting Ubisoft did, which included cancelling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/"><strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>.</a></p>



<p>Hocking was with Ubisoft across two significant periods in his career. The first was a nine-year stay at the company during which he led development on Far Cry 2 and Chaos Theory as creative director. He left in 2010 to join <strong>LucasArts</strong> for two years, then <strong>Valve</strong> for one year, and <strong>Amazon Game Studios</strong> for one year. He then rejoined Ubisoft in 2015, where he led the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/"><strong>Ubisoft Toronto</strong> </a>team on Watch Dogs: Legion before joining the Montreal team to work on Hexe.</p>



<p>Hocking may not have been with the Assassin's Creed franchise throughout his whole Ubisoft career, like another recently departed Ubisoft veteran, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">Marc-Alexis Côté,</a></strong> but as the creative director behind two of the company's most iconic titles, his departure signals how the company's 'reset' continues to include a changing of the old guard, of sorts, at least when it comes to those in major creative roles.</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">Julian Gerighty</a></strong>, and now Clint Hocking are all senior creative leads, all of whom have led successful projects for Ubisoft, all of whom the company has now lost in this reorganization. While we know that Gerighty left to go work on the <strong>Battlefield</strong> franchise, it's unclear who will scoop up Hocking and Côté.</p>



<p>Ultimately, in a company as big as Ubisoft, a project's success or failure cannot be laid at the feet of an individual person. That said, it does not bode well to continue seeing people who have stuck with Ubisoft for years look elsewhere in the industry.</p>

              <p>If you’re a <em>Pokémon</em> fan, you have no doubt experienced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-big-pokemon-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1849984595">mainline games</a> with all their catching, battling, and being the very best like no one ever was. But the series has a wide selection of spin-off games that span different genres and subject matter. Even if you’ve only ever played the RPGs, there’s probably something for you in the spin-offs simply because there’s such a wide range of experiences to be found. So what better to do with an eclectic collection of <em>Pokémon </em>games than to come up with a qualitative ranking to decide which is the best? We’re just days away from the series’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968">30th anniversary stream</a> where we’ll learn what The Pokémon Company is up to in 2026, so to get ourselves in the mood, we’ve rounded up 25 of the most notable <em>Pokémon </em>spin-off games, putting them in order from real stinkers to some of the most important games and sub-series in the franchise.</p> <p><em>This ranking was originally published in 2023.</em></p>
