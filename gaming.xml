The most concrete part of the news is that Annapurna — which also has an indie game publishing arm — will be funding half of the development budget for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453049/control-2-sequel-remedy-entertainment">the previously announced <em>Control 2</em></a>.</p><p>Beyond that, there’s the potential for Annapurna to create film and TV adaptations of both <em>Control</em> and <em>Alan Wake</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">just got a long-awaited sequel last year</a>.

<p>Corsair has unveiled its new Ultrawide curved monitor, the XENEON 34 QD-OLED. </p>



<p>Retailing <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/monitors/CM-9030005-NA/xeneon-34wqhd240-c-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-34-inch-3440-x-1440-wqhd-1800r-curvature-240hz-0-03ms-gtg-displayhdr-true-black-400-1-5m1-contrast-ratio-cm-9030005-na" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for $1,199.99</a>, this new monitor has a 34-inch WQHD screen size featuring an 1800R Curve Quantum Dot OLED Display. It also has a 0.03ms response time with a 240Hz refresh rate.</p>



<p>“QD-OLED enhances response times and refresh rates, making the XENEON 34 QD-OLED an ideal partner for high-speed gameplay, whether it’s racing, FPS, or action games,” Corsair says. “With a refresh rate of up to 240Hz combined with an impressive response time of up to 0.03ms (GtG), the image on screen reacts to inputs faster than you can perceive.”</p>



<p>The monitor also includes support for both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium.</p>



<p>The rear of the monitor features a number of I/O ports. Those include two HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C 3.1 DP ALT with 65W PD, USB-C 3.1 DP Upstream with 15W PD, four USB-A 3.1 with KVM, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. As far as on-screen display is concerned, that is activated by placing your hand near the bottom of the monitor.</p>



<p>Lastly, the monitor has burn-in prevention features like “an image retention refresh after eight hours of use and an Orbit feature that shifts the entire image by one pixel every three minutes”. </p>

Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios said on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3657534571513526776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> its game totalled "roughly 2,000,000 words" at launch, meaning Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 could be the new champ.</p><p>"Yesterday, we were counting with our lead designer Prokop Jirsa how much we actually wrote for KCD2," Vávra said. "So guess how big the script is? 2,200,000 words! Or 11,000 typical screenwriting pages.

A lot, most fans seem to predict.</p><p>Call of Duty sort of has this feature already in Warzone. In that game, The battle royale spin-off enables voice chat for deaths, so players can hear their opponent scream into the mic when they’re killed. This Body Shield feature for Black Ops 6, however, feels altogether more intimate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/29/cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-012-1724941507665.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Anyone who’s played Call of Duty multiplayer recently will know that there tends not to be much voice chat going on.

            <p>
Remedy Entertainment has announced a new partnership that'll see Annapurna Pictures financing half of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> in exchange for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
Control 2 - the sequel to Remedy's acclaimed 2019 paranormal shooter - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">officially announced back in 2022</a>. Earlier this month, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">revealed the project had now entered full production</a>, and that the Control 2 team was currently "working towards developing the game to an early functional state from beginning to end."
</p>
<p>
Remedy announced its new partnership in a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-inside-information-remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-control-2-and-bringing-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television/">statement shared on its website</a>, confirming Annapurna will finance 50 percent of Control 2's development budget and gain the rights to "expand the award-winning Control and Alan Wake franchises into film and television".

<p>
Remedy notes the terms of the deal will see it retain full IP rights for Control and Alan Wake, but that revenue share from the deal will shift according to the release medium. Remedy will receive a greater revenue share from sales of the Control 2 game after initial investments have been recouped, while Annapurna will receive a greater revenue share from its audiovisual productions.
</p>
<p>
"The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television," Annapurna CEO Megan Ellison said of today's news, "and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life. By leveraging Remedy's innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums."
</p>
<p>
Control and Alan Wake are, of course, set in the same universe, giving Annapurna significant flexibility in how the two properties might manifest for television and film.
</p>
<p>
Alongside Control 2, Remedy is currently developing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-details-control-live-service-multiplayer-spin-off">live-service multiplayer Control spin-off Condor</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-in-the-works-remedy-confirms">remakes of Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a>. The latter project is also now in full production. Remedy's next release, however, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-expansions-detailed-include-trip-inside-fictional-tv-show">Alan Wake 2's second DLC</a>, The Lake House, which arrives in October and sees players exploring a "mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organisation to conduct secret research".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/ps5-pro-design-and-announcement-plans-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro’s</a> design and plans for an announcement in the first half of September have been leaked.</p>
<p>The impressively well-informed billbil-kun, who made their name on French deals site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs</a> by very reliably leaking the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games line up over the past two years, is the source of this latest scoop. They dig into the general marketing plan for September, confirming certain elements previously aired by Jeff Grubb on his <a href="https://youtu.be/o8TqCntkFPg?t=2131">Game Mess Morning</a> podcast, who says that a State of Play showcase will take place toward the end of September, likely tying in with Tokyo Game Show.</p>


<p>The PS5 Pro announcement, however, is expected before this in the first half of September, according to billbil-kun.</p>
<p>Another juicy element regards the console’s design, which… well it will look like a slightly glammed up PS5 Slim and PS5. You still have the popped collar style, but the divide in panels will have four grooves to it – Sony will probably note the four grooves as opposed to the three stripes between them, so as not to get Adidas’s lawyers excited.</p>

<p>It’s obviously difficult to talk about absolute dimensions from a sketch, but they note that the PS5 Pro looks thicker than the PS5 Slim, which makes sense. However, the multi-panel design matches up in style with the Slim and it’s feasible that there is crossover with compatibility for the swappable panels. The added grooves would make the Pro a bit longer, and if there’s a little more filling to the sandwich, that will bring the cooling capacity back closer to the original PS5’s power threshold.</p>
<p>Of note, there is no sign of a disc drive in the sketch, and billbil-kun cannot confirm if the console will have an SKU that features physical media support out of the box. Sony is very likely, however, to build in support for the PS5 Slim’s detachable disc drive as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p>So, basically, watch this space for a big PS5 Pro reveal within the next couple of weeks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced that it's teaming up with Annapurna for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>financing, as well as to bring&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>to the worlds of TV and film.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on Remedy's official website, the Finnish studio says Annapurna will "co-finance the development" of&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, and that Annapurna will also take "the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>franchises to film, TV and beyond".</p>
<p>The developer says this partnership will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>"exactly the game we want it to be". Contrary to what you might expect, Annapurna won't be publishing&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, either; that responsibility will still fall to Remedy itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-remedy-annapurna-rocks.jpg?itok=XE-12wYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-remedy-annapurna-rocks.jpg?itok=KP3PyMII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>sequel will be partially financed by Annapurna.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering how far along in the development process&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is, Remedy says the development team is "working full steam ahead on the game".</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say that it knows fans are eager for news on both this and <i>Condor</i>, Remedy's upcoming multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff, but that you'll "have to wait a while for that".</p>
<p>Last we knew,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy">sitting in the "production readiness stage"</a>, which likely indicates that it'll begin full production in the coming months. It's likely we'll hear from the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">Condor</a>&nbsp;</em>before that; they're both in "full production", according to Remedy.</p>
<p>Of course, we still don't know exactly when we'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know when the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes will arrive. We'll just have to wait for more from Remedy on that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/max-payne-remakes-control-remedy.jpg?itok=LsLuYEh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/max-payne-remakes-control-remedy.jpg?itok=hcUDKASI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes are moving full steam ahead.</figcaption></figure><p>It feels appropriate for Remedy to be self-publishing&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, given that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the franchise rights</a> from former publisher 505 Games back in February.</p>
<p>Additionally, this extra injection of funding will no doubt come as a relief to Remedy, especially with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">cancellation of Tencent collab&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">Codename Kestrel</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">lack of&nbsp;profitability for&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">Alan Wake 2</a>&nbsp;</em>looming in the background.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Remedy has in store for us with regards to&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Fallout 76’s next major update is on the horizon and almost ready to be released. It’s called Milepost Zero – Country Road, and it’ll bring about a fresh host of changes to the Fallout 76 platform, including new camp mechanics, an interesting quest loop, and various quality-of-life upgrades and tweaks.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just published a roadmap that highlights what’s happening in Fallout 76 until the end of 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-fallout-76">What’s Next For Fallout 76?</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 has a stacked roadmap ahead, but fans will be displeased to notice that it’s the same old events on repeat. Aside from the deployment of Milepost Zero, there’s nothing <strong>too special </strong>on the cards for Fallout’s MMORPG title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 18: Milepost Zero - Country Road" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXrFWx_jwKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>On September 3, Milepost Zero rolls out worldwide, and midway through the month, users will flock to the platform to take advantage of a Double XP Weekend event. In October, it’s all about Halloween, with Spooky Scorched stalking the hills of Appalachia. It’s also the month when ‘Fallout Day’ arrives, with fans celebrating ‘Bombs Drop Day’ on October 23.</p>



<p>Moving into November, an Invaders From The Beyond event begins, followed by Fallout 76’s regularly scheduled birthday celebration. That takes place on November 14. Finally, in December, players can enjoy the typical Holiday Scorched event, along with Double Mutations and Double XP events aplenty.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to anything in particular going forward?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-to-bring-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television.967428/</guid>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced a strategic partnership with Annapurna Pictures, the core purpose of which is to have the latter company ‘finance 50% of the development budget for the upcoming Control 2.’ This partnership will also give Annapurna the production rights for Control and Alan Wake, to create live-action adaptations of both franchises.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-adaptations">More Adaptations</h2>



<p>Alan Wake and Control will translate nicely into live-action adaptations. The former franchise already features plenty of live-action sequences, particularly in the 2023 release of Alan Wake 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-inside-information-remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-control-2-and-bringing-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking on the deal</a>, Megan Ellison, the CEO of Annapurna, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television, and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life. By leveraging Remedy’s innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This deal will see Remedy Entertainment earn a greater revenue share from the sales of subsequent releases – primarily Control 2 – while Annapurna will reap the larger revenue share from any ‘audiovisual productions’. </p>



<p>Remedy’s CEO, Tero Virtala, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This strategic partnership between Annapurna and Remedy is an important milestone and an exciting opportunity for us. We know Annapurna shares our passion for our IPs and the universes we have created. With award-winning movies such as Zero Dark Thirty and games like Stray, Annapurna’s expertise across film, TV, and video games makes them an ideal partner for us. This agreement will ensure we can develop Control 2 into the best game possible, allow us to move into self-publishing for selected titles and expand our franchises to other mediums.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think we need more live-action adaptations of video game franchises, or should they start to slow down?</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Content warning: This article mentions self-harm.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Longtime players of EA Sports games may recall how the publisher's famous slogan, "It's in the game," is actually a shortened version of the full sentiment one would hear upon booting up any of its many sports games across several decades: "If it's in the game, it's in <em>the game</em>." This simple phrase worked well for a long time as a way to tout authenticity. If you're seeing it on the field (or rink, court, et al), you can bet it'll be in the video game simulation. That was the promise anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">But it worked. The soundbyte is iconic; I can still hear it in my head even as EA dropped the first half of that slogan years ago, and today, the Madden team's North Star is, arguably more than ever, authenticity. It's a word that comes up constantly whenever I speak to members of the EA Orlando (formerly Tiburon) team. But this year's NFL season is set to introduce a stark contrast between what's in the game and what's in <em>the game</em>: Guardian Caps.</p><p dir="ltr">Invented in 2010, Guardian Caps represent the latest in player-safety equipment. These bulky, quilt-like coverings go over a player's traditional helmet and are meant to protect players' brains more than even the best helmets can on their own. Since 2022, players have been wearing Guardian Caps in practice sessions. They became a practice mandate last season and have been spotted in preseason games this summer. When the 2024 season kicks off in a few days, it'll mark the first time the admittedly aesthetically awkward protective layers are <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games">approved for use in regular season games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can opt to use a Guardian Cap as individuals. This means some teams may have no players using them in games, while others may have several running around the gridiron in Guardian Caps this fall. For now, it's a personal choice, though we'll see what the future holds for a sport beleaguered by head trauma and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/interactive/2024/nfl-concussion-settlement/">resulting legal problems</a> such an epidemic has created.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359074-ss_8a6e45ae05dd3ed8a8570f67f9cf011e66714450.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359074-ss_8a6e45ae05dd3ed8a8570f67f9cf011e66714450.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359074"></a><figcaption>In lockstep with the league, EA has made a concerted effort to stop glorifying football's violence in recent years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359074-ss_8a6e45ae05dd3ed8a8570f67f9cf011e66714450.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Guardian Caps might be a powerful tool to reduce the frequency of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, better known as CTE. This degenerative disease can occur when a person suffers multiple concussions in their lifetime, and can lead to tragic consequences including memory and cognition loss, mood disorders, and even suicide. When former NFL player Dave Duerson died by suicide in 2011, he did so by shooting himself in the chest, and he left a note imploring that his brain be studied for signs of trauma he believed he was suffering from as a result of playing football. A year later, linebacker Junior Seau died in the same manner, and though no note was left behind, some believe Seau's unspoken message was the same as Duerson's note. Both men were posthumously found to have definitive signs of CTE.</p><p dir="ltr">For the NFL, CTE is a major image problem, as well as a legal concern, as depicted in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion_(2015_film)" rel="nofollow ">Concussion</a>, based on true events regarding a forensic pathologist countering the league's attempts to bury his findings on CTE. Today the league is still trying to separate itself from its ugly history, which has had the positive effect of driving more numerous and robust player-safety initiatives, whether that's to seriously improve player safety or just cover its ass in court--realistically, it's both. For a long time, coaches and even afflicted players often preferred to sweep concussions under the rug. This was an open secret in the NFL, and many football players of any level--even in high school--would likely tell you what they have told me: Whatever their number of reported concussions is, the truth is something higher.</p><p dir="ltr">When Guardian Caps debuted in 2022, the league said that they can reduce the force from head contact by 10% if one player is wearing it, and 20% if all players involved are wearing them. Like masking in a pandemic, they work best when everyone wears one, so I expect them to become more popular and perhaps even mandated eventually. But you'll not see it depicted in Madden, EA's best-selling football game, because in that case, the league's answer has long been to ignore concussions altogether.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to confirm when exactly Madden stopped depicting concussions. Without the much older games in my library anymore, and without EA or the league willfully commenting on this topic, I'm at the mercy of a murky online discussion that offers several half-truths and urban legends. For example, some say Madden stopped showing concussions after 2001, but really, this was just the ambulance that would sometimes arrive to take injured players off the field. The <a href="https://madden.fandom.com/wiki/Ambulance" rel="nofollow ">league requested this feature be taken out</a> because it felt the game was making light of major injuries, though concussions weren't taken out at that time.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also some gray area regarding when the language of "concussion" was switched to "head injury." According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180820102453/https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2014/03/12/ea-sports-madden-features-nfl-remove" rel="nofollow ">now-deleted Sports Illustrated feature</a>, EA says this was done for authenticity reasons, given that players' injuries are not immediately diagnosed right after they're injured the way Madden had been depicting.</p><p dir="ltr">It's said that both the league and John Madden himself suggested that the Madden dev team depict concussions less frequently in its video game to better simulate the real-life frequency of the injury. However, due to such awful concussion reporting in the league at that time, the figures EA was told to align with are likely to have been extremely faulty. It may even be that the game's rate of concussions before those changes better reflected the obfuscated reality of the league's problem.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in Madden 2005 when players could deliver such earth-shattering hits that their opponents' helmets might fly off, but a year later, this was already gone. Again, EA said this was a technical limitation owed to moving the series to the new consoles for Madden 2006. It's worth noting that the launch-tackles that resulted in this animation of yesteryear are today punishable in the NFL by penalties, fines, and even suspensions for repeat offenders in what was another player-safety decision. Therefore, these moments were likely to have disappeared by now even if the game didn't do away with them so long ago.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359076-maddennfl252024-08-2815-15-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359076-maddennfl252024-08-2815-15-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359076"></a><figcaption>There are many ways to customize a player's gear in Madden, but one is glaringly absent.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359076-maddennfl252024-08-2815-15-11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Today, there are no concussions in Madden, and no "head injuries" either. To my memory, it's been years since they've been depicted--even animations of players clutching their helmets and feeling woozy after a play seem to have been wiped from the series. It's a popular--though unsubstantiated--fan theory that EA merely tweaked the language of injury reports that formerly mentioned head trauma to instead read as "bruised sternums," a class of injury that is now much more prevalent in Madden than real life.</p><p dir="ltr">But now, the emergence of in-game Guardian Caps re-opens the discussion around Madden and head injuries. Some players, even prominent ones like the Colts' Jonathan Taylor, say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X668NCBeOMY">they plan to wear a Guardian Cap in games this fall</a>. Just like Odell Beckham Jr's single half-sleeve or Derrick Henry's eye-black meant to look like a cross, these Guardian Caps will become synonymous with the players wearing them. Normally, this would be something EA would seek to depict in the game--"It's in the game," after all--but given Madden exists in a fantasy world free of head trauma, the absence of Guardian Caps will soon be obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 17 different helmets in Madden 25, including the single-bar helmet of the 1960s, which I assume is there for comedic effect. There are roughly a half-dozen different mouthguards, about the same number of visors, and many more facemasks. You can customize any player's gear in a significant number of ways, head to toe, but you can't give them a Guardian Cap, even if you'll see them wearing one this fall, because that would admit concussions exist, which modern Madden isn't willing--or, more likely, <em>allowed</em>--to do.</p><p dir="ltr">But as we move toward an all-Guardian Cap future in the NFL, the league and EA will have to find a new way of addressing the problem. Pretending it doesn't exist has long been a band-aid for a much more significant issue, and even if the NFL would've been content to promote that concussion-free alternate universe forever, the increasing adoption rate of Guardian Caps among NFL players forces it to acknowledge the problem directly. Guardian Caps are in the game, so when exactly will they be in <em>the game</em>?</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot reached out to EA for comment on this subject and the potential of Madden adding Guardian Caps in Madden NFL 25, though we haven't heard back yet. We'll update this story should EA respond.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami said that due to Monster Hunter's monumental success, he doesn't feel that there's a need for a new Dino Crisis game to exist.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Mikami said that he was surprised about how many people were wanting a new Dino Crisis game. "The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years," he explained.</p><p>Mikami continued, "So even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."</p><p>Capcom did reveal Exoprimal, a multiplayer third-person shooter, last year. When it was initially revealed, many fans thought it was a new Dino Crisis game, only to be disappointed. However, it has gotten mostly positive reviews, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/exoprimal-review-prehistoric-warfare/1900-6418097/" data-ref-id="1900-6418097">7/10 from GameSpot.</a> It's worth noting that Mikami currently has nothing to do with Capcom. The director and producer left the company years ago to found Tango Gameworks, which he left in 2023.</p><p>Monster Hunter: World has sold over <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240312.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">25 million units worldwide</a> as of March 2024. The next entry in the series, Monster Hunter Wilds, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">set to release in 2025.</a></p><p>Mikami was the producer on the original Dino Crisis back in 1999. He's currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-finally-speaks-out-about-his-departure/1100-6522985/" data-ref-id="1100-6522985">at Kamuy</a>, a studio he founded after leaving Tango.</p>
