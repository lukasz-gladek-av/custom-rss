		<p>Nintendo has announced that a demo for Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will arrive for Nintendo Switch next week, albeit in an unusual multi-stage fashion.</p>
<p>Starting on 20th August (19th August in North America), the Emio – The Smiling Man demo will dole out the prologue and first three chapters of the game over the course of eight days. At first only the Prologue and Chapter 1 will be available, followed by Chapter 2 a few days later and finally Chapter 3.</p>


<p>Here’s the dates that everything will be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>August 20th: Prologue and Chapter 1 (demo launch)</li>
<li>August 23rd: Chapter 2</li>
<li>August 28th: Chapter 3</li>
</ul>
<p>New chapters unlock at 6PM PT / 9PM ET / 2AM BST / 3AM CEST / 10AM JST, with the demo needing to be updated in order to access the new content.</p>
<p>The goal, from Nintendo’s perspective, is to build a little bit of communal intrigue for the game, with each chapter sure to end on a cliffhanger or some kind of revelatory bombshell. It’s another atypical marketing move by the publisher, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-has-been-revealed/">which started off with just a creepy teaser trailer for the game</a>.</p>

<p>This all builds up to the full launch of Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club on 29th August. Any progress that you make in the demo will transfer across to the full game, you’ll be glad to hear.</p>
<p>Emio – The Smiling Man is the first completely new Famicom Detective Club game in 27 years, though the series was revived a few years ago with a remake collection of the 1980s Famicom originals for Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>I reviewed Famicom Detective Club back in 2021, saying “It’s wonderful to have the classic Famicom Detective Club games remade with modern artwork and with full Western localisations, but the flow of these visual novel detective stories is distinctly lacking and infuriatingly obtuse at times. Still, we can hope this is a sign that Nintendo is considering a truly modern revival of the Detective Club series in future.”</p>
<p>Guess what? It was a sign!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/what-we-played-kunitsu-gami-dead-rising-deluxe-black-myth-wukong/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For the first time in a good while, I’ve been playing with my PlayStation VR 2, thanks to the renewed excitement of being able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">plug it into a PC and play Half-Life: Alyx for a bit</a>. That’s also come with all the techy nonsense joys of fiddling with setting files to get Star Wars Squadrons to run better, with half the “fun” on PC gaming being just getting to run as well as it possibly can. I’m probably alone in that…</p>
<p>Aside from that, I also got to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-a-breath-of-rotting-flesh-air-in-a-good-way/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, which is a much bigger deal than that name makes it sound.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> was first to check in, and he’s been playing some Gori: Cuddly Carnage for our upcoming review, as well as Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown –&nbsp;The gameplay is fun and I’m enjoying the exploration and combat,” he says, “but the story feels weak.”</p>
<p>It’s been (liquorice) all sorts for <strong>Ade</strong> this week, who’s been enjoying Lego Star Wars and Minecraft with his son, EDF 6 and Diablo IV with his partner, and some Kunitsu-Gami and Skull and Bones when hiding away from human contact.</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> snagged a PlayStation Portal for cheap, but yet to give it a go. I’m trying to convince him that his Steam Deck with an open source remote play app will be just as good, so we’ll see what he thinks if he gives that a try. As for what he’s actually playing, he’s been very tempted to play new and different games, but is sticking to Fallout: New Vegas –&nbsp;“I’m taken aback by just how much I like this game. There’s a definite jankiness and, without mods, some gameplay and visual shortcomings, though the world itself is incredibly immersive. Embarking on one quest usually leads to bumping into an entirely new faction or settlement, though not in a way that feels too overwhelming. I’m some 30 hours in now and have just wrapped the Honest Hearts DLC after accidentally stumbling upon that questline.”</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> had my back on the whole Chiaki4Deck thing, which is why I like him. He’s been playing a suitably quirky mix of Witchspring R, Fortnite, Ace Combat 5, and Ridge Racer 6!</p>
<p><strong>Nick P</strong> is another Kunitsu-Gami acolyte, as it’s become one of his favourite games of the year. He’s also been able to play some of the upcoming Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, which is “SO GOOD!”</p>
<p>Lover of all things card games as he is, <strong>Nic’s</strong> been back at it with the “heckin’ cute” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/mtg-arena-bloomburrow-review-magic-the-gathering/">Bloomburrow</a> expansion for MTG: Arena. Beyond that, he’s been reliving the chaotic point and clicking of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/sam-and-max-the-devils-playhouse-remastered-review/">Sam &amp; Max: The Devil’s Playhouse</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just been Destiny 2 for <strong>Tuffcub</strong> this week, but he’s gradually building up energy to tackle Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, so let’s swiftly move on to <strong>Gamoc</strong>. He made a start on Dustborn for our review, continued playing Rogue Trader and is now about 62 hours in, and finished off Little Hope from The Dark Pictures Anthology –&nbsp;he’s finding the series to be rather inconsistent.</p>

<p>And rounding things out for this week, Jason’s played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, with a review to explain why it’s not quite as good as he was hoping it would be</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13.955134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest expansion for New World is set to release this year, and players can get a glimpse at the action to come by participating in the New World: Aeternum Open Beta. For those who are interested, the Open Beta starts on September 13 and runs through September 16, giving players a couple of days to get some game time in and experience the new content.</p>
<p>The New World: Aeternum Open Beta will be available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a> in North America, South America, Europe, and APAC (Asia-Pacific). The beta also supports cross-play across all platforms, allowing people to team up with friends who may be on different platforms.</p>
<p>For those eager to get stuck into the New World: Aeternum Open Beta, players can pre-load the beta from 9 AM PT / 5 PM BST / 12 PM ET on September 11 across all platforms. Suppose you have some burning questions during or after the New World: Aeternum Open Beta. In that case, there is an FAQ available to read on the <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-gb/game/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World website</a>, which goes into detail to answer any important questions you may have regarding the game.</p>
<p>Not only is the New World: Aeternum Open Beta a great opportunity to see if this is an expansion they want to spend their money on, but those who delve into the beta will also be rewarded for their time and efforts. They can get an exclusive Aeternian Adventure skin and title, which will be available to players once New World: Aeternum is officially released on October 15.</p>
<p>For those wanting to pre-purchase, purchasing the New World: Rise of the Angry Earth expansion on Steam will automatically gain access to New World: Aeternum in a free update. You can purchase it on Steam for $29.99 or $69.98 if you want the Elysian Edition.</p>
<p>However, if you're on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5, you'll instead have to be forking out $59.99 for the New World: Aeternum Standard Edition. Alternatively, if you want to spend a bit more money, you can purchase the New World: Aeternum Deluxe Edition for $79.99, which includes the DLC, a Corrupted Soul Armor Skin, and a Corrupted Bear Mauler Mount for you to ride around in style.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the price difference between those on consoles and those who play the game on PC is astonishing, especially since Rise of the Angry Earth is a PC-specific expansion, with Aeternum being available across all platforms. This continues to disadvantage those who are on consoles by locking them out of a whole expansion's worth of content.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stranded-deep-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stranded-deep-2-announced-as-developer-opens-new-studio-branch.955131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stranded-deep-2-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer North Beach Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 survival-crafting game, as well as a brand new development outfit that's currently working on said sequel.</p>
<p>In a press release, North Beach reveals that it's opened up a new studio branch in Prague, and that it's this studio branch which will be heading up the development of&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, although the game sounds like it's still pretty early on in its development cycle.</p>
<p>Indeed, we don't yet know that much about&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>; we know it exists, and that the Prague North Beach team will be handling it, but beyond that, details regarding the game are relatively scarce.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stranded-deep-2-announced-stranded-deep-whale.jpg?itok=RLY5JkIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stranded-deep-2-announced-stranded-deep-whale.jpg?itok=csjWAZPw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Underwater survival game&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep&nbsp;</em>is getting a sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>The new North Beach Prague team will be headed up by Sam Edwards, who served as one of the original creators of&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep&nbsp;</em>as part of Australian studio Beam Team Games.</p>
<p>As well as creating&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, the Prague team's responsibilities will also include the creation and support of "new games within the survival crafting space", which makes sense given North Beach's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria">pedigree as a developer</a>.</p>
<p>For his part, Edwards says he and Prague general manager&nbsp;Tomáš Pšenička are "super excited" to be working on&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2</em>, and that the goal for the game will be to "look to the future of the franchise and explore new horizons".</p>
<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2&nbsp;</em>will be made available "in the future", North Beach says. The studio will have a presence at this year's Gamescom, but it doesn't sound like more info about&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2&nbsp;</em>will be revealed during this month's show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-north-beach-games.jpg?itok=Z49QWiEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-north-beach-games.jpg?itok=1CGC3dZf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>North Beach's other games include&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever&nbsp;<em>Stranded Deep 2&nbsp;</em>turns out to be, we can only hope it'll be a more pleasurable experience than&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em>, of which our reviewer Robert <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-review-even-darkness-must-pass">was not a big fan</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things North Beach.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The way traditional Lego games have seemingly vanished has come as a surprise to me. We recently saw the launch of Lego Fortnite from Epic, and Lego Horizon Adventures is on the way this fall from Guerrilla, but Traveler's Tales made more than 30 Lego games between 2005 and 2022. However, it's been more than two years since the studio released a Lego game, and with no announcement of what's next, there's no guarantee it'll be another Lego project. This follows reports that making the most recent game in the franchise, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, demanded "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-delays-have-reportedly-led-to-extensive-crunch/1100-6499819/">extensive crunch</a>."</p><p dir="ltr">That's troubling for the studio's staff, but it also means there's a void to fill for families and players who enjoy the way Lego games routinely reimagine pop culture through a kid-friendly lens. Funko Fusion could comfortably fill that role when it arrives later this year.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Funko Fusion Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I recently played several hours of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/funko-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-569178">Funko Fusion</a>, spanning levels that re-imagined Jurassic World and Hot Fuzz, which do a great job expressing how varied the IP involved in this game will be. Even if you aren't a fan of the recent movies, Jurassic World is massive, which makes the addition of Hot Fuzz cool and unexpected. It's a cult classic, not a blockbuster, which means that in this way, Funko Fusion fulfills a role the Lego games never could, as they were always focused exclusively on top-tier franchises.</p><p dir="ltr">In gameplay terms, however, it's much like Traveler's Tales' decades of output, though it's most of all like The Skywalker Saga, as Funko Fusion is similarly played from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective. Each level drops you into a cartoonish take on the IP, meaning the Jurassic World levels had me running around the park as Chris Pratt's Owen, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire, and others, defeating hostile dinosaurs or rescuing friendly ones. The Hot Fuzz levels took me to the fictional Sandford, where I patrolled the streets as a big-headed version of Simon Pegg's character, Nicholas Angel.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko Fusion's playable characters include several for each IP. I don't have any affinity for the kitschy vinyl dolls in my life, but I admit that as a video game, they look lighthearted and fun. Their absurd dimensions also help the game lean into humor, like when Claire's big Funko Pop head gets stuck in a doorway as she runs away from a pack of dilophosaurus, and when enemies are defeated, they break into pieces like a real-life figure would if it were dropped from a roof.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment-to-moment gameplay is bright and fast, with button-mashy melee combat that players of all ages can quickly learn. There's a lot more shooting in Funko Fusion than in most Lego games, but customizable aim assist should allow even less experienced players to flourish here, too. I don't love that when the guns are fired, the bullets land as small red dots, seemingly made to look like vinyl niblets, which has the potentially unintended effect of looking like blood. That made me uncomfortable about a game I am otherwise excited to play with my kids. If those projectiles were multicolored, it would make them easier to stomach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4350303-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4350303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4350303-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4350303"></a><figcaption>Each level is spread out with enemies and puzzles all over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4350303-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When not defeating enemies, players are free to explore each hub world, smash up the environment to collect gems reminiscent of Lego studs, and solve minor puzzles. The Lego team always called these "nuzzles," as in "not puzzles," given their lack of complexity. Funko Fusion adopts a similar approach most of the time, though there were others that I actually found to be trickier than I expected, like a collection of water valves that needed to be returned to their pipes across a jungle level. These seemed to all be tied to a maintenance room I found, but because I never located the final valve, I don't know what secret the puzzle would've revealed to me, though I'd guess it was a crown.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the comically small crown the brand's mascot, Freddy Funko, wears at all times, crowns are effectively the game's primary collectible and a currency used for progression. A counter suggests there are hundreds of crowns in the full game. You can beat a level to unlock a crown, but by sticking around to do a level's optional side activities, you can earn many more, with about a half-dozen available in each level I played. These crowns allow you to unlock other levels in the game's hub world, so there may be times when you'll need to replay some earlier missions with a keener eye to unlock some of the later levels.</p><p dir="ltr">I hesitate to use the brand's name so repeatedly, but surely Lego fans can see how this all sounds familiar. Don't get me wrong; I don't mind it. Funko Fusion is standing on the shoulders of a particular giant in the family gaming space. Still, because of its wider swath of franchises to pull from, I'm most excited of all to see some rare and debuting video game versions of popular IP, like Universal Monsters, Shaun of the Dead, and even Jordan Peele's Nope.</p><p dir="ltr">The franchises announced for the game so far lean into horror quite a bit, so I'm curious, but largely unconcerned to see how this game's framework handles that. It seemingly can't help but sanitize pop culture landmarks such as Jaws, The Thing, and Child's Play, and as a big believer in gateway horror, I love that idea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4350304-funkofusion-hotfuzz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350304" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4350304-funkofusion-hotfuzz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350304"></a><figcaption>Like Hot Fuzz, Funko Fusion flanks its blockbuster franchises with more minor but still beloved movies and shows.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4350304-funkofusion-hotfuzz2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though my preview time with the game prevented me from playing co-op, the full release offers four-player online co-op, though no local play, unfortunately. That's too bad, as it means families will need to play in separate rooms, if at all, and many families have just one console or PC anyway. I saw one example of a puzzle that is doable in solo play, but just barely, whereas in bigger teams, it would've been much simpler, suggesting there's good reason to bring a friend or three each time you play.</p><p dir="ltr">That works for me, as I do subscribe to the adage that many or perhaps most games are better in co-op. Funko Fusion feels like it'll be such a game, and its lengthy tree of unlockable levels and characters means my family and I may be playing it for a long time to come.</p>

            <p>Destiny developer Bungie says it has addressed an issue where players have had their usernames changed by its "name moderation tool".</p>
<p>After "actively investigating" the issue for 24 hours, Bungie advised that while it had "identified the issue that was forcing a high number of Bungie name changes", it was "continuing to investigate" what happened and how "to address player accounts that were impacted".</p>

<p>Although Bungie acknowledged that a "high number of account names have been changed", the studio stopped short of confirming exactly how many players were affected.</p>
<p>Bungie now says it has applied a server-side change to "prevent the issue from impacting accounts moving forward". However, affected players will not have their original names reinstated - instead, they will be compensated by a name change token "at a later date".</p> <div>

</span></p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">Bungie recently issued a statement acknowledging concern over the future of its decade-old sci-fi franchise</a> following "recent changes" at the studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Sweeping layoffs saw 220 Bungie staff out of a job</a>, less than a year after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">further 100 employees were let go last October</a>.

The standard ex card could be a bit underwhelming, considering the price of this set. We're betting on the full art ex or the stunning Special Illustration Rare ex. It really is anyone's guess at the time of writing. Still, the SIR Terapagos ex has a unique rainbow border, making it a desirable chase card for the set. </p><p>The full art is still stunning, featuring Terapagos ex against a holo silver background with multicolored stars.

            <p>If you cast your minds back to October 2021, you may recall the news that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was set to make its way to the VR headset, Oculus Quest 2. While details on the project were thin on the ground at this time, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-is-coming-to-oculus-quest-2">said to have been "many years in the making"</a>.</p>
<p>However, not quite three years since that initial announcement, Meta has now said work on the VR port is "on hold indefinitely".</p>

<p>In response to a YouTube commenter inquiring as to the whereabouts of GTA: San Andreas VR, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAmNSjF9Big&amp;lc=UgwielXvTo--EHoQY7x4AaABAg.A77ZzS0z8DOA7A-RrmuyA-">official Meta Quest Vr account</a> replied: "GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects."</p>
<p>Meta then said it is "[looking] forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future". </p>
<p>In a further statement shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-san-andreas-vr-delayed-indefinitely-as-meta-focuses-on-other-projects">IGN</a>, Meta again confirmed the port is indefinitely on hold. No further elaboration was given, although this news is perhaps unsurprising. Many had already surmised the project had been quietly cancelled. </p>

<p>Meta had been tightlipped about this VR release for a while now. During its Connect conference in October last year, the company was asked by multiple publications for an update on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas VR's status, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-staying-quiet-on-status-of-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-vr">refrained from giving any particularly informative answers</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, all Meta said at that time was "no comment" or "we don't have any updates to share on GTA: San Andreas".</p>
<p>At least we still have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> on the horizon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Black: Myth: Wukong is a game that’s been in the minds of many since its announcement. From its staggeringly beautiful first reveal to the swirl of controversy and controversy-driven popularity surrounding its development, the latest adaptation of Journey to the West can’t stay out of the limelight.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - Final Trailer | Launching August 20, 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzyMLoSwYvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a huge fan of the Monkey King and a lot of the ways his story has been told in media, from Dragon Ball, Tower of God, and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, I’ve been looking forward to Black Myth: Wukong since I first saw it. That anticipation for this game was dampened significantly by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">the reports on deeply seated sexist attitude within the studio</a>, but they’re not going to be taken into account for this review. However, they definitely bear mentioning.</p>


<p>Black: Myth Wukong makes a strong, albeit slow, first impression. Scenery flies by as you fly through the sky to get into a fight I’m not allowed to talk about according to the embargo rules and then, you pick up with the actual story, and off you go. You charge through the trees learning more about how to play the game why you take out different monstrous enemies as you go, and quickly come across your first boss to slay. However, things go poorly no matter how well you do, and this is where you meet a dude who has roots growing out of his face, and is your Navi equivalent for the game. He’ll appear and guide you throughout, and help you find your next checkpoint, which are little shrines, along with explaining some mechanics, warning you about bosses, and teaching you the odd trick or two.</p>


<p>Combat is a blend of unleashing physical and magical attacks, with some dodging thrown in for good measure. It’s pretty fluid, and some of the spells are incredibly cool, along with basically all of the animations being like sugar for your eyes. The enemy designs are also exceptional, with fights in just the opening few hours including fox demons, a big old frog, and a werewolf-looking boss that definitely climbed out of Bloodborne.</p>
<p>However, and this is kind of a big deal for me, the action never <em>felt</em> anywhere near as good as it looked. No combination of new abilities, bosses, or anything else, managed to change that through the run of the game. I just don’t think the feel of Black Myth: Wukong is anywhere near the looks of the game, and for me, that’s a big issue. I’d always rather play a game that looked worse than it played, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>I’m also not 100% sure where the Soulslike comparisons came from for this game. I’ve played nearly every Soulslike that’s come out (including a bunch of games that I’d frankly rather never think about again), and while this game does have things like a checkpoint that can respawn enemies, that’s about as far as it goes. This is just an action game where sometimes the bosses are hard.</p>
<p>They certainly get tougher as you go on, but there’s none of the fear that Soulslikes instills, nor is there any pattern recognition that’s really needed to succeed. Your hero dodges very well, which meant that I took down a lot of bosses on my first or second try, with the second try often being because I’d messed about too much in the boss run and used up all of my resources. Again, they all look incredible, but that’s about it.</p>

<p>I found the story enjoyable overall though, which is good news if that’s your main worry. It’s hard not to find a story of magic and monkeys enjoyable though, even if all of the dialogue hams things up. That’s a compliment, just so we’re all clear, but I do also appreciate the it might mean it misses for some people.</p>

					<p>Black Myth: Wukong made more than a few heads turn with its reveal trailer released back in 2020, but it was with the switch to Unreal Engine 5 that the action role-playing game developed by Game Science entered most players' radars. With beautiful environments and highly detailed characters enhanced by the engine, Black Myth: Wukong promised to be one of the first truly next-gen action role-playing games.</p>
<p>Being from an unproven studio, many wondered if Game Science had what it takes to create a compelling action role-playing game experience. After spending around 25 hours with the game, I can say that they definitely did, although the game doesn't exactly try to innovate the genre, presenting an engaging but not particularly innovative blend of elements lifted from multiple Soulslikes, including the Team NINJA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh</a> series, CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter</a> and more traditional action games.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is based on Journey to the West, a novel published in China in the 16th century detailing the story of Sun Wukong, a monkey born from a stone who eventually learns the art of the tao, 72 transformations, combat techniques, and the secret of immortality. After becoming incredibly powerful, Sun Wukong challenges Heaven, only to fail and lose the artifacts that gave him power. Years after his defeat, the Destined One, who looks exactly like Sun Wukong, sets out to recover the artifacts that Sun Wukong had lost, getting to know more about the land and how the artifacts themselves have shaped the lives of those touched by them.</p>
<p>The Black Myth: Wukong story is a concise retelling of the traditional story, so those familiar with it will not be wholly surprised by the game's story. Being not a direct adaptation, however, there are still some surprises along the way which manage to make the experience entertaining even for those who are extremely familiar with Journey to the West. Story presentation also makes the journey enjoyable, as do the personable characters accompanying the Destined One. The writing is solid, going for a different tone depending on the character or the chapter, although it gets a little confusing at times. Some of these characters are clear standouts, like the main character of Chapter 2, who delights the Destined One and the player with some catchy tunes in Chinese, but every character is well realized for the amount of screen time they get. Competent English voiceovers compound the solid writing, although the original Chinese dub should be the one to go with for an authentic experience.</p>
<p>The Black Myth: Wukong story is possibly made more enjoyable by the great amount of care developer Game Science put into world-building. Though hidden inside the menu, the game provides tons of information on the many Yaoguai the Destined One faces on his journey, painting a very vivid picture of the beautiful world they inhabit. The main story bosses, in this regard, receive special treatment, thanks to an assortment of special cutscenes that play after their defeat, employing various animation techniques that ecthes them in the player's memory. The amount of love poured into the game's setting is evident, and the whole experience greatly benefits from it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240810142945_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the story may not be everyone's cup of tea, Black Myth: Wukong definitely delivers when it comes to gameplay, although it may feel a little lacking in depth compared to the games that inspired it. At its heart, the game is best described as a rather straightforward action game with elements lifted from the Souls series, such as stamina-based combat, bonfire-like checkpoints, dodge/rolling heavy defensive gameplay, and a main healing tool with multiple uses and some customization options like Elden Ring's Flask of Wondrous Physicks.</p>
<p>Unlike the Souls series, however, the Destined One can only use staves as the main weapon, which all come with the same moveset, which is comprised of a light combo string and a heavy attack that changes depending on the chosen stance. The stance, which can be switched on the fly, also changes the Varied Combo, which is a special combo initiated by using a heavy attack in the middle of a string.</p>
<p>Despite stances not altering the moveset a lot, they do make quite a difference. In Smash stance, for example, timing the Varied Combo to intercept an enemy attack will grant the Destined One increased staggering power, among other advantages that are unlocked via the dedicated skill trees, available for pretty much every combat tool. This is quite reminiscent of the counter-heavy playstyle of the Monster Hunter series Longsword. The Pillar stance, on the other hand, grants the Destined One the ability to climb on its extended staff to avoid ground attacks and deal massive damage from a safe position, while the Thrust stance gives access to attacks with longer range.</p>
<p>These powerful abilities are balanced out by the Focus system, which prevents spamming. By hitting the enemy with light attacks and with the staff spin maneuver, which also repels projectiles, Focus builds up to the point where a charge is stored. The more charges are stored, the more powerful the heavy attack will be, and the less time a heavy attack has to be charged to gain more Focus for better efficacy. Focus can also be gained via perfect dodges and other means, so there are different ways to play optimally despite the single basic moveset.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240810004928_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the Destined One can only use his staff as the main weapon, there are many other combat tools available, starting with spells. Belonging to three different types, these spells allow the Destined One to parry enemy attacks, immobilize enemies, create duplicates, and so on. These spells are rather powerful, and they are a central component in build-crafting together with the simple armor system, which grants different buffs depending on how many items from a set are equipped, similar to the Nioh series. Spirits, single attacks that can be unleashed by transforming into defeated enemies, also play a role in build-crafting, as they grant buffs that empower certain playstyles. Armor sets, alongside weapon upgrades that employ a weapon tree not too dissimilar from that seen in the Monster Hunter series, can be crafted from checkpoints using materials gathered on the field and special items obtained by defeating bosses.</p>
<p>Rounding up the combat tools available in Black Myth: Wukong are proper Transformations that turn the Destined One into one of the enemies he has defeated for a prolonged amount of time, giving access to different movesets and abilities. These, like spells, have cooldown timers, so it is impossible to spam them repeatedly to win. Not that it is really needed, as Black Myth: Wukong is not a very difficult game. Most mobs are not a threat at all, and most bosses can be defeated the first time through, with only a few exceptions. Even then, a couple of tries should be more than enough for experienced action game players.</p>
<p>While this may sound disappointing, I've found Black Myth: Wukong's approach to difficulty refreshing. Though enemy placement and certain movesets are reminiscent of the Souls series, none reach the frustrating difficulty of many of the enemies in Elden Ring, whose boss design gets really extreme sometimes. Here, no boss will unleash an arena-wide attack with multiple swings that must be avoided with very strict timing or deliver a cheap kill all of a sudden. Considering how much I was frustrated by some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> bosses, I really welcomed this approach, which still kept me on my toes but never made me feel like I was at a huge disadvantage, no matter what I did. The fact that regular enemy design is super varied and the main boss design is extremely good makes it all the easier to forgive the game for an experience that is, maybe, too little challenging at times.</p>
<p>Level design is also competent, although not particularly inspired. The game's very first chapter doesn't leave a very good impression, featuring a mostly linear design, but things improve greatly from the second chapter onward, as locations become bigger and feature multiple paths, many of them including additional items for crafting weapons and gear, and Mind Cores, which are used to craft a special type of medicine unlocked in late Chapter 2 which grants permanent stat boosts, introducing a sort of Soulslike leveling system, and optional bosses, of which there are quite a few, and some can only be found with some thorough searching and with specific items. Some of them are variants of other bosses, unfortunately, but it is to be expected when having so many of them. Even when the level design gets a bit more open, it definitely does not reach the heights of the interconnectivity that characterized Lordran in the original Dark Souls.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240811131949_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Exploration is also limited, with very little verticality, which is surprising given the Destined One's agility, and too many closed-off paths that look explorable at a glance, making it one of the less rewarding aspects of the game. That said, there are still plenty of secrets to be found for those looking for them. These secrets also extend the game's total playtime well past the 25 hours needed to complete the main campaign, though this number may vary depending on the player's skill.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Black Myth: Wukong looks great. Character models look highly detailed, while the environments succeed at fusing together natural landscapes with traditional Chinese architecture, giving the game a very charming atmosphere. The game, sadly, is not without some visual glitches, as I often experienced vegetation shadow flickering, which was a bit distracting. With full ray tracing support, the Black Myth: Wukong visuals get elevated to the next level with better shadows and reflections, but the improvements are, in my opinion, not really worth it due to the performance cost, which is rather big.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Black Myth Wukong PC 4K Gameplay [DLSS Balanced, No RT]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NMN_vaoD9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As many expected, Black Myth: Wukong sadly suffers from some performance issues, namely the stuttering issues that are sadly common in every current Unreal Engine 5 game. While the game attempts to reduce stuttering by pre-caching shaders before it launches for the first time, traversal stutters are still in. They are very frequent and sometimes very distracting, as some of them last for over one second, which is a massive problem when in combat. As such, I've found the benchmark tool a little misleading, as it shows no stuttering at all.</p>
<p>Generally, however, it is a decent enough representation of the performance you should expect during most of the game, minus the traversal stutters. Don't expect to be able to play the game decently at native resolution with everything maxed out and full ray tracing, however, as my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM] couldn't average 60 FPS even at 1080p resolution. Thankfully, the game supports all three upscalers (DLSS, FSR, XeSS) alongside UE5's TSR (which looks worse than the others) and DLSS Frame Generation, so with some tweaking of the settings and NVIDIA DLSS at balanced, my system averaged 115 FPS in the benchmark. I could have gone with DLSS Quality for better image quality and run the game at around 90 FPS average, but for a fast-paced game like Black Myth: Wukong, I preferred prioritizing framerate.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong couldn't have been a better debut for Game Science. Although their action role-playing game may not be innovative, it's got great production values, it's fun to play, it's engaging, and it's beautiful to look at. Some minor issues, such as a challenge level that could be too low for some and an experience that gets a little stale over time, hold back the game a bit, but in all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised to see more than a few players name Black Myth: Wukong their Game of the Year.</p>
<p><em>PC version tested. Review code provided by the publisher.</em></p>

					
					

<p>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-mod-shut-down-activision<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has hit a popular&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered&nbsp;</em>mod with a cease and desist order just one day before the mod was due to launch.</p>
<p>The H2 Multiplayer Mod, which would have introduced&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>content into the base&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare Remastered</em>, <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1824167247436542167" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced yesterday</a> that Activision had issued a cease and desist order and that the mod's creators intended to comply with it.</p>
<p>That means the mod will "[shut] down all operations immediately and permanently", so if you were looking forward to checking out some of&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2</em>'s multiplayer gameplay on modern systems, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-mw2.jpg?itok=xcxEBDxS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-mw2.jpg?itok=jGo1Vfff 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Modern Warfare 2</em>'s campaign has been remastered, but its multiplayer has been left in the past, which this mod was aiming to fix.</figcaption></figure><p>The H2M mod was intended to bring&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2</em>'s maps and multiplayer gameplay into&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare Remastered</em>, owing to the lack of a multiplayer mode in 2020's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered&nbsp;</em>(the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-announcement-surprises-no-one">clue's in the name</a>, I suppose).</p>
<p>It would have introduced new progression elements, attachments, and more to&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare Remastered</em>, as well as bringing in&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2</em>'s original killstreak bonuses, creating an experience akin to&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2</em>'s multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like it was not to be. We don't know exactly why Activision issued the cease and desist order, but given that the mod would have used&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2&nbsp;</em>assets, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered&nbsp;</em>is more than four years old now, it's unlikely that the original 2009 game's multiplayer modes will be reintroduced to the package, so you'll have to content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare Remastered</em>'s multiplayer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-price.jpg?itok=qfR5vPLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-price.jpg?itok=Dqy-adx8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least you can still play&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</em>'s multiplayer modes.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can probably expect, this cease and desist has resulted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/393080/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_Remastered_2017/#app_reviews_hash">massive review bomb</a> for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered&nbsp;</em>on Steam, which is now sitting at an Overwhelmingly Negative user rating.</p>
<p>Lest you wonder whether H2M is the cause, many recent reviews directly reference it, and others simply refer to Activision as "greedy" or "evil", so it's not hard to guess what that's in relation to.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's unlikely that Activision will reverse its decision, so you might just have to get your&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>multiplayer kicks elsewhere. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>

                <p>Once you've flown a couple of times, airline safety videos are usually boring enough to easily ignore (although you <em>really </em>shouldn't). But a video featuring Pikachu and several other Pokemon teaching you proper airplane safety rules? Now that's an attention-grabber. All Nippon Airways and The Pokemon Company have teamed up to instruct passengers how to stay safe on aircraft, and the result is an adorable collaboration you'll want to watch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAolvci7SeA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SAolvci7SeA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video above has some pretty great cameos from various Pokemon, like Farfetch'd's tiny leek stick luggage taking up far too much space in the overhead compartment, Pikachu observing the seatbelt rule, and a Jigglypuff looking like it's ready to assault a vaper. This is all the information you'd typically expect from an airline video and staff before taking off, but the blend of live-action actors and Pokemon makes it both cute and educational. The video will be played aboard the special <a href="https://www.ana.co.jp/en/jp/international/theme/pikachujet/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Air Adventures aircraft</a> from the ANA fleet, which are two airplanes decorated with Pikachu and Eevee designs.</p><p>ANA isn't the only airline to adopt a more-interesting approach to teaching passengers the rules of the air, as <a href="https://youtu.be/qOw44VFNk8Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Air New Zealand has several cool videos with a Middle-earth influence</a>. Back on solid ground, Pokemon fans can look forward to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A in 2025</a>. While only a few details on the game have been shared so far, it looks like players will be traveling to Lumiose City in Kalos from Pokemon X and Y when the game is eventually released.</p>

                <p>Activision has shut down a highly anticipated Call of Duty mod, just hours before it was due to release. The mod, H2M, was billed as a remastering of the original Modern Warfare II multiplayer experience, delivering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-cod-modern-warfare-2-remastered-lacks-multipla/1100-6475496/" data-ref-id="1100-6475496">what Activision itself did not</a>. But it's not going to happen. As fans feared, Activision issued a cease and desist order to the developers, just like the company did with the <a href="https://x.com/sm2game/status/1658745182819598337" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fan-made Call of Duty SM2 mod in 2023.</a></p><p>"We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently," the developers said. The order to shut it down came on August 15, just a day before the modders were due to release the H2M mod on August 16.</p><p>The mod would have required a copy of 2017's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. In anticipation of the mod's release, sales of Modern Warfare Remastered rose significantly on Steam. After the news about the cease and desist order came out, however, players <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK_/status/1824199921093722282" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">review-bombed Modern Warfare Remastered</a>, turning its recent reviews rating to "mostly negative."</p><p>Modern Warfare Remastered recently went on sale on Steam, prompting people to speculate that Activision was trying to capitalize on interest in H2M.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-crush-house-is-a-hectic-take-on-reality-tv.955005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/crush-house-impressions-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a huge fan of reality TV (with the exception of <a href="https://go.tlc.com/show/sister-wives-tlc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sister Wives</em></a> because it’s about religion), so I wasn’t sure recent game <a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/the-crush-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Crush House</em></a> would be my thing. But the game is less about cringing at other people’s drama and more about what it’s like to use the core mechanic of filming that drama to explore what stands between a reality show's subjects and their audience.</p><p><em>The Crush House</em>, which came out last week, casts you as Jae, a producer on a reality show. You select a cast of four characters and then film them living in a glitzy mansion together, keeping different audiences satisfied enough to keep the show from getting cancelled. If you make it through a week-long season, the cast goes home, and then you start over with a new cast of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Crush House | Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHdOX9XpWJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s an underlying plot about things not being quite what they seem in the titular Crush House. To move that story forward, you need to do on-the-side tasks for cast members, which can’t necessarily be completed in one season of the show. This adds some structure to your repeated runs, but I could also find it a little annoying when I had to bring back cast members across seasons just to knock out their goals. But this also brings in <em>The Crush House</em>’s first layer of strategy: if I need to film softboi Milo making friends and enemies, I have to pick other cast members likely to form those relationships with him, like the sunny Charlie or the pretentious Gunther.&nbsp;</p><p>This cast makeup also matters for the audiences you have to satisfy to keep the show from getting cancelled. Every morning, you get a growing list of viewers with particular desires. Some are straightforward: Butt Guys want to see butts, and Plumbers want to see the house’s water fixtures. Voyeurs want to see the cast filmed from faraway, creepy angles, and Film Students want to see fancy shots. But other audiences can be harder to please, with unclear desires–what the hell do The Glitched or Nursing Home residents like?--or reliant on the cast doing things you may or may not be able to engineer. Divorced Dads want to see men bonding, so you’ll need male cast members likely to bond; Drama Queens want to see people fighting, so you’ll need cast members likely to clash.</p><p>Since you don’t know what audiences you’ll get when you’re picking a cast at the start of the season, this can be tough– once, I found myself needing to satisfy Girls for Girls fans when I had a cast full of boys. Luckily, fully satisfied audiences’ enthusiasm will leak over to other audiences, helping you make up the gaps. And you can also buy props, using money you get from ads Jae runs when she’s not filming, to make cast members more likely to engage in certain behaviors or to help satisfy audiences–Divorced Dads will be happy to look at the grill if you don’t have male cast members who are friends. But props can be expensive, and time spent running ads means time not filming, making each day a hectic balancing act.</p><p>Eventually, you’ll see all the audiences and know what they want, but the game felt the most fun to me when I’d get a brand-new audience and rush frantically around the house aiming my camera at everything to try to figure out what they wanted to see. There’s a thrill to staring down five audiences late into a season, with some wanting to see the garden, others wanting to see two characters fighting by the pool, and <em>others</em> wanting to see my cast full of enemies impossibly be friends. All this leaves me running back and forth, squeezing ads into the transition, hoping I make it to the end of the day.</p><p>At the same time, all this really boils down to just swinging your camera around until various icons appear on the screen, with the actual cast and their lives becoming secondary. I’m not sure if <em>The Crush House</em> wants you to be engaged in casts’ lives and desires, the way an actual reality TV audience is meant to, or if the game’s mechanics are meant to make you see them as just means to an end, number-go-up generators that keep the show going, the way the game’s deeper plot suggests. Most likely, it’s meant to be both–not so much to make a statement about reality TV as to situate you in that tension at its heart. I often felt like I had largely missed the actual relationships between people in a season, engaged in swinging between shots of the offshore lighthouse and a branded juice machine to give my audiences what they wanted while actual human drama went on out of frame.</p><p>I found the game more mechanically fun than I found it narratively engaging, but that’s not a bad thing. Each day felt stressful and exciting as I grew familiar with the best vantage points in the house or the perfect camera angle, squeezing in an ad or two to work toward a prop as I noticed drama stewing or romance about to ensue. Failure means starting a day over, and you can also set the difficulty so that the show is never cancelled, meaning the stakes are never high enough to make the game too frustrating if you’re unlucky with your audiences or cast. The core thing you do in the game is enjoyable, even if it’s not all that deep.</p><p>I’m enjoying the way <em>The Crush House</em> scratches a certain roguelike itch I have; I've seen other reviews liken it to a twist on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/09/the-crush-house-review-love-island-with-a-dark-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person shooter</a>, which is another fun way to look at it. Each day is a jumble of conflicting demands, a combination of repetition and randomness that I steadily master, selectively choosing from realities on offer while filming a lot of faucets and video game character butts along the way. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-being-separated-from-premium-call-of-duty-games.954999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warzone-being-separated-from-premium-call-of-duty-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an attempt to reduce the increasingly large download size of Call of Duty games, Warzone is being officially separated from premium <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-recieves-h2m-mod/">Call of Duty</a> games. The Activision developers are gearing up to make significant changes to the Call of Duty HQ launcher on PC, so those interested in Warzone can only download files specifically for Warzone.</p>
<p>To allow this huge event to happen, they are slowly and carefully rolling out the new updates to the launcher. This is not only to ensure that things don't break along the way but also to reduce the install size of the other Call of Duty games by any amount. To ensure that the games are reduced in size, Activision will expand its stream tech and add more content to the streaming pool instead.</p>
<p>Doing this means that they will cycle the less frequently used content in the streaming cache and continue to expand what content can be streamed in general to lessen the load on the players. One part of this is the "On-Demand Texture Streaming" option, which will be changed to "On-Demand High Quality Streaming." While that may not sound too different from what it is now, there will be two options for players to utilize. One of the options will prioritize higher fidelity graphics that require more bandwidth, while the other forgoes graphical quality and uses less bandwidth.</p>
<p>By doing this mass revamp, they hope it will make other games on the launcher easier to access, with players only having to download specifically what they want to play. Unfortunately for some, players must download bigger files to pave the way for smaller download sizes. This is a lengthy process that Activision will be sinking a lot of time into.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 users are most likely going to be the unhappiest of them all, as they will have to download four separate chunks in Season 5 Reloaded. This includes the initial system-level update and three more that are triggered by opening Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. However, this is currently only necessary for current players who are playing now and continuing to keep up with the latest iterations of the franchise. Those completely new to the franchise won't have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Activision has<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap#:~:text=texture%20streaming%20tech-,Separating%20Call%20of%20Duty%3A%20Warzone%20from%20the%20default%20download%20for,for%20that%20game%20by%20default." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted its schedule for the big revamp</a> and is making way for Black Ops 6. Below is the schedule people can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganizing game content, part of the Season 5 Reloaded update (August 21)</li>
<li>Black Ops 6 Open Beta (August 30)</li>
<li>New User Interface (Mid-October)</li>
<li>Black Ops 6 Launch (October 25)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, anyone who logs in after the Season 5 Reloaded update will get a package of Battle Pass Tier Skips and Double XP Tokens. As a reminder, Black Ops 6 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on day one via Game Pass.</p>

<p>The tool will be released on Wednesday, August 21st, and will be available until August 26th, so you'll have five days to make your Zoi. Once the character is made, you'll then be able to use them in&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>"post Early Access launch".</p>
<p>This is very much the full&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>character creation tool; it'll come complete with "over 250 customization options", from hair, facial features, and complexion all the way to fingernails and more. As Krafton says, you're "limited only by [your] imagination".</p>

Weirdly,&nbsp;<em>InZoi</em>'s Steam page doesn't disclose its use of generative AI, which would, I think, technically be a contravention of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam's AI rules</a>.</p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-changes-rules-on-ai-to-allow-vast-majority-of-games-that-use-it">does allow</a> games listed on its store to use AI, but said games are required to disclose its inclusion, whether the AI content is pre-generated or live-generated. We'll have to wait and see whether the&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>character creator bears such a disclaimer when it arrives.</p>
<p>Once you've created your Zoi, you can then upload them to the built-in user-generated content platform Canvas, where other users can download them and leave a like if they think your Zoi is cool. You'd better make them the best Zoi they can be!</p>

<p>The game revolves around the lives of its characters, known as Zois, as they build relationships, get jobs, and generally live out their lives. Just like in&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, you'll be able to shape their stories, build their homes, and watch as they interact with one another.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">cancellation of Paradox's&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em></a> (and the subsequent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled">blow it dealt to the studio's finances</a>),&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>is one of the only serious&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitors that remains in active development. We'll have to wait and see whether it manages to challenge EA for the life sim crown, though.</p>

<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40083/goat-simulator-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB website</a>, Coffee Stain North’s Goat Simulator 3 now has a new rating for the Nintendo Switch platform. As expected, it earned a T rating for crude humor, language, and violence. </p>



<p>The rating confirms recent rumors about a Nintendo Switch version. A listing on Amazon Japan surfaced online for the new Switch version not long ago, though the site promptly took that page down.</p>



<p>Before Amazon Japan removed the listing, fans noticed a potential release date of November 7, 2024. However, neither developer Coffee Stain North nor Nintendo have confirmed a concrete release date. </p>

<p>An official Nintendo Switch release date announcement should arrive fairly soon now that Goat Simulator 3 has an ESRB rating.</p>



<p>Most recently, Coffee Stain North released Goat Simulator 3 – Multiverse of Nonsense DLC for the base game on June 19, 2024. The DLC earned ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam. It added 8 new playable goats, a brand-new map, over 100 new gears, and more.</p>



<p>In April 2024, Embracer Group announced plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split into three companies</a>, one of which is Coffee Stain &amp; Friends. That company will focus on a range of Premium and Free to Play PC, console, and mobile games.</p>



<p>Goat Simulator 3 first launched in 2022, and is available now on mobile, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>
