            <p>Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-delays-sims-like-life-by-you-again-but-wont-commit-to-a-new-release-date">multiple delays</a>, Paradox Interactive has cancelled its Sim-like game, Life By You.</p>
<p>Announcing the cancellation last night, deputy CEO <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">Mattias Lilja</a> called this decision "difficult", stating it was a "clear failure on Paradox's part to meet both our own and the community's expectations".</p>
<p>Lilja went on to explain why the studio ultimately decided to cancel its release, rather than continuing to delay Life by You further. The exec said while "a time extension was an option", it eventually became clear "the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain".</p>

<p>"This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realising them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop," the deputy CEO wrote.</p>
<p>Lilja said Life by You's cancellation was "tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project", particularly given how far into the process the game was.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay," Paradox's exec continued.</p>
<p>"So, how do we ensure we don't find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we'll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn't reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we'll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that."</p> <div>

<p>It has been a rough time for Paradox recently. In addition to news of Life by You's cancellation, back in April, the company along with developer Colossal Order issued a stark apology for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">state of Cities: Skylines 2</a> and the release of its recent DLC, admitting to fans: "We let you down". The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">companies refunded those who purchased the DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">Paradox parted ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> after nine years. It cited not being able to "find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties" as the reason for this split.</p>

            <p>You forgot about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/habbo-hotel">Habbo Hotel</a>, didn't you? Habbo Hotel. With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. "Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.</p>
<p>Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, sorry. In an act that will make grown adults across the western world cry out as they inspect their own faces in mirrors and understand that time is both vaprous and immutable, the developers of Habbo are relaunching the oldest version of Habbo Hotel they have. </p>
<p>"After discovering an old decrepit server with some long-lost files at the beginning of this year," say <a href="https://www.habbo.com/community/article/34151/launching-tomorrow-habbo-hotel-origins">the Habbolords in a news post</a>, "...long-time Habbo developer and player Macklebee has lovingly restored an old version of Habbo Hotel first released in 2005."</p>
<p>They are launching the minigame-filled virtual chatland today, and have posted a short video <a href="https://x.com/Habbo/status/1802656425790906650">promoting it on Xitter</a>, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180314/habbo-hotel-2005-origins-release">noticed by Polygon</a>. This will be "an iconic version of an iconic game with a fresh, community-led approach," they say. The community-led bit refers to what the developers are doing in one area of the game, which will become "a kind of democratic forum where we will ask important questions about the development and direction of Habbo." Players will be able to vote on whatever is discussed, and the decisions, we're told, will be binding. Experience tells me there will be limits to this. Direct cyberdemocracy does not always go smoothly. </p>
<p>For anyone deeply confused about Habbo history, I have previously written about the game as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-habbo-hotel">currency-obsessed realm of baseball caps and virtual materialism</a>. It is a bit like proto-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>. Both in that it shares a target audience of children and has seemingly no logic to its dreamlike world(s). It is free-to-play but is not, I  emphasise, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">best free games</a>.</p>

			<p>Starfield can be made to run at 120 frames per second on Xbox Series S, although with some compromises in visual quality that some may not be ready to make.</p>
<p>As shown by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FuzionXboxTesting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzion Xbox Testing</a> in a new video, the latest role-playing game by Bethesda can hit the 120 FPS mark in some scenarios on the Xbox Series S with the help of a few mods, such as Uncap FPS for Series S, Performance Tweaks, Performance Shadows, Remove Grass, Crowd Reducer and No God Rays. Even with the resolution reduced to 720p by the Performance Tweaks mod and the turning down of multiple graphics settings, the console can't keep a steady framerate, so the experience won't be exactly smooth, but it is definitely worth a try, even just to experience high framerate gameplay on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-scope-impacted-xbox-series-s-4k-30-fps/">weakest current generation console.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: 60FPS/120FPS Update/Mod - Xbox Series S Gameplay + FPS Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hNneSYUbn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release last year, Starfield was regularly updated with new features and content, the latest of which was the Creation Club. The first big expansion, Shattered Space, will launch later this year and will allow players to experience <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/">a new story set on a single planet around the size of Fallout 4's Far Harbor expansion</a>, which requires around 15 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-the-games-industry-needs-to-show-some-patience<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The industry veteran shares his views on the current state of the video games business</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Tencent advisor and former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has criticised the games industry's lack of patience during this period of widespread layoffs.</p>
<p>Layden's comments came during the opening podcast for GI Sprint, which is a new series of videos, podcasts and articles around the subject of making video games cheaper, faster and better. The full podcast goes live later today.</p>
<p>The current industry situation, which has seen tens of thousands of redundancies across the business, has been caused by slow growth and rapidly rising costs. And Layden says a side effect has been impatience from games companies when it comes to new ideas and concepts.</p>
<p>"That's the real frustrating thing when you see people say 'look here's a small studio that made a great game, it has true promise, it created an entirely new gaming experience, but we don't have the patience to play this thing out into part two or part three'," he began.</p>
<p>"Even though they didn't really get wiped out by it, they didn't have the windfall profits they expected and so they just kill this thing and go for more established AAA IP, sequels, copycats, and things that from a financial perspective you can draw a through line and say if we build this game it likely perform like this in the market. When you bring completely new things that people have not seen before, which may be fantastic and quite often are, the publishing industry doesn't have patience now to nurture these things, and they feel they need the quick big win. And that's a terrible place to be in an entertainment and creative industry."</p>
<p>Layden says it is ultimately the new ideas that will be what gets the industry – particularly the AAA console industry - out of its current predicament, not established brands and franchises.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of the planet has already said Grand Theft Auto is not that interesting, Call of Duty is not that interesting," Layden says. "They were both huge hits in our in our little village of gamers, of course.</p>
<p>"If people have already said they're not interested in that experience, building more of those experiences will not get them in. It seems pretty axiomatic to me."</p>
<p>He continues: "How does the entertainment industry continue to grow and expand and reach new people? And to my mind that's through innovation and through bringing out new kinds of games. So okay, you don't like first-person shooters and you don't like RPGs, here's something else, here's a rhythm action gaming piece that's all about music and bright colours and having a good time. Where's the space for those games? And how do we continue to provide outreach to get new people involved in the interactive entertainment world?"</p>
<blockquote><p>"We went through this time of artificial growth during the pandemic, and I would have expected more companies to recognize that it was a limited time party"</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds that patience works both ways, too. Game companies need to show patience when nurturing new ideas, but also patience when reacting to what's going on in the market, citing the industry's over-excitement during the lockdown years.</p>
<p>"We went through this time of artificial growth during the pandemic, and I would have expected more companies to recognize that this is a very limited time party people," he tells us. "Make hay while the sun shines, but don't make huge investments against what you think is a never ending 20% growth rate year on year, because that's not continuing. But people got excited in the moment. They didn't want to miss the opportunity, and so you bulk up. None of us knew how long the pandemic was going to last or lockdown was going to last, so I guess you do make investments to try to jump on the potential that that may be longer than it turned out to be. But that's a huge gamble. You're betting on the comet, and if it doesn't happen then you're stuck out of position with a huge labour load.</p>
<p>He continues: "It's human nature, right? If you're at the craps table and someone's got the hot hand and they're running the table… you just want to jump on that train and get a piece of that before it goes. That's why patience is the thing that's important. The industry is losing patience. It's 'we need to find a way to solve this problem in six months' in an industry where nothing gets done in six months.</p>
<p>Layden says it's ultimately the smaller studios and companies who suffer the most, who may have been acquired during this period of excess with the promise of creative freedom, only to find themselves having to cut back because of growth concerns by their parent company.</p>
<p>"They say we love the creatives and we're going to let them do their thing and build the great games. 'You're the experts on that, we just want to help you realize your goal'. That's fine and good. But the minute the money thing gets a bit tight across the whole enterprise, all of a sudden the companies come back to all the studios and say we're in a tough spot, we're going to miss are profitability targets, so everybody's got to take a haircut," Layden explains. "And some of the smallest studios are going: 'why do I need the haircut? You bought me for a little bit of money to give me some freedom to do the thing I do… I didn't tell you to spend double digit billions of dollars on buying other stuff, which means all of a sudden we will be the sacrificial lamb because you've got to make that balance sheet work.'</p>
<p>"It's not a true offer when they say: 'we're going to buy you and give you all of your autonomy… unless, of course, our other financial agencies force us to close you'."</p>

            <p>
The sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie now has a firm 2026 release date.
</p>
<p>
In a "this is Miyamoto" social post ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-with-us">today's Nintendo Direct</a>, the Mario creator revealed the full release date for the animated film sequel: 24th April 2026, in Japan.
</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2024/240618.html">Nintendo</a> also stated it will be released earlier in the US, 3rd April 2026, with "other countries and regions" during April 2026.

Once again, the sequel will be co-produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri and Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto, with Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic directing, and a script from Matthew Fogel.

The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Super Mario Bros. Movie was a huge success for Nintendo</a>, earning $500m globally to become the biggest video game film adaptation ever.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-2026">Nintendo announced the 2026 release for the sequel</a> back on Mario Day in March this year, but now we have an exact date.

</p>
<p>
"We've come a long way from Bowser's brief cameo in Wreck-It Ralph, when Nintendo famously gave notes on the correct way for Disney's animators to show Bowser holding a teacup," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-review-an-entertaining-advert-for-everything-nintendo">Eurogamer's thoughts on The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.

</p>
<p>
"Illumination's version of this world, made hand-in-white-glove with Miyamoto himself, undoubtedly allows for more freedom - though, perhaps unusually for Miyamoto, steadfastly refuses to upset the tea table itself."

            <p>
Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the "same" money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.</p>
<p>This was my Big Short, my Money Ball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are <em>finally</em> getting to the point here - has just been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146170/Baten_Kaitos_I__II_HD_Remaster/">rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster</a>. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

Our hard-beset guides writer Jeremy Blum <em>did</em> play Baten Kaitos properly as a youth, but he can't write this post because he's caught in the anaconda coils of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> tips-writing (I hear there's some kind of expansion out this week?) so you'll have to settle for my sparse memories and what I can glean from the Steam page. Battle-system-wise, Baten Kaitos is notable for smushing together active-timey combat with card-battling - the essence of your items and abilities are stored inside Magnus cards which are played in real time. I think the CG/real-time mash-up was what had me hurrying back to Gamestation originally - it takes some time to bed in. I'm interested to experience/hear about how it measures up in today's world, where role-playing card games are as abundant as dandruff.</p>
<p>The plot, meanwhile, casts you as a guardian spirit shepherding a party of destiny-defiers through a luxuriant, organic landscape not worlds away from Final Fantasy X's Spira or the archipelago of Chrono Cross. As for what the remasters add, here's a bullet point rundown care of our indispensable ally Mr Blockquote. If Mr Blockquote's insights aren't enough for you, the console versions of the remasters from last year were <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/14927-baten-kaitos-i-ii-hd-remaster-review">pretty positively reviewed</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The two titles have been fully remastered in HD, including retouched battle backgrounds, character graphics, and UI.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy Baten Kaitos with even more vibrant visuals.
</p>
<p>
・ Aspect ratio expanded from 4:3 to 16:9 for play on wider screens!
</p>
<p>
・ Main character and boss graphics have been completely renewed in vivid detail!
</p>
<p>
・ All-new menu screens! Enjoy smoother gameplay with refreshed menu layouts, newly added sorting features, and more.
</p>
<p>
Pre-existing graphics have been used for in-game maps as well as some screens and character models.
</p>
<p>
• New Features for Better Gameplay
</p>
<p>
Along with improved graphics, the features below have been added to make game progression much smoother!
</p>
<p>
・ Auto-save feature
</p>
<p>
・ Help menu containing terminology and hints for progressing through the game
</p>
<p>
・ New Game+ mode, unlocked after clearing the game once, which starts a new game while retaining all magnus, levels, and ranks
</p>
<p>
・ New Game- mode, a mode with level restrictions for an extra thrilling challenge
</p>
<p>
Six new game system options have now been added, including adjustable game speeds and no-encounter mode.
</p>
<p>
Save your settings as a Custom Set and turn them on or off at any time. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's currently selling for £40.49, $44.99 or 44,99€ with a 10% launch discount. Back in the early noughties I'd have gotten at least four game purchases out of that money, but alas, Gamestation is dust, though I guess there's still the terrible temptation of exploiting that two-hour refund window on Steam. Get ye behind me, Satan!

            <p>Life By You, the Sims-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> previously troubled by several delays, has been canceled by Paradox Interactive, and Californian studio Paradox Tectonic have been shut down. The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">forum post</a>, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/following-life-by-you-cancellation-paradox-interactive-closes-paradox-tectonic">GameWatcher</a>.</p>

<p>“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” said Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester, in the manner of a CEO making what’s increasingly looking like the sort of decision such people in the game industry don’t actually find all that difficult to make. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project, we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio,” he said, echoing the refrain used by such people in the game industry who don’t actually seem to consider such a decision all that tough.</p>
<p>In last year’s <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/year-end-report-january-december-2023">financial report</a>, Paradox Interactive <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/paradox-financials-2023">reported record revenue</a>, but a decrease in profits. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> made them big bucks in the last quarter, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">despite launch woes</a>. On the other end of the spectrum, there was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$23 million flop</a> of strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lamplighters-league">The Lamplighters League</a>, prior to which they laid off a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paradox-to-write-down-lamplighters-league-costs-confirms-layoffs-at-harebrained-schemes">“significant portion” of studio Harebrained Schemes</a>, who they then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">cut loose</a> last October.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a> itself has been subject to several delays leading up to this point, the most recent being an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">indefinite delay</a> back in March. The game was originally set to launch at the start of this month, on the 4th of June. Last August, Katharine (RPS peace) found a demo of the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-humans-are-always-watching-you-and-some-of-them-can-be-real-creepy-about-it">quite promising</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all affected in what has become a saddening and frustratingly common occurrence for developers of late. Just this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-shut-down-alone-in-the-dark-rebooters-pieces-interactive-creators-of-magicka-and-titan-quest-dlcs">Embracer shut down</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alone-in-the-dark">Alone In The Dark</a> reboot studio Pieces Interactive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-rival-ufl-sets-impressive-player-numbers-in-open-beta-weekend/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ea-fc-24-rival-ufl-sets-impressive-player-numbers-in-open-beta-weekend<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It looks like <em>EA FC 24</em> might actually have a true competitor on their hands, with STRIKERZ INC revealing that over one million players jumped onto the pitch for <em>UFL</em>‘s first open beta weekend. </p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">According to STRIKERZ, 1,320,000 players downloaded the beta and created their club, with over 5.5 million minutes played and 9,986,206 goals scored—not bad for <em>UFL</em>‘s first public outing. It’s no surprise that the football-mad nations of the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Germany led the way in player numbers, with the United States and France filling out the top five. </p> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">It also should come as a shock that the most popular player in the beta was <em>UFL</em>‘s frontman Cristiano Ronaldo. Truthfully, it was never going to be anyone else. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just 1 week since UFL Open Beta ended but we already miss you!<br>⠀<br>Still can’t believe 1.3 million passionate players gathered over the weekend. Wow 🔥<br>⠀<br>What an amazing Community!<br>Thanks for your participation &amp; feedback ✊<br>⠀<br>Updates on our summer plans coming soon. Stay tuned!… <a href="https://t.co/6hGhtxCEhD">pic.twitter.com/6hGhtxCEhD</a></p>— UFL (@UFLgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/UFLgame/status/1802703560414474517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">As for the <a href="https://www.charlieintel.com/ea-sports-fc/how-many-people-play-ea-fc-24-november-2023-player-count-280147/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beta</a> itself, reviews have been pretty positive. The Ultimate Team-style game is definitely not as polished as <em>EA FC 24</em>, but it definitely feels nice to play, and is a solid foundation for STRIKERZ to build on. While the numbers are impressive for one weekend, it’s worth remembering that EA Sports’ soccer offering <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-pulls-in-11-million-users-during-debut-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly logged 11.3 million users</a> in its first week, so there’s a long way to go to reign in <em>EA FC</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Still, it’s nice to see some actual competition in the football market. Konami’s decision to kill the <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em> series and replace it with <em>eFootball</em> essentially killed all of its momentum, leaving <em>FIFA</em> and then <em>EA FC</em> to become the undisputed king of the genre. </p> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="false">With <em>UFL</em> now making waves, and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/leak-claims-2k-sports-working-on-new-fifa-game-releasing-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored <em>FIFA </em>game developed</a> by 2K, we might finally have a fight on our hands for the top spot, and the competition may push EA Sports to make major improvements to their franchise.</p>

			<p>Elden Ring might have received a perfect score from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech</a> and many other outlets, ending up with tons of Game of the Year awards in 2022, but that doesn't mean it's the ideal fantasy RPG for creator Hidetaka Miyazaki. FromSoftware's president <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/im-still-in-the-process-of-making-my-ideal-fantasy-rpg-says-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazaki-while-elden-ring-is-not-quite-it-its-getting-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> PC Gamer that it's pretty close, but there's still room for improvement. He also wishes someone else would make it instead - that way, he could enjoy it as a player without knowing every single element in the game.</p>
<p><em>You might say that trying to capture the excitement of those old tabletop games and game books was one facet of making Elden Ring. I think more than anything, it's just my personal preference when it comes to RPGs and exploring those fantasy worlds, so you might see some of my personal idiosyncrasies come into play with Elden Ring there. I think that excitement, for me at least, comes from seeing that world map and piercing together that world map. So when we finally got to do that and start piecing that together when making Elden Ring, that was a really nice moment for me personally.</em></p>
<p><em>Back when doing interviews about Elden Ring, I think I mentioned that I'm still in the process of making my ideal fantasy RPG. And while Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close.</em></p>
<p><em>It's hard to say without giving spoilers for my next idea or our next games. But I think one thing that's not necessarily missing but makes it difficult to achieve my ideal is that when I play it, I know everything's going to happen. I already know everything that's going on. So, in terms of enjoying the game from a player's perspective, I'd love to not know that and for somebody else to make my ideal fantasy game, please, if possible. Then I can enjoy it just as a player.</em></p>
<p>Who knows if Miyazaki-san will ever get his wish? What we do know, however, is that the review embargo for Shadow of the Erdtree is up in just a few hours. Stay tuned on Wccftech to read what we thought of the first and last Elden Ring expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/magic-hazards-journey-bringing-a-story-driven-shooter-to-life-with-xsolla-accelerator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>With more games in the market than ever, it’s important to bring new ideas to stand out. That’s something Magic Hazard has at its core for its debut game Memory Lost.</p>
<p>Set in the dystopian cyberpunk-inspired metropolis of Detraxis, it’s a top-down action shooter where you play as an AI, the Neural Network, implanted into the body of an assassin robot who’s fighting for their freedom and destiny. What makes it unique from other games in the genre is that you can change how you play by capturing the memories of your enemies and gaining their abilities. This results in diverse and adaptable gameplay where over time players can master a wide range of mechanics without the need to create and level up a new character repeatedly.</p>
<p>Speaking to studio founder and CEO Sergei Kuznetsov, the idea came one cold February morning as he and a few friends sat around a kitchen table talking about the types of games they enjoyed playing from their childhood, and what they felt was missing.</p>
<p>“After five hours of discussions, we all agreed: since childhood, we've wanted to play as the enemies we fight against. Not just outwardly, but inwardly as well - using their weapons and abilities,” says Kuznetsov.</p>
<p>While some games like Halo allow players to acquire enemy weapons, these inexperienced but passionate young developers wanted to take the idea further by actually shifting and taking over a defeated enemy’s body, claiming their abilities for yourself.</p>

 </a>

<p>“You can find different types of enemies, providing new possibilities to control them,” he explains. That’s not just limited to weapon types but also different playstyles. “You can decide to capture someone who's got a melee ability, and you can upgrade your skill to improve your melee.”</p>
<p>But Kuznetsov was also interested in not just the mechanical possibilities but what this meant narratively. “If you inhabit an enemy's body, you copy his life. You travel in his skin, encounter his environment, and see significant memories,” he explains. “Will this make you view the enemy differently? Possibly. Maybe not sympathize, but at least understand the motivation.”</p>
<p>Of course, the game has also been balanced to ensure players are always adapting. “Our game designer did a lot of work to balance everything,” Kuznetsov explains. “So if you use up all your ammo and can't use your gun, you will need to find a new enemy to mind-capture.” You can even shift to a larger enemy who has more maximum health with strong melee, though they’re also slower moving, and as they’re a rarer enemy type it’s not easy to capture another replacement if you decide to shift to another body.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We spent around two years only developing four hours of gameplay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To avoid combat from becoming stale and monotonous, players are also constantly supplied with new variables, from new environmental hazards to avoid or use against the enemy, to new enemy types, which of course the transference mechanic also allows for new playstyles.</p>
<p>Development of Memory Lost began in 2020, starting with just five people - a programmer, a game designer, two novice 3D artists, and a novice 2D artist. “For the first five months, we brainstormed ideas, created a general concept, and studied the new field for ourselves,” says Kuznetsov.</p>
<p>More members gradually joined the project after that, including a few members from another studio whose prototype had fallen apart, eventually reaching 19 people. But while Magic Hazard was fueled by the passion for the concept, this was still a young and inexperienced team trying to figure out how to take Memory Lost to the next level, while Kuznetsov took on another job and other weekend side gigs to fund the team.</p>
<p>After a year of work, they presented the prototype to a panel of experts at DevGamm, consisting of representatives from publishers and marketing. Kuznetsov recalls it had been a brutal baptism of fire in terms of criticism but that when he followed up with emails he also received generous and detailed constructive feedback. Just some of the points raised included the lack of clarity when using the transference mechanics, a lack of variety in enemies and skills, flat level design, as well as a need to improve animation and visual impact.</p>
<p>“We went point by point to improve the game, reworking from scratch for half a year, and then presented it to them again,” he says. Comparing the initial build to how it is now, there’s also a clearer structure in how the combat and challenge evolves as players progress. For instance, Kuznetsov describes the initial chapters as having the following combat cycle:</p>
<p>1. Training - one enemy spawns at a time, a warm-up for introducing you to the flow.</p>
<p>2. Omnipotence - increasing enemy count, but which you’ll also have the necessary variety of firearms and mechanical mastery to handle, as players have a feeling of superiority and full control.</p>
<p>3. Challenge - quicker and larger enemy spawns with mixed weaponry, which pushes the player to master the mechanics in order to progress.</p>
<p>All that concludes with spaces afterward for players to take a break and explore the environments, giving them the time to resupply themselves but also discover bits of narrative in the world.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The team has improved the game following feedback from DevGamm and Xsolla Accelerator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As development continued, it was also becoming clear that Magic Hazard would need more assistance to get Memory Lost to the shape it needed to become competitive. “With no experience, you try to do something good but don't understand the amount of resources you need to do it,” Kuznetsov says, citing that deciding to make a narrative-driven game with entirely hand-crafted levels and an aim of providing six hours of gameplay added to the difficulty of development.</p>
<p>“A lot of games like roguelikes, you can create half an hour or an hour of gameplay, focusing on smaller pieces of assets but provide infinite ways to play,” he explains. “But if you choose storytelling, the things that you have to do are a lot more. We spent around two years only developing four hours of gameplay.”</p>
<p>But inspired by campaign-led games from the 1990s and early 2000s, this was something the team wanted to concentrate on, with more than 90,000 words of text capturing the team’s love of dark humour. That narrative isn’t just delivered from lore drops in the environment but also through dialogue, as your heroine, the Neural Network, is accompanied by two observers, MARK (Mobile Assistant of the Corporation Worker), a kind of mentor and colleague coexisting inside the same body, and the Liaison, a representative from the corporation Redsky who also created you. How you engage with NPCs, such as killing, sparing or ignoring them, can also affect the narrative, with multiple endings to unlock, making Memory Lost not just a one-and-done experience.</p>
<p>The external lifeline Magic Hazard needed came from Xsolla, which Kuznetsov had already been acquainted with after a meeting in late 2021. Fortunately, the company announced plans to launch Accelerator the following year and was looking for developers with interesting game ideas. After submitting its latest demo build, the studio successfully joined the programme.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Now I understand how to prepare beautiful presentations with gifs or videos that help people looking at your pitch"</p></blockquote>
<p>A major incentive for Kuznetsov was that Accelerator provided financial aid. While the team had been scraping by funding themselves for two years, the additional funding would be able make the overall package more appealing, such as more animated cutscenes and voice acting, which are important elements for an immersive story-driven game.</p>
<p>Being on the year-long programme also provided the team with lectures and mentorship, which really helped in all facets of improving Magic Hazard as a game business. “You have consultation hours where you can ask help from specialists in any area, from game design, to marketing, to publishing, and they’ll try to find a specialist to provide services to you,” says Kuznetsov.</p>
<p>One of the most important things he learned might also be typical for inexperienced game developers. You may have a good idea but you need to know how to sell it to your audience. In the very first instance, this meant how to effectively pitch the game to investors and publishers. “My pitches before were basically Google Docs,” he laughs. “Now I understand how to prepare beautiful presentations with gifs or videos that help people looking at your pitch understand the possibilities and features of our game.”</p>
<p>While the extra guidance and resources led to new features could also be implemented in the game, it also meant improving the beginning in terms of onboarding and teaching players the mechanics. An even better way to introduce Memory Lost was the decision to release a free Steam demo, subtitled Chapter One and including the first two levels, which received more than 90% positive feedback. “It’s actually less than 200 reviews,” Kuznetsov admits. “But after feedback from Accelerator and other experts helped us to improve the game, we’re really happy to receive that feedback.”</p>
<p>Magic Hazard is now collaborating with ESDigital who will be publishing Memory Lost later in 2024. “Of course, you just click a button and you can publish on Steam, but without a publisher, it's easy to release a game and no one will know about it. So I really hope the publisher will help us deliver information about our game to a lot of players around the world.” The publisher is also helping port the game to multiple platforms as well as with localisation and QA to ensure Memory Lost is in the best shape to reach as many players as possible.</p>
<p>There were still many other great ideas from Accelerator that Kuznetsov says the team wasn’t able to implement due to time, though he’s hopeful they will be considered in Magic Hazard’s future games. That’s a promising sign for a studio’s future prospects, which is apt as Accelerator isn’t just there to help a studio with one game but to ensure they can thrive as a business.</p>

        <p>Initially announced last March, early access release of the life sim had been delayed three times</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Paradox Interactive has cancelled its upcoming life sim Life By You.</p>
<p>The publisher's deputy CEO Mattias Lilja shared the news on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">Paradox Forum</a>, citing that the game didn't meet its or the community's expectations.</p>
<p>"Life By You has been in the works for a long time and we've been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game," Lilja wrote. "We opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realising the potential we saw.</p>
<p>"For each delay we made, we've seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture."</p>
<p>Lilja went on to explain why its latest early access release, set for June 4, and said that the studio felt the game was "lacking in some key areas."</p>
<p>"Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain."</p>
<p>Life By You was to be the debut title for Paradox Tectonic, an internal studio formed in 2019 and led by former Electronic Arts executive vice president Rod Humble.</p>
<p>The game was announced in March 2023, with an initial early access release date slated for later that year. This was delayed three times.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/oneodio-monitor-80-professional-headphones-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s a steady push for listeners to experience music, movies and games exactly how the creators intended, and if you’re serious about it you’ll want a pair of monitor headphones. By their nature, these are tuned to have as close to a flat EQ as possible, replicating the original audio without embellishing the bass or other elements. Many monitor headphones are premium, expensive options, but OneOdio are continuing their drive for top-class audio in a budget package. Priced at £99.99, the Monitor 80 come close to achieving that aim, but there are some caveats to be found thanks to its pricing.</p>
<p>The OneOdio Monitor immediately stand out thanks to their huge, egg-shaped hard case. It’s encased in faux-leather, boasts a chunky zipper, and proudly sports the OneOdio logo printed on top. It makes a good impression, even if it is outsized.</p>



<p>Nestling inside, you’ll find the Monitor 80 and two cables, one coiled and one straight, both with 3.5mm cable tips to plug into at the headphones end. They connect to different sockets though, with one boasting an old-school ¼ inch head, and the other 3.5mm. The headphones boast a 250-ohm impedance and an open-back design, meaning that you’ll need a decent amp to get the most out of them, and that everyone around you will hear what you’re listening to.</p>
<p>The headband boasts a plush leatherette covering and is embossed with the OneOdio logo, setting a great first impression, but after that the first true signs of the lower pricepoint begin to show, with the connective arms and central joints being fashioned out of cheap-feeling black plastic. The plastic offers the advantage of a lighter headset, but it doesn’t feel at all premium. The sizing adjusters are at least metal, and click reassuringly into place, and stay in the same position even after repeated uses.</p>

<p>The velvet ear cushions are pleasingly soft, and feel comfortable against your skin for extended periods of time, but the headband turns out to be a little too hard once it’s on your head. It could have done with an extra few millimetres of padding to help keep things comfy, and you’ll definitely start to feel it the longer that you wear them. It’s a real shame, especially when the low weight and soft earpads lull you into thinking they’re going to be a gentle fit.</p>

<p>The Monitor 80 are Hi-Res certified, meaning that they’re capable of reproducing higher-resolution music if you’ve got a suitable provider, such as Tidal or Apple Music, and an output device that can produce Hi-Res audio. Fortunately, I was able to test the Monitor 80 with my MacBook Pro, and a series of Hi-Res music files, before also trying it with an external DAC.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, there’s little of their own colour to the Monitor 80, and if you’re listening with a flat EQ on the source device, you’re getting a pretty close approximation of the creator’s true vision. That said, the 40mm drivers pick out the top-end details with such clarity that they can be a little harsh unless you temper it in some way. As a work tool, for both music or audio production, they’re absolutely going to help you dig into every note and tone, but as a regular listening tool they might be too much for some.</p>
<p>That said, with some tuning I found a lot to like with the Monitor 80’s audio output, and Hi-Res music sang through. The new Nerv single sounded suitably epic, with its chugging guitars retaining a vicious edge that matched well to Dillon Jones’s powerful vocals. Meanwhile, ‘Apocalypse’ by Bridges Ablaze boasted plenty of percussive punch to its math-metal, with each kick drum beat feeling fully formed and well-rounded, without any hint of distortion or bloat.</p>

<p>The only true downside to using the Monitor 80 for an extended period became the headband. I found it really started to weigh on me, and while I admittedly have little in the way of natural padding thanks to shaving my head, it’s not something that’s a problem with the best headphones. The Monitor 80’s laser-focus on audio reproduction also means that there’s no microphone, something which headphones will often feature as a small unit on one of the cables.</p>
<p>In terms of competitors, the Monitor 80 isn’t a traditional pair of headphones, so you have to consider them against similarly focused sets. I own a wonderful pair of Philips Fidelio X2HRs that OneOdio have certainly cribbed from along the way, and are, surprisingly found at more or less the same price of £110. They’re similarly Hi-Res certified, have a more comfortable floating headband, are more premium-feeling and only really miss out by not coming with a case. Still, if I had to choose between the two, the Philips set would win every time.</p>

<p>In 2022, the first Uncharted movie debuted worldwide, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake. It was a commercial success, bringing in almost half a billion dollars at the box office and setting up a surefire series of movies to follow – if the closing scenes of the first movie were anything to go by, at least.</p>



<p>Recently, Sony confirmed that a second movie is in the works, once again starring Holland as Nathan Drake (which is pretty obvious) and Mark Wahlberg as Sully (again, fairly obvious). When the first movie dropped, it was referenced that plans existed to turn it into a series – and that’s exactly what’s happening.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-drake">Return of the Drake</h2>



<p>During a recent appearance at the CineEurope trade show, Sony Pictures took to the stage to talk about everything that’s in the works, from 28 Years Later to the biopics based on The Beatles. Sony’s representatives also addressed the ‘Uncharted sequel’, which is set to be a direct follow-on from the 2022 movie – but the full title is yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>That wasn’t the only live-action adaptation touched upon at the presentation, as Sony also spoke about the Legend of Zelda flick that’s in production (<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/sony-cineeurope-the-beatles-zelda-quentin-tarantino-1236039944/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to Variety</a> for the tip).</p>



<p>In the last two or three years, live-action adaptations of video game franchises have exploded in popularity, with many series emerging to an overwhelmingly popular reception. Most recently, we saw The Last of Us and Fallout appear on streaming platforms worldwide, stunning audiences and even scooping awards as a result of their stunning levels of cinematography.</p>

        <p>Stockholders also invited to approve equity incentive plan to better retain talent</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson's compensation increased 22% year-on-year to over $25.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>This included his base salary of $1.3 million, stock awards representing over $20 million, non-equity incentive plan compensation of $3.4 million, and other compensation for more than $500,000, as per EA's annual meeting report and proxy statement for FY24.</p>
<p>This compared to a $20.6 million compensation in 2023.</p>
<p>Wilson is EA's executive with the highest compensation, followed by president of EA entertainment, technology and central development Laura Miele, at $12 million for FY24.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">Game Developer</a>, EA execs collectively earned over $60 million in 2024.</p>
<p>"Our board of directors, compensation committee and EA management are committed to maintaining pay-for-performance alignment in our executive compensation program," the document read.</p>
<p>"Our pay-for-performance approach is designed to reward the achievement of company-wide financial and business objectives, individual performance, and the creation of long-term value for stockholders, while also recognising the dynamic and highly competitive nature of our business and the market for top executive talent."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the document, stockholders were invited to approve the reinstatement of EA's 2019 equity incentive plan, which would see the number of shares of common stock increase by 2.1 million.</p>
<p>The move is "critical to attract and retain talent," EA said, noting that "the digital interactive entertainment industry continues to undergo dynamic change and transformation, creating an intensely competitive market for workers from an active and mobile talent pool."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-cutting-5-of-workforce">EA cut 5% of its workforce in February</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shut down Ridgeline Games</a>. In 2023, it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-restructuring-laying-off-6-of-workforce">already laid off 6% of its staff</a>, representing around 775 people at the time.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-changes-executive-compensation-scheme-cuts-execs-2021-pay">EA overhauled its exec compensation processes</a>, capping executive bonuses among others. That year, Wilson's compensation had reached $39.2 million, an 83% surge over FY2020. In 2022, that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-ceos-salary-drop-to-usd19-9-million">dropped to $19.9 million</a> and has been slowly going back up since.</p>
<p>For FY2024, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-madden-have-ea-posting-full-year-growth-despite-sleepy-q4">EA's revenue reached $7.56 billion</a>, a 2% increase over 2023.</p>

			<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-a-new-beginning-sales-were-underwhelming-says-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> from the Embracer Group's latest financial report that the Alone in the Dark reboot and the new Outcast game didn't do very well commercially.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Alone in the Dark developer Pieces Interactive has now been shut down by Embracer. The news came directly from the Swedish studio, which <a href="https://x.com/PiecesInt/status/1802612988286804218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> just a farewell image on Twitter/X. No other communication is currently available from either the developer or publisher.</p>
<p>Pieces Interactive was founded in 2007. The studio previously helped Arrowhead Game Studios with Magicka 2 and its DLCs. In 2017, they were acquired by Embracer. Their first projects under the umbrella were two Titan Quest expansions: <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/titan-quest-ragnarok-odin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnarök</a> and Atlantis.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Alone in the Dark reboot was supposed to be their big break, but despite high-profile actors like David Harbour and Jodie Comer, it didn't work out. That doesn't mean you should avoid playing the horror game if you've been on the fence; Nathan Birch quite enjoyed it, rating the game 7 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alone-in-the-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Despite my complaints, I have to admit, I still enjoyed this new Alone in the Dark overall. Maybe I’m just a sucker for that old-school survival horror feel, or maybe Alone in the Dark’s faults just didn’t sink in too deeply as no one section of the game sticks around all that long. Your first time through the game will take around 7 or 8 hours, although multiple playthroughs are encouraged in a number of ways. As mentioned, Edward and Emily’s stories aren’t that different, but a variety of collectibles, secrets, and unlockable endings will keep some happily in the dark for a while, although others may feel the urge to flick on the light switch before they collect everything.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is just the latest of several closures at Embracer, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volition</a>, Campfire Cabal, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/timesplitters-fans-have-their-hopes-crushed-once-again-by-new-closure-of-developer-free-radical-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Radical Design</a>, as well as many other layoffs that were part of the group's restructuring plan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-starfield-paid-mods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/todd-howard-said-bethesda-%E2%80%98hears-the-feedback%E2%80%99-about-paid-for-starfield-mods.904068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-starfield-paid-mods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Bethesda Game Studios recently found itself in hot water again concerning Starfield. With the recent launch of the ‘Creations’ platform on Starfield came a slew of paid-for mods, with BSG stuffing some content behind paywalls locked down tight with ‘Starfield Creation Credits’ requirements blocking the way forward. </p>



<p>One particularly troublesome mod was the Trackers Alliance mission called ‘The Vulture’, which was put behind a paywall costing 700 Creation Credits (around $7). It’s the second part of a line of missions, and the biggest concern here is that the first part was free to consume. However, in a recent interview, Bethesda’s Todd Howard revealed that the firm is aware of the feedback and is preparing to adjust how they deliver similar content in future.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-better">Do Better</h2>



<p>Almost ten years ago, Bethesda Game Studios tried locking some Skyrim mods behind a paywall – and that went down like a cup of cold sick. It seems that history has been doomed to repeat itself because, unlike Tony Stark, Bethesda doesn’t learn from its mistakes. In a recent interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard confirmed that BSG ‘hears that feedback’ and is going to ‘take a look at that and how we deliver content like that’ further down the line.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Matty Interviews Todd Howard: Future Of Fallout, Starfield Year 2, Elder Scrolls VI Info, &amp; MORE!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The addition of these paid mods caused hundreds of users to pour onto <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-review-bombed-bethesda/">Steam to review-bomb Starfield</a>, which took a nosedive in ratings as the controversy unfolded. Despite Howard appearing in the interview to defend the price point and stressing that there’s a substantial amount of content wrapped up in it, users were still (understandably) vexed by the decision.</p>



<p>Howard said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We need to evaluate both pricing, what we put out for free, how we communicate what’s in something, and really hear from the community there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other news, Starfield fans were left disappointed following the recent Xbox Games Showcase when Shattered Space received a new trailer but <strong>still </strong>didn’t get a release date. This is the highly anticipated first major expansion for Starfield, but despite being revealed long before the game was released in September 2023, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shattered-space-release-date-coming/">still doesn’t have a launch date</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-cancelled-by-paradox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last month, Paradox Interactive announced that it was going to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-delayed-indefinitely/">indefinitely delay its Sims competitor Life By You,</a> and now the publisher has gone a step further by cancelling the project outright. Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive, released a statement as to why Life By You has been cancelled, with the key points being an uncertain development timeframe, a failure to meet expectations, and the game not delivering in important areas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life by You | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9c3WEYTJIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the statement, Mattias Lilja said, <em>“Sadly, we’ve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim Life by You. This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community’s expectations. We realize this raises some large questions; here we hope to shed at least some light on why we opted to cancel, rather than delay as we communicated earlier.</em></p>
<p><em>Life by You has been in the works for a long time and we’ve been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game. Our hope was always that it would be able to leave a mark in this exciting and new genre for us. That’s why we’ve opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realizing the potential we saw. For each delay we made, we’ve seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture.</em></p>
<p><em>A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate Life by You, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.</em></p>

<p><em>At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we don’t find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/20/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-heads-to-early-access-in-september/">Life By You was revealed in March 2023,&nbsp;</a>with Paradox aiming for a September 2023 early access release at the time. As that date neared, Paradox pushed the early access release to March 2024, before delaying the game indefinitely, and then making the decision to cancel it outright.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/todays-nintendo-direct-will-be-light-on-first-party-games-leaker-says-says-fans-should-manage-expectations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's Nintendo Direct will be "light" on first-party titles, but it might very well contain some surprise announcements.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-back-half-2024-announced-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo announced a new Direct</a> episode for later today, and fans have been speculating about the broadcast's contents. Will we finally see more from <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-reveal-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>, and what about the long-rumored<a href="https://wccftech.com/life-by-you-canceled-paradox-struggles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess Switch ports</a>? Well, according to reputable Nintendo leaker 'Pyoro', fans might do well to manage their expectations. In addition, the leaker said that, while he does expect some surprises, Nintendo won't be showing a lot of first-party games. "It will be light on 1st party stuff but I expect some surprises", the leaker <a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802900013112336868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X when asked about Nintendo's own titles.</p>
<p>In a more recent post on X, 'Pyoro'<a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802936397038531046" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted a rather cryptic set of emoticons</a> before <a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802938088416805076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> "Summer is here". Following these posts, plenty of fans seem to believe that Nintendo will be announcing either a new Mario &amp; Sonic title during the show or possibly a new Tomodachi Life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no further details were shared by the leaker, and we'll just have to wait until later today to learn what Nintendo has up its sleeve for the back half of this year. As again pointed out by Nintendo, the broadcast won't touch on the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor.</p>
<p>What are your expectations from today's Direct episode? Will we finally be seeing more from the new Metroid? Possibly the new rumored 2D Zelda entry? And what about the rumors about a new Star Fox?&nbsp; Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Today's Nintendo Direct will air at 10 am ET. We'll update you as soon as more information about the Direct comes in. Of course, we'll be covering the broadcast once it airs.</p>

<p id="7e50o5">Roggenrola’s shiny debuted during its very own <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2022/9/18/23356686/roggenrola-community-day-shiny-boldore-gigalith-special-move-meteor-beam">Roggenrola Community Day</a> in September 2022. Gigalith is a pretty decent rock-type attacker, but it has become massively outclassed since its Community Day. You’re better off with Rhyperior, Rampardos, Tyrantrum, or Terrakion (if you have them).</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Roggenrola in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Roggenrola is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

The full statement is as follows:</p><blockquote>Paradox Interactive (Paradox) has today decided to cancel the release of the game Life by You. This means that the second quarter of 2024 will be impacted negatively by MSEK 208 from the write-down of the game’s total capitalized development costs.</blockquote><blockquote><em>For a long time, we’ve held hopes for Life by You and the potential we saw in it, but it is now clear that the game will not be able to meet our expectations. A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release. Moving forward, we should perform at a much higher level, and it’s obvious that we have work ahead of us,</em> said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.</blockquote><blockquote><em>We’ve performed poorly in recent releases,</em> continued Wester. <em>Even though we now start new projects in a different manner, it is clear that we must make further changes so that quality is more consistent and the promises we make to our players are met.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-sims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sims</a> has been a massive cash cow for EA, so it wasn’t super surprising when Paradox Interactive announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/life-by-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life by You</a>, their take on The Sims formula developed by a new team led by former Sims boss Rod Humble. Unfortunately, Life by You didn’t end up being the easy layup it seemed like it should be, as the game’s early access launch was delayed multiple times, and now Paradox has announced they’re outright canceling the game.</p>
<p>Here’s what Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to say about Life by You being canned</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Sadly, we’ve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim Life by You.

We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</em></p>
<p>Paradox Interactive has struggled in recent years, with the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cities-skylines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cities: Skylines 2</a> being beset with issues at launch, and games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/star-trek-infinite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Trek: Infinite</a> and the Civ-challenger <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/millenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millenia</a> flopping at launch. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> has also been through a protracted and messy development cycle, with the project’s success being far from secure. A successful life sim would have really added to Paradox’s portfolio, but instead Life by You joins the company’s string of recent failures.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the current state of Paradox? What can they do to turn it around?</p>

However, based on a forum post by Paradox’s deputy CEO Mattias Lilja, the game had some issues that may not have been easily fixable even with additional time for development.</p><p>“A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate <em>Life by You</em>, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas,” Lilja says. “Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain.”</p><p>Lilja says that the game “had a number of strengths,” but the company realized that “when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop.”</p><div><p>The game’s initial early access launch had been set for September 2023, but it was pushed to <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/life-by-you/blog/life-update-early-access-date-change">March 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/life-by-you/blog/life-update-Early-Access-Date-Change">then June</a>, and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">then delayed indefinitely in May</a> before being officially canceled.</p></div><p>The <em>Life by You</em> team hasn’t been the only one trying to make a new take on <em>The Sims</em>: former <em>XCOM</em> developers recently launched Midsummer Studios <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155843/midsummer-studios-next-gen-life-sim-the-sims">to develop a new life sim game</a> of their own.

<p data-characters="320" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To the despair of all who —like me— expended their Astrite reserves in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-yinlin-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yinlin </a>banner, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em> 1.1 is set to feature the playable debut of both Changli and Jinhsi. And while the Magistrate of Jinzhou has leaked, revealing her role as a Spectro main DPS, what will be the role of her counselor and mentor? </p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">To answer that and make the wait for her debut a little more manageable, here’s everything you need to know about Changli, including her role, release date, and a full breakdown of her set. </p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"> <li>Table of Contents: <ul> <li><a href="#h-is-changli-a-support-or-a-dps-in-wuthering-waves">Is Changli a support or a DPS?</a></li> <li><a href="#h-wuthering-waves-changli-resonance-skill-forte-circuit-and-inherent-skills-explained">Skill, Liberation, and passives explained</a></li> <li><a href="#h-all-changli-resonance-chain-nodes-and-their-effects">All Resonance Chain Nodes and their effects</a></li> <li><a href="#h-changli-release-date-and-banner">Release date and banner</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="h-is-changli-a-support-or-a-dps-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Is Changli a support or a DPS in Wuthering Waves?</h2> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">According to her leaked set currently available on Hakushi, Changli will be a sword wielder, and a Fusion on-field main DPS focused on dealing massive Resonance Skill DMG. While in the field, she will also be able to trigger a handful of damage-oriented buffs. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">If her kit is not changed, she will also be a great fit for double-Fusion DPS teams or those featuring Liberation sub-DPSs. The reason? Her ability to offer a 20% Fusion and 25% Resonance Liberation DMG buff through her Outro Skill.</p>
 <h2 id="h-wuthering-waves-changli-resonance-skill-forte-circuit-and-inherent-skills-explained" data-injectable="false">Wuthering Waves Changli: Resonance Skill, Forte Circuit, and Inherent Skills explained</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">According to her leaked set, Changli’s Resonance Skill (Tripartite Flames) allows her to perform a series of slashes and an enhanced plunging attack. After performing it, she will then enter her True Sight state. Tripartite Flames can be performed up to two times in sequence. </p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">Changli will also be able to enter True Sight after performing her basic attack 4 while both on the ground or airborne (yes, she can perform air combos). The state will last for 12 seconds and apply the following effects to her:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Performing any grounded basic attack will trigger True Sight: Conquest. The damage of the move is considered Resonance Skill DMG. After performing two Conquest moves, True Sight will end. </li> <li>Performing her basic attack while in the air will trigger True Sight: Charge. The move’s damage will be considered a Resonance Skill DMG and performing it will forcibly end True Sight. </li> </ul> <p data-characters="553" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Her Flaming Vow Forte Circuit, on the other hand, allows Changli to perform an enhanced version of her Heavy Attack —called Flaming Sacrifice— by performing it while carrying four stacks of Enflamement. The damage of the move will be considered Resonance Skill DMG. You will be able to get Enflamement stacks by performing True Sight: Conquest, True Sight: Charge, and her Resonance Liberation. All of her Inherent Skills also revolve around Enflamement. You can check out their descriptions below, based on the values currently featured in Hakushi:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center"><strong>Inherent Skill</strong>s</th><th>Effects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Secret Strategist</strong></td><td>The Fusion DMG of True Sight: Conquest and Charge will be increased by 5% for each Enflamement stack in your possession.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sweeping Force</strong></td><td>Changli will get a 20% Fusion DMG Bonus buff after performing both Flaming Sacrifice and her Resonance Liberation. Doing so will also allow her to ignore 15% of the defense of her targets. </td></tr></tbody></table></figure> <h3 id="h-what-about-her-resonance-liberation" data-injectable="false">What about her Resonance Liberation?</h3> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">As leaked on Hakushi, Changli’s Resonance Liberation (Radiance of Fealty), will allow her to perform a large Fusion AoE attack. The move will also grant her 4 stacks of Enflamement and allow her to enter her Fiery Feather state. Performing Flaming Sacrifice while in the state will grant her a 25% ATK boost. You can check out a showcase of Changli’s full moveset below, courtesy of Dimbreath.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-all-changli-resonance-chain-nodes-and-their-effects" data-injectable="false">All Changli Resonance Chain Nodes and their effects </h2> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">As you can expect from a DPS, all of Changli’s Resonance Nodes are focused on adding to her damage. You can check out an overview of all of them below, based on the values showcased at Hakushi:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Resonance Chain Nodes</th><th data-align="center">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>1.

Pursuit of Desires</strong></td><td data-align="center">Acquiring a stack of Enflamement will increase Changli’s Crit DMG by 30%. It’s unknown if the effect can stack or if it simply resets. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>3.

The effect will last for 30 seconds. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>5. Sacrificed Gains</strong></td><td data-align="center">Increases the multipliers of Flaming Vow by 50%. Performing the attack will also increase Changli’s ATK by 50%. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>6. Realized Plans</strong></td><td data-align="center">Tripartite Flames, Flaming Vow, and Radiance of Fealty will now ignore 40% of the defense of its targets. </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
  <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">According to a leak by Mero, which includes a look at its main screen, the Changli banner will be called Stellar Plumage and feature <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhi</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-taoqi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taoqi</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortefi</a> as its featured 4-star resonators.

Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.</p>

<p>The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from <em>Knight Rider</em>, <em>Jurassic Park</em>'s 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future</em>&nbsp;film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of cozy life simulators got some sad news today. Paradox Interactive has announced Life By You, their highly anticipated life simulator, has been shelved. This is disappointing for fans of the project since it was seen as competition for EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Sims</em></a> series.</p>
<h2>The <em>Life By You</em> Cancellation</h2>
<p>The cancellation of <em>Life By You</em> was announced in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">Paradox forum post</a> by Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja. Lilja mentions that the decision was difficult and a failure on Paradox's part to meet expectations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/life-by-you-conversation-system-screenshot.jpg?itok=yblRMSCR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/life-by-you-conversation-system-screenshot.jpg?itok=XvgszgKL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess we won't see this get any more polish.</figcaption></figure><p>Lilja continues stating the developers were given a fair shot to realize the game's potential, citing two different delays as well as choosing to hold off on an Early Access release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate <em>Life by You</em>, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; <em>Life by You</em> had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Lilja's explanation of <em>Life By You's</em> cancellation is measured and principled; putting accountability on management. It puts into perspective the promises and ambition the game touted on its Steam storepage. It also sours our preview of the game, which held promise.</p>
<p>The cancellation of <em>Life By You</em> is a shame for fans of the recent trend of cozy games. Life simulators are built around pleasant suburban environments and a relaxed atmosphere. These have included high profile releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em></a>, and smaller indie titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cozy-grove" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cozy Grove</em></a>.</p>

<section><p>With Shadow of the Erdtree complete, Miyazaki reflects on the development of From Software's first open-world game.</p></section>
        
  
  

        
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                                        <p dir="ltr">The launch of Shadow of the Erdtree brings a new and exciting journey for From Software to its end. Elden Ring, released two years ago, was the studio's first venture into the open-world genre, a massive undertaking full of complex challenges even for studios that have a long history of making them, let alone one taking its first crack at it.</p><p dir="ltr">For From Software and game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, it was an opportunity to leverage years of experience making Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and other titles to give players a game that retains the sense of adventure and challenge the studio is known for, while also offering the freedom to explore a vast landscape full of possibilities. Shadow of the Erdtree, the first and only DLC of Elden Ring, is the completion of that vision.</p><p dir="ltr">With Shadow of the Erdtree on the cusp of release, GameSpot spoke to Miyazaki-san about this journey and the road to making Elden Ring happen, as well as what he learned from the experience, what he envisions his next projects being, and the future of From Software as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: How does this moment feel, given that it's essentially the end of a big journey for Elden Ring? What does it feel like for you and the team; what's your state of mind?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki: </strong>A few things. First, Elden Ring, for us, we've never made a game of this caliber and scope before, so it's an experience that I think myself and the entire team has not experienced both in terms of volume as well as the success itself. Elden Ring is, in terms of scope, just so much bigger than anything we've worked on in the past. I think it really helped grow and nurture a lot of our in-house talent as From Software. So the timing was right and we knew we wanted to take on a new challenge. Through developing Elden Ring, I think a lot of our talent, including directors who are not me or game designers, game planners who are not the core team that usually designs games within From Software [benefitted], it really served as a kind of foundation for us to build upon and grow into the next stage as a company.</p><p dir="ltr">I believe that will translate into being able to show the world the so-called new From Software, as well as the types of games that we will be developing in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">To add to that, I think developing this game was genuinely just fun for me and the whole team. Being able to build out a world and game of this scope, as well as collaborating with George R.R. Martin, I think is just one of those experiences you don't get to have every day. So in terms of the unique joy in myself and the staff, I think that really helped us grow and hopefully someday we can apply all of these learnings and experiences to what we develop next, whatever that new challenge ends up becoming for the company.</p><p dir="ltr">And again, the enormous success that Elden Ring experienced, of course we're very, very thankful to the fans who have supported the game. I think that it is that support that will enable us to take on whatever next challenge it is we want to as a company. So I want to give out a heartfelt thanks to everyone who's supported the franchise so far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320519-7526721181-ss_7b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320519-7526721181-ss_7b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320519"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320519-7526721181-ss_7b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Open-world games are a big challenge to make and it takes a lot out of a studio to do them. Do you now see this is the baseline for future games and open worlds being the kind of core of [From Software's] games going forward? Or do you hope to return to something a little more linear and focused in the way that games are made?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I wouldn't necessarily say that open world is going to become the new base or foundation or standard of the company. As I kind of hinted in earlier responses, we have a lot of game directors and designers who are growing, so we'd love to keep an open mind in terms of the types of games that we develop. So, of course, I can't really say anything at this exact moment, but perhaps when you see future announcements from From Software you'll look back at this point and think, "Ah, that's what he meant."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you remember how it was to make the decision to go open-world? Having made multiple Dark Souls games, Bloodborne, and Sekiro did you feel confident and capable or was there still a sense of nervousness about pulling it off?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, there were a couple of things that we had going for us. As you mentioned, having built up our experience and team with Dark Souls, I think that foundation gave us a certain amount of confidence. Likewise, seeing the team grow also gave us a different type of confidence that it was achievable. If you asked me if we were 100% sure we could pull it off, the answer would not have been yes at the time, but it did feel like there was a path to achieving what we set out to do. And of course, once we were on that journey, we realized how naive we were.</p><p dir="ltr">But of course everything leading up to Elden Ring has been built within the company brick-by-brick, if you will. And what we were setting out to achieve with Elden Ring we knew was an extension of what we've built up. So instead of just doing what we already know, we've always wanted to push the status quo and kind of extend ourselves a little bit, which was what helped create Elden Ring.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you remember what the mission statement or the objective was for this game? What is it that you wanted to have achieved and do you think that you have done so?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think in the very, very early stages of Elden Ring's proposal, a lot of the core concepts came down to giving players this adventurous feel, this very open-world freedom, if you will, and adjusting the difficulty to match that freedom that we're giving players. That was a huge mission statement or thematic element we wanted to achieve with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">I think to a degree we have achieved that. But like all the games that we release at From Software, nothing is ever perfect. So there were certainly learnings from this experience. There were certainly some failures and shortcomings. But if I had the chance to redo this, I think I might do something differently but I would like the chance to revisit a lot of the themes that we set out to achieve.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You make these worlds that are vicious to you to begin with; they make you feel like you don't belong there, and by the end of it you have conquered it. But for certain people that keep coming back it starts feeling like home--counter to the design intent. How does it make you feel knowing that there are people out there who come to this world that you designed to push them away because it makes them feel good? I often return to the games and I'm in these worlds because they make me feel capable and happy.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think that some of that was part of the design, it was designed as intended. And I think what you're referring to is the sort of severity of the world and how brutal it can be, which oftentimes translates to the difficulty and learning curve. But by conquering a lot of those challenges, players will be able to call that place, that world, their home like, "I've conquered it." And I think there is certainly a sense of enjoyment that people can feel from it. One of the core themes of Elden Ring is this sense of achievement and perhaps what you just described is a small part of that sense of achievement, when these worlds start to feel like your home. The fact that you brought that up of course makes me really, really happy because it was working as intended.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I like to go back and fight Malenia when I need a little confidence boost, and it was the same way with Sekiro and Genichiro.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When you're having challenges in your life or need a confidence boost, the fact that you turn to Sekiro and Elden Ring I think shows a lot of courage [laughs]. I don't know if I would say a lot of that was an intended core part of the game design itself, but whether it's Elden Ring, Sekiro, Dark Souls, there is certainly that sense of achievement that I mentioned earlier of overcoming a challenge, and it makes sense how that would translate to a boost in confidence.</p><p dir="ltr">Our world, the real world, has a lot of challenges and there are a lot of obstacles that we face every day, and some of these obstacles are not always achievable or conquerable. However, I think there is something innately comforting in knowing that within this realm of video games, it is conquerable and achievable. So if you face it head-on and interpret what's happening on the screen and the inputs, you can again feel that sense of achievement. So I do think about that sometimes, how through this interactive medium of video games we can have that communication.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Each new release from the studio is a chance for it to evolve but usually what we hear is, "From Software is the team that makes hard games." What is your interpretation of your identity now and how do you see From Software?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It would be hard to describe the next chapter of From Software in one word but if I had to, I think it would come down to value and how we create this value. The words that you use to describe it, fantasy, world setting, difficulty, sense of achievement, that perhaps I think is more closely tied to my own set of values than the company itself. These new directors and game designers that are up-and-coming, our in-house talent, may not share those exact same values. I don't want to say something right now and commit to the future direction of From Software and bind what they're able to do.</p><p dir="ltr">But if you look at it more broadly, I think it all comes down to creating and providing that value to gamers and being able to do that at 100%. So, making sure the environment is conducive to that type of thinking, and [creating] a path to be able to achieve that is to me what I think as the president and how I feel about the future of the company. So in reality it's a very simple company, I would say.</p><p dir="ltr">For the immediate future, I think how fans have responded to our games, and I daresay the amount of trust they've placed in us as a brand, has provided us with this opportunity to be able to show different types of value that we can add. So I think our job at this point is to not betray that trust and expectation.</p><p dir="ltr">On an individual level, however, the sense of overcoming challenges, and the dark fantasy world setting is something I will always have, but I don't necessarily think that will always be the direction of the company because others might feel differently.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It feels that diversity of games is starting to come out. I've never seen as many people excited about Armored Core and it's obviously because of that trust. That must make you feel very confident in where you're going and the team.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That there are so many Armored Core players tells me that perhaps our direction or our process wasn't necessarily wrong, and we're on the right track. So it's certainly a confidence boost. But more so than that, I am very thankful for the fans who have responded and embraced that trust that we've built together. So I understand Armored Core was never a huge franchise adopted by many players, but seeing the current state of the franchise I think makes us know that we're on the right path. And I think the same can be said for me as well as the company as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Last time we spoke you had moved to a leadership position and one of the things that you talked about was helping to serve that function but also staying in the thick of creating games. Having now created the biggest game you've made, how is that balance going? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">With respect to the balance between being the president versus being a game director, I would say that hasn't changed from our last conversation. And if I had to give it a ratio of president to game director, I would say it would be about one to nine in terms of ratio. So that hasn't changed. What makes that possible, I would say, is on the more management or the president side of the business I have a really good team who's able to support it.</p><p dir="ltr">And what it comes down to is me in a leadership position on the executive side, I want to focus on the things that only I am able to do, and I think that's what I should be doing. And what that comes down to is keeping the vision for the company as well as passing judgment on if any one goal is being achieved and how we set those metrics. So the vision is setting the goal where the company should point where we should steer the ship and the judgment part is determining what's needed, including the talent, the resources we're deploying, how we evaluate and interpret talent and these resources, and how they're being applied to our goal. To me, that's something only I can do and the biggest contribution I can provide in the leadership role. The rest of the management really comes down to having such a great team.</p><p dir="ltr">What's enabling us to do that is, I think going back to the previous response, the simplicity of how From Software is set up and how From Software paints its vision. We're going to make good games and keep that entire mechanism and machine sustainable so we can continue to make good games. It's that simplicity of directing everything towards value that allows me to spend, one part, doing president and, nine parts, being a game director. So if that balance and that overall vision start to point in a different direction, perhaps I'm not best suited for that role anymore.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Going from memory here, but I believe this is the longest period you have had between releasing a core game and then a DLC. What was it like spending this much time on a DLC and what challenges did you find that were new compared to your previous games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You are correct in that this is the longest period between a base game and its DLC, however, that was not the intent per se and more of a byproduct as we embarked on this journey of developing it. If you ask why, it simply comes down to the sheer volume of content that is in the DLC, which doesn't compare with others, but of course it translates into more time and more resources being applied to it. And if you ask why Elden Ring's DLC has so much more volume, for me it comes down to the gameplay of Elden Ring and how the game itself is structured.</p><p dir="ltr">At its core, Elden Ring is about adventure, exploration of the unknown. and the sense of freedom that players get when playing Elden Ring. To make sure the DLC lives up to those core themes or core concepts, it necessitated creating a massive volume and the scale, so that we're not losing sight and the players aren't disappointed in those elements. So I think it was a necessity given the game design and gameplay of Elden Ring that the DLC took two years.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320523-0387401362-ss_cb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320523-0387401362-ss_cb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320523"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320523-0387401362-ss_cb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How difficult is it to stay the course in your ideas when in that period, you see the people who love these games, the fans talking so much about what the game is, what they hope the next part of it is going to be? Are you tempted to react?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I would say it's the hybrid, but first and foremost, as a foundation, there is the original vision of what we set out to achieve with this DLC. And there is a strong idea of the type of experience we want players to have. And that being said, with the base game out in the wild, there are a lot of comments and feedback that users have. We tap into that as more of a means to adjust the game or tweak the balance or brush up the experience. But I would say there is certainly a foundation of what we are trying to do before user reactions or comments come into play.</p><p dir="ltr">And that's something that is not just limited to this DLC. That same philosophy applies to everything that we do at From Software. There is always a vision or a concept of what we want to do and that comes from within the creators. We always have one eye on what the users and audiences are saying, so we can feed that back into the design or the experience and making sure we're not completely ignoring reactions. That's also combined with the experience the studio has built over the years as well, which is a very strong asset.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A big part of how people experience the game is how they interpret it, but for you, what was the theme you wanted to pursue in the DLC? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there are certainly themes that I have and themes that I hope audiences will experience. That can be said for Shadow of Erdtree as well as past games I've made, or even the base Elden Ring game. That being said, I don't think it would be fair for me to explain that to players or tell that to players. The video game is supposed to be experienced, and I think that personal experience and interpretation is what's most important. So whether it's before or after the game is accessible to wider audiences, myself coming in and saying, "Well, actually this was the theme" would really take away or distract from the experience and that interpretation each individual player has built around their own adventure. On a more personal level, I think me trying to take these ideas and themes that I have and put them into words and say them out loud is, on a very simple level, embarrassing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you construct a story by saying less and has it become easier over the years?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I don't know if I would necessarily say it's difficult to construct it in this way and perhaps this is, I don't know if it's myself or From Software as a brand, but by having these denser and lighter moments, we try to keep everything rather simple. In the case of Elden Ring, the so-called gaps that you mentioned come from the gameplay of us wanting to encourage people to explore and have their own adventure. And you yourself said, once you understand this and can feel this, you make the world your own in some way and it feels closer. Enabling players to feel that informed a lot of our storytelling style.</p><p dir="ltr">And this act of players trying to understand and trying to go deeper into this world is a huge, fun point, or value-add that Elden Ring provides. And it's also something that I myself really enjoy, this idea of understanding and unboxing this world is a very attractive way to immerse oneself. So perhaps it is unique compared to a lot of other more setting-heavy games, but I find that enjoyable so it translates into the games as well.</p><p><strong>Do you watch other people or the fans theorize or the videos they make or are you content with letting that happen outside of your vision?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I watch them. Of course, I can't watch all of them, but I do like to watch them and I actually enjoy that process. I think it's quite fun to see how people piece together their own theories or working theories based on a lot of fragmented information that the game provides. Some can be derived from hints in the game, others are completely theorized. But regardless, for me, I find it quite enjoyable to see the different interpretations that the fans and audiences have.</p><p dir="ltr">I think it's a very desirable mechanic and the game was designed that way for people to be able to fill in those gaps. So, regardless of whether they're correct or maybe not, it doesn't change the way I watch these videos. I like to see it on a very objective level and say, "Oh, that's an interesting way to piece together all these fragments." So that's how I interact with that type of user-generated content.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Taking that ethos and applying it to ending your DLC, how do you make it feel like a conclusion instead of an end to the world. Do you even want to leave it open to say, "We've got more to do in the future"?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Concerning Shadow of Erdtree, that's something where I very strongly wanted to make sure audiences feel Miquella's ending. And there of course might be room for interpretation in there, but the overall feel is a definitive closure to his arc. So if Shadow of Erdtree is Miquella's story, he has his conclusive endpoint.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things I really like is that your games always treat the player character as insignificant. You are a Tarnished and everyone's constantly telling you that you are worthless. Traditionally people want their characters to feel special, a chosen one, or a savior. Where does that come from? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">The game world is a quite severe and vicious place, including the very strong enemies. And I think that disdain that a lot of the game world and NPCs show towards the player is perhaps an extension of that harshness that you experience. And I think the same can be said about our own surroundings and world, where it's quite cold and harsh at times. That link between reality or that harshness drives us in our world to find the beauty within it. And perhaps I think that's the value that we provide and the value we experience at the core of this game. Whenever there's a game and from the onset everyone's like, "Oh my God, you're the hero. Thank you so much," to me it doesn't feel real.</p><p dir="ltr">So if you hear just that part, it might make me seem like a sick or crazy person. But I think that's where a lot of the reality comes from. Take love or any type of emotion that you may feel, if there's too much of it, I think it lowers its value. So it's that scarcity that I think really makes people feel and appreciate whatever it is they're experiencing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I love reading superhero comics like Superman and they are partly about how he's special and amazing and savior of the world. But these days I'm drawn more to the stories of struggle, much like your games are or manga like Berserk is, and I see that a lot with others too. Do you think it's a bit of a cultural shift that these darker stories are more in demand?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">To make sure there's no confusion, I want to be clear that, as a consumer, I love both. I love Superman and I love Berserk. I think they both have their own flavor and their own touch, but they're both super enjoyable. When I said reality feels harsh and the games I make are in a way a reflection of that, that's more me personally, how I have a worldview and how I translate that into the game design. The fact that happened to be a cultural match in terms of the times and the era that we live in, of course, there's a sense of relief and happiness there as well. But again, that's just how I create games. But as a consumer, I love all flavors.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Following on from that, how many of the games you make are a reflection of how you're feeling? It's a joke among fans that there must be something going on in there to be able to conjure the kind of imagery From Software does. Are you guys okay? Is everything alright over there?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">[Laughs] A lot of the creature and monster design comes from my direction, and looking only at myself I mean, I feel okay. I think I'm pretty healthy and I'm enjoying life. So all joking aside, yeah, I think that it kind of is what it is.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's good. We're just checking.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">[Laughs]</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the big parts of Elden Ring has been the collaboration with George R. R. Martin. How do you reflect on that experience now that the process has come to an end and is it something that you want to do again? I know a lot of people are talking about Brandon Sanderson as someone they'd love to see a collaboration with, and he's a fan of games.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">One of the huge value-adds of Elden Ring is, of course, George R. R. Martin's contribution in terms of the lore and the mythology, and it is one of the very unique points that other From Software games don't have. When the team was able to start unpacking his lore and his mythology, it turned into a huge stimulation for us, and it was something that on the development side, we don't get to experience that often. So there was a lot of fun in terms of the world-building and world-setting and trying to decipher and depict and then translate that to what players see on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">So if we have the chance to work with another major creator, I think we would definitely be open to exploring that because of how unique the experience was, both on the development side as well as what players experienced. And with regards to George R. R. Martin himself as a person, aside from the stimulation the team received from all of his amazing mythology and lore, George had a very good understanding of game design and video games in general. I think he has a certain respect for it as well, so that made the collaboration and the entire process very, very seamless and easy for us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320518-4646349053-ss_82.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320518" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320518-4646349053-ss_82.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320518"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4320518-4646349053-ss_82.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do other mediums interest you, especially for the games that you have made? There are no doubt plenty of opportunities to use the success of Elden Ring or Dark Souls to make a movie, a TV show, or something else outside of games. Do you foresee a future where you want to adapt things or try different mediums?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I don't know if I should say we or perhaps me in this instance, but I have no intention of saying, "Oh, there's never going to be a movie" or denying all possibilities of other adaptations. It's just how I think and how I best communicate with audiences is through the interactive medium. So that's where my focus has gone. And when I think about how I can best communicate, it is through that interactivity. There are many others who can make a much better linear format content than we can. For myself and From Software, I think the biggest value-add that we can provide is by making games. So again, not saying no to any possibilities, but perhaps there are others who are better suited to adapting Elden Ring and other From Software franchises into different medium formats.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You've been successful in realizing the sense of adventure and challenge that you wanted to achieve with Elden Ring. Do you think those two elements will continue to be the focus going forward or do you have new ideas or themes you want to tackle?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">On the one hand, I often direct multiple games or oversee multiple games at once, so that difficulty curve and sense of achievement are always going to be a core of my game direction and game design. But with another game, perhaps--and this is going to happen sometime in the future that I'll be able to talk about it in more detail--there might be different themes or core elements.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I guess another way to ask the question is, what excites you in games now and make you excited to play and create?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are many elements that excite me when it comes to both video games and tabletop board games, and I think that there are many joys to be extracted from that. But for me, personally, what brings the most excitement comes while I'm making a game. Whenever I have a good idea and I can create a hypothesis and then test that theory against, "Hey, is this fun? Is this a good idea or not?" Those moments to me bring the most excitement. So perhaps through my work, I am constantly chasing that feeling and that excitement as I'm making games.</p><p dir="ltr">One other thing that really excites me right now is watching my daughter grow. And this might be a very short-term thing, but it's fascinating and very interesting to see a small human being discover or see the world; see how a human is constructed or built in a way, how the personality is formed, how they start to identify and build their own identity. And this might just be being a father, but I think that there's certainly something there that excites me.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you think that the experience of doing that, watching your daughter grow will eventually make its way into the game? Do you think about how that more naive and idealistic perspective kids have could change how you see the world and thus the worlds you depict in games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I don't think about that too much and I am not against the idea of change. In a lot of ways, I think having a daughter can expand the possibilities, and that expansion is a necessary element of continuing to make great games--a stimulant of [creativity] if you will. And I don't mean to talk about my daughter as an object or anything, but in the process of making games, I think it is a necessary and important stimulant because it helps you see the world through a different lens in a lot of ways. And if that is causing worry for my fans or the gamers, I don't think there's much to worry about.</p><p dir="ltr">For me, it's again, finding and discovering that fleeting moment of beauty in a lot of these dark, cold, harsh, grotesque worlds that I think allows it to shine even more. That philosophy applies to how I design and direct video games. So if I find a newer, even higher or more stimulating beauty, that will just help make the worlds even darker, more grotesque, and harsher so that it can shine even brighter. In terms of a fantasy world, the brighter something shines, the darker the shadow it casts, right?</p>

<p data-characters="488" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The end of a decade-long saga is here, and to say Bungie was under pressure is a bit of an understatement. Following the <a href="https://progameguides.com/destiny/destiny-2-lightfall-review-the-light-has-abandoned-us/">poor reception of <em>Lightfall</em></a> and the <a href="https://progameguides.com/destiny/a-full-recap-of-the-bungie-layoff-situation-and-what-it-means-for-players/">disastrous week</a> in which roughly eight percent of staff was suddenly laid off in addition to the revelation leadership was actively hamstringing the looter shooter, the community’s morale was at an all-time low. The developer desperately needed a win. So, after a few weeks in, has <em>The Final Shape </em>righted the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> ship?</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Launch Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true"><em><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong></em> <strong>(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2336880/Destiny_2_The_Final_Shape/">PC</a> [Reviewed], PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)<br>Developer: Bungie<br>Publisher: Bungie<br>Released: June 4, 2024<br>MSRP: $49.99</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s largest issue has been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ive-been-playing-destiny-2-wrong-for-nearly-a-decade/">the way its narrative is handled</a>. Between expansions that are feast or famine, the drip-fed Seasonal model, and burying 90% of it in lore entries with unlock requirements, <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s story is the best and worst part about it. For new players or those not invested in reading third-party sites like <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/">Ishtar Collective</a>, the odds are low for understanding just what’s going on.</p>
 <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true"><em>The Final Shape</em> unfortunately continues this trend. The campaign had the opportunity to bring together all of the disparate pieces and give players a unifying experience. Instead, we’re isolated inside the Pale Heart of the Traveler as Cayde-6 and Crow come to terms, Ikora does a whole lot of nothing, and Zavala’s <em>Season of the Haunted</em> schtick is back. Cinematics are sparse, there’s only one instance of more than two in-game characters being on screen together, and a heaping pile of sketched cutscenes doing much of the work.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">The first few days were a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch-was-a-cozy-callback-to-previous-expansions-for-the-wrong-reasons/">nightmare for servers</a>, with many players missing entire sections of the story, leading to a disjointed experience, and reaching the end of the campaign didn’t reveal anything beyond a comic-book explanation of how to defeat the Witness. </p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">It would be several days, a raid race, and a final mission before the story concluded. In the interim, the best parts of the story were relegated to what came after the campaign: unintentional filler. We’d been waiting a decade for this conclusion and Bungie couldn’t help milking it further.</p>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Once six players had cleared the arbitrary hurdle for the rest of us, we were able to finally take on the Witness (for real this time) in the 12-player matchmade Excision mission. Going into it, I was angry, disappointed, and all manner of dour. In the end, I was full of tears, overjoyed, and free.</p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">In a single mission, Excision, Bungie gave me what I had subconsciously been craving for over a year: closure. The developer didn’t do anything mind-blowing in terms of originality, but instead played its hand in the best possible way. By putting the last few pieces of the Light and Dark Saga puzzle in place, the studio gave players an impactful, emotional, and unforgettable conclusion. With my ship back in orbit, I had become <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m7SGjJo7c4">Anton Ego</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/destiny-2-the-final-shape-broken-ghost.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">In stark contrast to how <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s story has been handled over the years, the gameplay has always been nothing short of spectacular. Had that not been the case, I doubt <em>Destiny 2</em> would have survived its droughts. Rather than rest on its laurels, the developer rose to the challenge of creating the most engaging gameplay in memory.</p>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">During the developer ViDocs, the Prismatic subclass looked interesting but smacked of a gimmick. However, after spending time with it and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-refracting-prismatic-key-in-destiny-2/">unlocking additional Prismatic Fragments</a>, I’m not sure how I’d ever go back to a base Light or Dark subclass. This is a power fantasy I’ve not experienced since the 3.0 subclass reworks. It makes me feel like the fabled Guardian I’m meant to be. Finding synergy between varying subclass abilities takes build-crafting to another level and is sure to shake up prior content, breathing new life into things like dungeon and raid rotators.</p>
 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, <em>The Final Shape</em> integrates mechanics to a level usually reserved for content like dungeons and raids into nearly everything. It’s no longer a matter of putting enough bullets into an enemy or dealing with the occasional Champion. Moments like finding glyphs and passing debuffs between fireteam members are now commonplace, and put a greater emphasis on communication between Guardians. It can be a big ask for the socially anxious among us, but as someone working through it as well, I promise you that it’s worth the effort.</p>
 <p data-characters="588" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Ignoring the Taken and Scorn (because they’re largely reskins and zombie Fallen), we finally have a new enemy faction with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-dread-guide-how-to-beat-every-enemy/">the Dread</a>. Ranging from annoying to terrifying, these disciples of the Witness occupy a unique role in the forces of Darkness thanks to their ability to command Strand and Stasis. It turns out that being caught in a Tangle isn’t all that fun. Still, I’ll take that over the flying Grim who are fond of giving me tinnitus and bobbing around like a <em>Castlevania </em>Medusa. We’ve been begging for a new faction for years, and the wait was worth it.</p>
 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Finally, the Pale Heart of the Traveler is unique in that it’s a new destination, but one that is solely occupied by you. That’s right, every inch of Nostalgia Lane is devoid of other players, outside of a matchmade activity. It’s peculiar, as it makes the area lonely, but makes the space feel more personal. There’s plenty of variety in the environment and I’m quite fond of the area around the new hub. This environment seamlessly transitions from beautiful and serene to dark and twisted, beautifully mirroring our journey.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/destiny-2-the-final-shape-astronaut-solar.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="858" data-injectable="false">I came into <em>The Final Shape</em> expecting to be underwhelmed, and the launch reinforced that. However, as is the nature of live service games, it is possible to turn things around. I simply wished Bungie didn’t wait until the eleventh hour to wow us. <em>Destiny 2</em> has long been a game where many players have seen the potential and subsequently frustrated by decisions to deliver the minimum viable product. <em>The Final Shape</em> is the epitome of <em>Destiny</em> in many ways, both good and bad, Light and Dark, but I’ll be damned if Bungie didn’t pull it off.</p>

<p id="KcrXDq">The fourth feather is right before the second encounter, where you have to disable the cruxes. Once you reach the end, where both players are needed to open the door, turn around. The feather is right above the second-to-last darkness plate, which you can reach by using the small ledges around that plate.</p>

<p id="AhCFQN">The fifth feather is located after the second encounter. When you reach a large open room filled with trees, you’re in the right spot. Just before you exit the room, where you would go through the bright red doorway (shown above), turn to the right. The feather is deep within the branches of the tree. It is very dark in the corner, but there is a platform below the feather, even if you can’t see it.</p>

These are well-made books that look great as display pieces, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320173-81amcbyr1l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320173" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320173-81amcbyr1l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320173"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320173-81amcbyr1l._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320174-91xfjm2dqel._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320175-91jjyuy0yl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320176-714h9tjp5l._sl1350.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320177-61cidzclx-l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320178-71kr9ntjp2l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320174,1300-4320175,1300-4320176,1300-4320177,1300-4320178" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4320174-91xfjm2dqel._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4320175-91jjyuy0yl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4320176-714h9tjp5l._sl1350.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4320177-61cidzclx-l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4320178-71kr9ntjp2l._sl1500%281%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320174-91xfjm2dqel._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320175-91jjyuy0yl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320176-714h9tjp5l._sl1350.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320177-61cidzclx-l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320178-71kr9ntjp2l._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>For a humorous story set in The Lands Between, the ongoing Elden Ring manga is definitely worth checking out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-season-11-trailer-showcases-super-sentai-skins-sports-games-and-a-transformers-collab-tease/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=overwatch-2-season-11-trailer-showcases-super-sentai-skins-sports-games-and-a-transformers-collab-tease<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With<em> Overwatch 2</em> Season 11, Blizzard is continuing to try and lure me back with collaborations that scream my name. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRCMGpL_5-U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest trailer</a> showcases what’s coming to <em>Overwatch 2</em> this week, ranging from <em>Super Sentai</em>-inspired content to <em>Transformers</em>. </p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">I’m strong, and I have little time on my plate, so I’ll still resist the temptation to yeet hooks once again — though Blizzard hasn’t been making it easy. Somehow I managed to ignore the mind-blowing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-is-getting-a-cowboy-bebop-collab-so-im-reinstalling-overwatch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cowboy Bebop</em> collaboration</a> (I’m still so tempted). Now that the company is roping in <em>Transformers </em>and <em>Power Rangers</em> (sort of), I’m running low on excuses.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><em>Overwatch 2</em> Season 11 begins on June 20, and the new trailer showcases what’s involved. It’s a short, coming in at 3 minutes, but it’s jam-packed with new info covering skins, game modes, and the return of the Pink Mercy charity skin. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Season 11: Super Mega Ultrawatch Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRCMGpL_5-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-super-mega-ultrawatch-buddies-arrive-in-the-overwatch-2-premium-battle-pass" data-injectable="false">Super Mega Ultrawatch buddies arrive in the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>Premium Battle Pass</h2> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true">A new set of Premium Pass skins is arriving in Season 11, inspired by the famed <em>Super Sentai</em> television franchise that couldn’t stay locked only to Japan forever. Genji, Cassidy, Sojourn, Ana, and Wrecking Ball can all rock <em>Sentai</em>-themed Ultrawatch Legendary skins. In case you’re wondering, yes, it looks like there are Victory Poses inspired by the show, which means you can see Ana bust out a silly pose along with her allies.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Naturally, there can’t be heroes without villains. Ashe is taking on that role as “Calamity Empress Ashe,” who has a skin variant with Rita Repulsa-esque hair horns. <em>Excellent</em>. Zenyatta, Reaper, and Roadhog join Ashe with Kaiju skins. </p> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">Here’s everything that comes in the <em>Overwatch 2</em> Season 11 Premium Battle Pass (courtesy of Blizzard):</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false"> <li>Up to 80 Mythic Prisms</li> <li>5 Legendary Skins</li> <li>Lifeguard Lucio Epic Skin</li> <li>500 Credits</li> <li>Additional Rewards including Souvenirs, Weapon Charms, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes</li> <li>Everything in the Free Battle Pass including two additional Epic skins, 600 Overwatch Coins, an additional 1,500 Credits, and more</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-maps-masteries-and-the-return-of-the-pink-mercy-charity" data-injectable="false">Maps, Masteries, and the return of the Pink Mercy charity</h2> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">A new map enters the rotation in <em>Overwatch 2</em> Season 11. Runasapi is a push map that takes you to Peru, and will be available in Quick Play and Competitive when the season launches. Another Push Map, Colosseo, is getting a rework in Season 11. Blizzard announced that it removed the glass on the map following player feedback and added “a variety of other changes that will allow team fights to take place all over the streets of Rome.” </p>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">New Hero Mastery missions for Kiriko and Soldier: 76 are coming. According to Blizzard (Solider?), these will be part of a limited-time event that runs from June 20 to July 9. Playing the missions earns rewards and experience points that go toward the Battle Pass.</p> <figure data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">Pink Mercy’s return was announced late last week, but we’ll go over it for those who haven’t heard. Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-proceeds-from-new-overwatch-mercy-skin-will-be-donated-to-breast-cancer-research-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard sold a Pink Mercy skin</a> as part of a charity push for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The charity was incredibly successful, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/overwatchs-pink-mercy-skin-raised-over-12-7-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raising $12.7 million</a> for the foundation. <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104271/mercy-for-a-cause-pink-mercy-returns-in-support-of-the-breast-cancer-research-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pink Mercy has returned</a> along with a new Rose Gold Mercy bundle which are being sold for charity. Blizzard will send 100% of the profits once more to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</p>
 <h2 id="h-blizzard-teases-a-collab-between-overwatch-2-and-transformers" data-injectable="false">Blizzard teases a collab between <em>Overwatch 2</em> and <em>Transformers</em></h2> <p data-characters="588" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">If <em>Super Sentai</em> and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> aren’t enough to draw in those dwindling millennial dollars, Blizzard is teasing a <em>Transformers </em>collab for <em>Overwatch 2</em>. It’s probably better than a Porsche collab! At the end of the trailer, the <em>Overwatch 2</em> logo, well, <em>transforms</em> into the Autobot insignia — complete with the ear-tickling audio. The trailer doesn’t reveal much beyond the tease, so fans of the famed Hasbro franchise will have to use their imagination. I mean, Wrecking Ball and Bastion are obviously getting skins, right? They already have the transforming part down.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="false">There’s plenty more to come in Season 11. Reinhardt is getting a Mythic Bound Demon weapon skin that causes flames to erupt with every slam. We’ll also see the return of the Summer Games, along with lifeguard skins for multiple characters. The <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104272/when-the-forces-of-evil-rise-season-11-super-mega-ultrawatch-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog released by Blizzard</a> contains an in-depth rundown of everything you can expect. <em>Overwatch 2 </em>Season 11 begins on June 20 for those interested in striking goofy poses.</p>

<p id="Y9l3Jr">These discounted pre-orders grant all the same bonuses as the full-price version. Pre-ordering any edition of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> grants access to the Ring of Miquella gesture when the DLC launches.</p>

While the first trailer for <em>Life By You</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683">looked a lot like <em>The Sims</em></a></span>, Paradox Interactive promised that its spin on the genre would feature even more customization. Players would be able to not only change their clothing, appearance, and homes, but also to customize and control conversations and even career paths. Paradox Interactive also promised that<em> Life By You</em> would be highly moddable, too. However, players won’t get a chance to mod or play the life sim. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PdxInteractive/status/1802793181160825167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PdxInteractive/status/1802793181160825167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 17</a></span>, Paradox Interactive announced that <em>Life By You</em> had officially been canceled. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a statement posted on Paradox’s official forums</a></span>, the company’s deputy CEO Mattias Lilja confirmed the news.</p><p>“This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community’s expectations,” said Lilja. The deputy CEO further explained: <br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Life by You</em> has been in the works for a long time and we’ve been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game. Our hope was always that it would be able to leave a mark in this exciting and new genre for us. That’s why we’ve opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realizing the potential we saw. For each delay we made, we’ve seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture.</p></blockquote><p>As mentioned in the post, on May 20, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/2-weeks-before-its-early-access-release-life-by-you-is-delayed-again-this-time-without-a-new-date/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/2-weeks-before-its-early-access-release-life-by-you-is-delayed-again-this-time-without-a-new-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Life By You </em>was delayed</a></span> just two weeks before its planned early access launch. No new release date was given at the time. Now we know that, according to the deputy CEO, after delaying the release again and taking a “wider view of the game,” it became clear that the studio still had a long way to go. </p><p>“When we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop,” said Lilja. “This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.”<br></p><p>As for what Paradox will do differently in the future to avoid such last-minute delays and cancelations, Lilja was honest and transparent, saying there is no guarantee that this won’t happen again, but the studio will still try to avoid this outcome moving forward. </p><p>“Games are difficult to get right,” said Lilja. “And we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Think about it: the <em>Dragon Age </em>fandom hasn’t had a game to dissect, anticipate, or scrutinize since <em>Inquisition</em> launched in 2014. <em>The Veilguard</em>, which is set to finally wrap up the devastating cliffhanger of <em>Inquisition</em>’s <em>Trespasser </em>DLC, is just a few short months away, and after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">name change</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">cinematic trailer</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144">gameplay reveal</a></span>, fans finally have something substantial to chew on, rather than sustaining themselves with comics, short stories, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-absolution-trailer-dreadwolf-inquisition-1849769805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-absolution-trailer-dreadwolf-inquisition-1849769805">a Netflix anime</a></span>. Having watched BioWare fans go through some tough times between <em>Inquisition</em> and <em>The Veilguard</em>, it’s heartening to see the explosion of fan art, theories, and love outpouring from every side of the internet in anticipation of the next chapter. But that anticipation is tinged with a bit of fear. After waiting all this time, what happens if <em>The Veilguard</em> doesn’t live up to the game someone has imagined for ten years? Worse yet, what happens to BioWare if it has what some might consider its third “strike”?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Now, <em>The Veilguard </em>is being marketed as a streamlined, single-player, micotransaction-less action RPG. It seems like BioWare has its priorities straight, but it also sounds like <em>The Veilguard </em>exists in the form it did after the studio and publisher Electronic Arts got it wrong twice in a row. That’s what makes it easier to get excited about the fourth game. BioWare has said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-discord-q-a-banter-party-members-1851541486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-discord-q-a-banter-party-members-1851541486">a lot of the right things</a></span> in just the past two weeks since Summer Game Fest. <em>The Veilguard </em>went from a mostly conceptual idea in <em>Dragon Age </em>fans’ heads to something very close to what those fans have been asking for since party-member-turned-villain Solas announced his plans to watch the world burn in <em>Trespasser</em>.<br></p><p>Of course, it’s also been divisive. <em>Dragon Age </em>has shifted subgenres throughout the past 15 years, but <em>The Veilguard </em>is more of an overt action RPG than even <em>Dragon Age II </em>was in 2011. So naturally those who are pining for the tactics-driven gameplay of the series’ first game, <em>Origins</em>, have taken issue with BioWare’s acrobatic gameplay showcase, especially <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955">on the heels of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s success last year</a></span>. Look, it would not be a BioWare game if it didn’t also invite some of the most vitriolic online discourse known to man. But after seeing the studio go from chasing bloated open-world trends to making a live-service loot shooter in the past seven years, seeing BioWare make a game that is trimming all that away to get at the heart of what the studio has always done well has reignited excitement for the studio again. I’ll admit, watching <em>The Veilguard</em>’s behind-closed-doors presentation at Summer Game Fest got me welled up in a way that’s only happened a few times in my career.</p><p>The thing is, BioWare fans never really venture too far while their favorite series is on hiatus. If nothing else, the studio did a good job leading into <em>The Veilguard </em>through extended media like comics and short stories to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">introduce characters</a></span> the studio was working on for the fourth game. In fact, a few of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s party members have been waiting for their grand introduction for years. So fans have had time to get a sense of who new characters like Neve the detective mage and Lucanis the mage-killing assassin are long before they showed up in a video game. </p><p>Fans may come to love those new characters, but at the same time, <em>The Veilguard </em>is bringing people back to a story they’ve waited a decade to see through. BioWare is clearly aware of just how invested these eager fans are, and is playing with their expectations and years-long investment. How do you hook a fandom that’s been dying to see a story wrapped up for 10 years? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">Put one of their favorites in danger</a></span> in an angsty shouting match <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/chailottie/status/1800559633603367255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/chailottie/status/1800559633603367255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">between him and an old friend</a></span>. Tug on their heartstrings and remind them of all the choices they’ve made over the past three games, knowing it was all leading to this moment. Give them something to project their own journeys onto.</p><p>With all the strife <em>The Veilguard </em>has reportedly gone through in its multiple iterations, fans seem relieved to see that, based on what BioWare has shown, a lot of the original vision still seems to remain intact. Case in point: Fans have been scouring old teasers for clues, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/biomarkdarrah/status/725022641623437312?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/biomarkdarrah/status/725022641623437312?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2016 post by then-producer Mark Darrah</a></span> (now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/mark-darrah-rejoins-dragon-age-team-and-mass-effect-studio-will-help-polish-the-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/mark-darrah-rejoins-dragon-age-team-and-mass-effect-studio-will-help-polish-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on the project as a consultant</a></span>) has caught the attention of <em>Dragon Age</em> diehards. It shows Darrah looking through what seems to be a design booklet for the game with a rook chess piece on the cover. Rook is the name of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s main character.</p><p>While <em>The Veilguard </em>seems to be prioritizing continuity and payoff, the road to arriving at this current vision for the game has been tumultuous, to say the least. BioWare’s turnover in the past decade hasn’t gone unnoticed, and the studio even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-4-bioware-layoffs-1850766754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-4-bioware-layoffs-1850766754">laid off 50 developers</a></span> last year, including veterans like writer Mary Kirby, who had been a key creative force behind the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. The studio has also been at the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-bioware-layoffs-lawsuit-ea-1850900755&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-bioware-layoffs-lawsuit-ea-1850900755">center of a legal battle</a></span> over severance owed to laid-off employees. Even as some key leadership has stayed at the studio, BioWare has lost <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859">some of the major players</a></span> that helped make some of its most celebrated games what they were.</p><p>With all those key players gone, it’s a studio at a turning point, one that could aim to stay true to the work done by those who have gone before, or chart out new paths of its own, or find some happy medium between the two, honoring that legacy while also venturing into new territory. What we’ve seen of <em>The Veilguard </em>suggests that it’s aiming to do the latter, and it feels like a leap of faith for BioWare after all this time.</p><p>There’s a lot riding on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. The stakes are high for the series, which fans have been dying to return to for so long. They may be higher for BioWare itself, though hopefully, with this release, a studio that we’ve all collectively watched stumble into the modern era can right the ship as it navigates the tumultuous shores of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">this incredible volatile industry</a></span>. I’m excited and terrified to find out when <em>Dragon Age</em> returns this fall.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
