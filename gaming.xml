		<p>How nice it was to have an entire weekend where my frequently frustrating football team simply didn't play! What a joy! But we'll be back to a world of nightmares this weekend. In the meantime, when I asked someone to build the scheduling graphic for this week, I wasn't anticipating we'd get something as snazzy as what Rob and Connor Fawcett, would helped design the entire visual language of <em>Remap</em>, had cooked up below. Planning for a live show tends to help get some projects over the finish line, but I'll have more to say about that soon...!</p><p>-pk, who attended a haunted house this weekend and it was delightful</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>NEXT WEEK – </strong><em>HOA:</em> I need to  build a real home office, so I'm recruiting a super team to help me figure out what I need to buy for a proper home studio. We'll also be doing a stream next week where we mess round with room layouts! Who want to join in researching what lights I should put in the ceiling?</li><li><strong>STREAM </strong>– <em>FC 25:</em> From what I can understand, this is a stream where people question Rob's decision to randomly start cheering for Manchester United?</li><li><strong>WATCH</strong> – <em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em>: The wheel turns once more, as we are rewarded (??) for watching Megalopolis by getting a chance with vampires. </li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – I've finished up a few spooky games on stream that I'm anxious to talk about, and by recording, I'll have beaten <em>Neva</em>.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> Spookin' With Patrick – We finished <em>Mouthwashing</em> and <em>Unsorted Horror</em>, which has me thinking this week should be <em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em>.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Volgarr the Viking</em> – <em>Nextlander</em>'s Brad Shoemaker is back home, which means it's time to bash our heads against this game all over again.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> It's not on the schedule, but like usual, we'll have another letter series.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

And one of those features is the addition of smoothies!</p><p>Made at any of the smoothie shops around Hyrule, Zelda can mix up some delicious drinks by combining ingredients she’s found during your travels. These smoothies—of which there are an astonishing 70—can provide you with everything from simple heart replenishment to special effects like heat and cold resistance. Below, we’ll list our favorite smoothies that we think you should keep in your flask.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After creating a smoothie for the first time, you can go to any smoothie shop and opt to pay a premium to repurchase the same drink without using the ingredients, allowing you to keep a selection of smoothies on hand even if you don’t have the necessary materials to remake them. However, this costs a <em>lot</em> of rupees, so we don’t recommend making a habit of it. Stick to using ingredients when possible.</p><p>Click on to read the best smoothies in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-recommend-id="image://4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-recommend-id="image://4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Tough Mango + Golden Egg</p><p>The Golden Tough Smoothie makes use of exceedingly rare Golden Eggs to create a tasty treat that not only replenishes 20 hearts but also boosts your defense for five minutes. It’s a great idea to have a few of these around—but use them sparingly against only the toughest bosses to ensure you’re not left wanting when it matters most. Making more of these can be expensive.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-recommend-id="image://8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-recommend-id="image://8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Fresh Milk + Electro Apple</p><p>Sometimes you just need quick health recovery without exhausting too many of your rare resources or rupees, and the basic Mixed Milky Smoothie will get the job done just fine. By combining two relatively common ingredients, this smoothie nets you a solid recovery of 13 hearts, so that you can stay in the fight longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-recommend-id="image://e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-recommend-id="image://e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Fresh Milk + Rock Salt</p><p>Replenishing your hearts is usually the main reason for slurping down a smoothie, but what if you could also get back some energy while you’re at it? That’s where the Salted Milky Smoothie comes in. This drink gives you 10 hearts while also fully filling your energy meter, so that you can whoop ass with your sword some more. Sick.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4b4ea2bcdacf1cfbde65b8bb439fcc86" data-recommend-id="image://4b4ea2bcdacf1cfbde65b8bb439fcc86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b4ea2bcdacf1cfbde65b8bb439fcc86" data-recommend-id="image://4b4ea2bcdacf1cfbde65b8bb439fcc86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Monster Guts + Chilly Cactus</p><p>The Chilly Potion is less a smoothie and more a, well, potion—but it serves its purpose well by providing you with five full minutes of being fireproof. This is especially useful when exploring Eldin Volcano later in the game, so you should definitely stock up on these to make your lava diving experience a bit less toasty.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f86dbd374f8e168ccda8479483fd2954" data-recommend-id="image://f86dbd374f8e168ccda8479483fd2954" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f86dbd374f8e168ccda8479483fd2954" data-recommend-id="image://f86dbd374f8e168ccda8479483fd2954" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Monster Fang + Warm Pepper</p><p>If the Chilly Potion is all about keeping you cool, the Warming Potion is all about keeping you warm by making you chill-proof for five minutes. You’ll want to stockpile plenty of these when you begin your trek up Hebra Mountain, as it’s filled with snow. You can’t build a snowman if you can’t feel your fingers, you know.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="283a30f89e34c4cb8c2200b576726d7f" data-recommend-id="image://283a30f89e34c4cb8c2200b576726d7f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="283a30f89e34c4cb8c2200b576726d7f" data-recommend-id="image://283a30f89e34c4cb8c2200b576726d7f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Monster Guts + Electro Apple</p><p>The last status-effect protection potion is the Electro Potion, which does pretty much what you’d expect—it protects you against lightning attacks for five minutes. This is very useful when going up against irritating lightning-based foes like Electric Wizzrobes or Electric Keese, essentially nullifying their attacks so that you can get in and take ‘em out.</p><hr><p>If you’re eager to learn more about what to expect in Zelda’s newest adventure, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-how-long-difficulty-co-op-1851658225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-how-long-difficulty-co-op-1851658225">here’s everything you need to know</a></span>.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Steam Deck will not get yearly iterations a la the iPhone, according to one of its designers, though a Steam Deck 2 will likely happen at some point.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reviews.org</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275604/dont-expect-a-new-steam-deck-to-drop-each-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said, "We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that." He elaborated that he felt it was unfair to customers to offer only incremental improvements each year. He said, "...we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck."</p><p>This answer matches prior statements Valve has made. On several occasions last year, Valve employees stated that a more powerful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-deck-2-is-still-years-away/1100-6519084/" data-ref-id="1100-6519084">Steam Deck will be years away</a>--late 2025 at the earliest. Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais explained that part of the Steam Deck brand (at least for now) is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-have-to-wait-at-least-two-years-for-a-faster-steam-deck/1100-6517933/" data-ref-id="1100-6517933">every model can play the same games</a>; Valve doesn't want to change that until Steam Deck performance gets a significant boost without losing battery life. Later in the interview, Yang did note that Valve is working on a Steam Deck successor.</p><p>The Steam Deck did get an upgrade last year in the form of the Steam Deck OLED, which improves battery life and the display quality. The Steam Deck's popularity has resulted in a variety of competitors, including the Asus ROG Ally, which got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support/1100-6525778/" data-ref-id="1100-6525778">SteamOS support in August.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access Cancelled by Ubisoft]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-early-access-cancelled/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-early-access-cancelled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was supposed to be released on November 15, but thanks to a considerable delay, it was pushed back to February 14. Then, the game’s branding was washed with a fresh dose of hot water following some design controversies tied to some merchandise, and <strong>now </strong>Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of any early access to the game.</p>



<p>It’s still a pretty highly anticipated title, but it’s proving to be quite a slog just to get hands-on with the end product.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-changes">Making Changes</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Discord server</a>, an official Q&amp;A session revealed new details about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows collector’s edition, which is a super-sized bundle originally priced at almost $300. </p>



<p>Per the Q&amp;A session, some monumental changes have been made:</p>



<ul>
<li>The early access portion of the offering has been <strong>cancelled</strong>. It will now be released on February 14 alongside the base game</li>



<li>The game’s season pass has been scrapped, so this will understandably <strong>not </strong>be included with the collector’s edition as planned</li>
</ul>



<p>These changes reflect an alteration in the game’s pricing. It has gone from around $279 to $229. It was also explained by Ubisoft that further changes might be made to the collector’s edition’s aesthetic, statue, steelbook, art book, and so on.</p>



<p>These changes might be inspired by the issues Ubisoft has had thus far maintaining historical accuracy and cultural representation. Further scandals in that area could be the final nail in the coffin for this game from a PR standpoint.</p>



<p>The Gold Edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also planned to be released three days early and go hand-in-hand with a season pass, but given these recent comments, it’s almost guaranteed that the price of <strong>that edition </strong>will also drop, as will the digital offering and early access window.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Few games have ever been in development as long as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-has-been-purchased-by-over-1-million-players/1100-6508145/" data-ref-id="1100-6508145">Star Citizen</a> has, with its 12-years-and-counting cycle. But Star Citizen's standalone spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizens-single-player-game-squadron-42-delay/1100-6444340/" data-ref-id="1100-6444340">Squadron 42</a>, comes close with 10 years since the game was announced. At this year's CitizenCon 2954, Cloud Imperium stopped short of saying that Squadron 42 will have a definite release date in 2026. But Cloud Imperium CEO Chris Roberts did say that he was "confident" it would be released in two years.</p><p>To back up his claim, Roberts presented an hour-long gameplay demo of Squadron 42, which had a few crashes along the way. But it did show off the Wing Commander-inspired gameplay and intense sci-fi action. There are also plenty of cutscenes in the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H-0x4xk2Xk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1H-0x4xk2Xk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A lot of celebrity talent has lent their voices and likenesses to the game, including Wing Commander star--and Star Wars icon--Mark Hamill, as well as Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Henry Cavill, Gillian Anderson, Mark Strong, Jack Huston, Ben Mendelsohn, and more. Cloud Imperium certainly had the budget to attract that A-list talent, since Squadron 42 and Star Citizen have raised over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$700 million in crowdfunding</a> since 2012.</p><p>Prior to CitizenCon 2954, Cloud Imperium reportedly forced its employees into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-is-forcing-employees-to-work-seven-days-a-week-report/1100-6526879/" data-ref-id="1100-6526879">a seven-day-a-week crunch-style schedule</a> to make its deadlines for the convention. Even with that extra effort, the demo had a buggy performance, and Roberts apologized for the crashes. Squadron 42 was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squadron-42-is-now-feature-complete-after-10-years-of-development-see-new-footage-here/1100-6518577/" data-ref-id="1100-6518577">as "feature-complete" at last year's CitizenCon</a>, but clearly a lot of work remains to be done.</p><p>As for Star Citizen, Cloud Imperium's flagship title is still in alpha, with no projected release date in sight. However, Cloud Imperium did offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-now-selling-48000-bundle-that-includes-every-ship/1100-6520120/" data-ref-id="1100-6520120">a massive $48,000 bundle with every ship</a> in the game earlier this year. Hopefully someday, players will get a full game to go along with all of those ships.</p>

It's been nearly two years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> first surfaced, immediately dazzling the world with his distinctive underwater exploration/sushi restaurant management charms, but developer Mintrocket isn't done yet; the studio has now confirmed a story expansion is on the way, and perhaps even spin-off games for each of Dave's pals.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Dave the Diver creator and director Jaeho Hwang, who shared the news with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dave-the-divers-creator-wants-to-create-a-dave-cinematic-universe-of-games/">VGC</a> during Singapore's recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Asia. "I want to expand Dave the Diver IP itself," he explained of the studio's future plans. "I think that's every director's dream, since we have a relatable character." Hwang (who also serves as Mintrocket's CEO) added while the base game "didn't go really deep into the personal stories in Dave the Diver, because we wanted to keep the game very casual", he wants to start filling in some of those blanks.
</p>
<p>
It seems at least some of that will happen in "the story DLC [Mintrocket is] working on right now", but Hwang said he also wants to make "separate games about each character to show how they met, what they did before coming to the Blue Hole." He noted there's some precedent for this already, albeit in reverse, given Dave the Diver character Cobra's backstory is technically told in Evil Factory, one of Hwang's earlier games.

<p>
Hwang added spin-offs focussing on different characters could give the studio a chance to explore new genres within the Dave the Diver universe, and maybe visit Dave the Diver at a time in his life he had a different profession. "He's always been a diver," he continued, "so we really haven't thought about how we should move with Dave... I really want to show how he grew up, and how he became a diver, and how he ended up coming to the Blue Hole."
</p><p>
To date, Dave the Diver - which has sold over 4m copies since launching last year - has received three bits of post-launch DLC: the Digital Extra expansion feature various cosmetics, plus a digital art book and soundtrack, as well as a free Dredge collaboration and another focused on Godzilla. Hawng offered no hint as to when Mintrocket might be done with Dave the Diver's story DLC, but it should provide the perfect excuse to revise an already stellar game.
</p>
<p>
"Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is Eurogamer described Dave the Diver in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">five star review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."

		<p>Bandai Namco and Rebel Wolves have announced a publishing partnership agreement today, with Bandai Namco set to publish Rebel Wolves’ first game. That game is going to be a AAA action RPG called Dawnwalker, and it is supposed to be start of a new gaming saga. Rebel Wolves was founded in 2022 by the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves’ Tomasz Tinc said about the agreement, <em>“Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our Wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself. We’re looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide.”</em></p>


<p>Alberto Gonzalez Lorca VP for Business Development at Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, said, <em>“This is another key milestone in our content development strategy for the Western market. By combining our strengths, we will deliver this first game of the studio to a worldwide audience. We’re excited with the universe being created by Rebel Wolves thanks to their extremely talented team of developers, resulting in a great addition to our portfolio.”</em></p>
<p>Not much is known about Dawnwalker, except that it will be set in Medieval Europe, will be an action RPG and will lean into dark fantasy. One of the things <a href="https://rebel-wolves.com/#section-services">Rebel Wolves has written on its website</a> about Dawnwalker is that it wants to give player’s more agency within games. The quote says, <em>“Our goal is to give you plenty of ways to solve a problem and then let you have a go at it. There will be no right or wrong way to play the game – it’ll be up to you to decide what is your way.”</em></p>

<p>There is currently no release date for Dawnwalker, though the confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has two story-centric modes: Episode and Bonus Battles. Bonus Battles are a set of missions created by developers revolving around some unique scenarios. Completing Bonus Battles will also award players additional new characters, Zeni, XP and Ability Items in Sparking Zero. Check out this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Bonus Battles Guide for more details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players will find 37 Bonus Battles in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero; some are locked initially. Most battles are straightforward; players must defeat enemies to finish the mission. However, some battles need players to meet special conditions to win the mission. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Bonus Battles Guide will take you through all the missions with special requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Check out the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-episode-battles-guides-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guides Hub</a>&nbsp;for details on branching storylines and alternate endings for all characters of this game mode.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-master-roshi-s-training">Master Roshi’s Training</h2>



<p>In this Sparking Zero Bonus Battle, players have to train with Master Roshi as Kid Goku, and the mission can only be won by proving your training. The way to do this is by paying attention to Master Roshi’s dialogues, and he will mention which super or ultimate attack players must use as Kid Goku to defeat Roshi and win this battle. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-welcome-to-frieza-force">Welcome to Frieza Force!</h2>



<p>Players have to defeat every character with Nappa to win this Bonus Battle in Sparking Zero, and the lineup includes Frieza Force Soldier, Cui, Dodoria, Zarbon and Frieza himself. However, players aren’t allowed to use their Ultimate Attack against Frieza. If you use your Ultimate, Frieza will get annoyed and destroy the planet. If you don’t use your ultimate, Frieza will acknowledge your strength and recruit you to the Frieza Force.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-body-change-turns-the-tables">Body Change Turns the Tables!</h2>



<p>In this Sparking ZeroBnus Battle, players start off as a tired Ginyu, who Frieza has challenged. You start at a very low health, and the only way to win is by performing Ginyu’s Ultimate Move, Body Change.&nbsp;To complete this mission quickly, players should use SP Fighting Pose 5, which can be performed by Pressing R2/RT + Up Arrow on the D-pad. This will put you in Sparking! More, allowing you to use your Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Frieza can one-shot you during this period, so remember to block. Once you have used the Body Change, defeat Frieza in Ginyu’s body as Ginyu in Frieza’s body to complete this mission.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-late-onset-madness">Late-Onset Madness</h2>



<p>In this Bonus Battle, you must defeat Goku as Vegeta without using any Ki, only punches and kicks. That means no Super or Ultimate attacks, transformations, or going into Sparking! Mode. You will only have to defeat Goku with the help of combos only.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-battle-of-speed-defeat-beerus">A Battle of Speed! Defeat Beerus!</h2>



<p>In this Sparking Zero Bonus Battle, Vegeta goes over to Beerus to ask for training. Beerus says he will help but will finish Vegeta off if he gets bored. He is not joking about the boring part; if he gets bored, he will finish off Vegeta in a second. &nbsp;To keep Beerus entertained, you need to inflict a lot of damage. Every 30 seconds, players will have to take off a significant chunk of Beerus’ health to keep them from getting bored. If he gets bored, he will one-shot you with his ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how do you defeat him? Players will need to inflict steady damage on Beerus; literally, don’t give him time to breathe. As base Vegeta, players should use as many combos as possible until they can enter Sparking Mode and then hit Beerus with a Final Flash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, once you have excess Skill Stocks, transform to Super Saiyan Vegeta and start pummelling Beerus again. However, during the battle, Beerus also keeps healing himself and adds health bars. When you have the window, enter Sparking Mode again, inflict Sparking Combos until the last bit of Ki is left and then use the Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transformations add buffs to your damage, so players should consider transforming into Super Saiyan God Vegeta and keep up the combos. However, you must enter Sparking Mode again, inflict as much damage as possible, and then use the Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Dragon Dash is a helpful movement mechanic for this fight, as Beerus will be evasive, and this move will help you quickly cover a lot of distance. To perform the Super Dragon Dash, press and hold R2/RT and double tap X/A. This will make Vegeta enter a high-speed rush and land directly at the back of Beerus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another thing you should keep in mind is the dialogue; if Beerus says he is getting bored, you are getting sloppy, and you need to increase the speed at which you are inflicting damage. If he acknowledges Vegeta’s strength, you are on the right track. This is a difficult battle and might require a couple of retries.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-god-vs-god">God vs. God</h2>



<p>In this Bonus Battle, Beerus and Whis travel with Goku and Vegeta to fight Black and Zamasu. Players must defeat Zamasu and Black to win this battle using only Vegeta and Goku. You can let Beerus join in, but he can’t inflict too much damage, or you will lose the battle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beerus can’t join in because Whis tells him at the start of the mission that a God of Destruction can’t meddle with time, and the Saiyans will have to handle it themselves. A great way to go about it is to use Goku and Vegeta to the limit, defeating Black and bringing Zamasu’s health to the last bar or defeating him altogether. If you switch to Beerus at the last health bar, you can still defeat Zamasu and win the battle; however, using Beerus to inflict more damage than that will lead to losing the fight.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-in-search-of-powerful-rivals-conclusion-nbsp">In Search of Powerful Rivals: Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are two endings to this Sparking Zero Bonus Battle. In the first ending, players need to survive long enough in front of Beerus, and he will switch out with Goku, who will then fight Cell in his base form. However, if you can defeat Beerus quickly, a new ending will be triggered, where Goku will come and battle Cell in his Mastered Ultra Instinct form.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Amazon and Games Workshop have revealed fresh details about their Secret Level Warhammer 40,000 episode, confirming it’s a sequel to the recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level">Secret Level</a> is an animated anthology series made up of 15 independent episodes, each based on a game. It’s created by some of the people behind Netflix’s animated anthology series <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/love-death-and-robots">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a>, and is set to launch on Prime Video on December 10.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2iuskcvl/secret-level-warhammer-animation-news-out-of-new-york-comic-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop pointed out that executive producer and supervising director Dave Wilson was responsible for one of the first ever Warhammer animations, the iconic opening to the original <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a> real-time strategy game. That <a href="https://youtu.be/_oqr06cHAGw?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening cinematic</a>, now 20 years old, is hugely popular among Warhammer 40,000 fans and is often held up as one of the best Warhammer 40,000 animations ever created.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Perhaps of most interest is the Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode’s link to Saber Interactive’s record-breaking Space Marine 2. First up, Games Workshop confirmed actor Clive Standen’s return as Ultramarines lieutenant Titus, the protagonist of the game.</p><p>“Players of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will have already clocked the iconic figure of Lieutenant Titus in the initial teaser trailer released back in August,” Games Workshop said. “Today it has just been confirmed that the indomitable Clive Standen is reprising his leading role as the voice of Titus in this new animation.”</p><p>Games Workshop then confirmed this Secret Level animation is “a sequel to Space Marine 2,” even going as far as teasing that it follows on directly from the events of the game’s campaign.</p><p>“Yes, that’s Titus and what’s that fancy laurel on his helmet?” Games Workshop said. “If you’ve completed the game, then you already know! This animation follows the conclusion of the video game like a... secret level.”</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Space Marine 2 spoilers follow.</em></p><p>So, what could this mean? Space Marine 2 ends with Titus vindicated having joined forces with Ultramarines Chapter Master Marneus Calgar to defeat the forces of Chaos. Calgar awards Titus with a new helmet adorned with the Imperial Laurel before calling upon him to take on a mysterious mission. Presumably that’s where Secret Level picks up. (You can check out the ending of Space Marine 2 in the video below.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Secret Level hits Prime Video on December 10 and includes episodes based on everything from Sony's Concord to Epic's Unreal. The Warhammer 40,000 episode is in the first salvo alongside seven others. The rest of the series drops a week later on December 17.</p><p>As for a continuation of the Space Marine 2 story in video game form, Saber has remained coy on the possibility of campaign DLC, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">it’s admitted it already has ideas floating around for the seemingly inevitable Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 15 Tips For Playing COD: Black Ops 6 As An Older Gamer</p>
      </div>
<p>The riot shield can be particularly frustrating to run up against in matches due to its ability to deflect incoming fire, prompting enemies to have to change their strategy to take down the shield-users. Skilled players who successfully utilize the riot shield can sway the flow of any given match, especially so in certain modes like Hardpoint and Domination. Fans of the riot shield, meanwhile, say it brings a new level of strategy and meta-game to the mix.</p><p>In any event, some amongst the Call of Duty fanbase have called for its removal for years, but it remains to be seen why Activision isn't including it in Black Ops 6. The developer did not provide any commentary around why the riot shield is being left out this time around.</p><p>It's always possible that Black Ops 6 could bring the riot shield to the game through an update in the future, as numerous more weapons, attachments, and field upgrades are expected to come to the game over the course of its seasons.</p><p>Black Ops 6 will have a shield of sorts at launch, as the game allows players to use players as a "meat shield" similar to the long-running feature in the Gears of War games. If a player can successfully sneak up behind an enemy, they can choose to use them as a body shield for a period of time, or execute them immediately.</p><p>While Black Ops 6 is dropping the riot shield, it's bringing back the Last Stand perk--sort of. It's returning in the form of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-brings-back-last-stand-but-not-how-youd-expect/1100-6527267/" data-ref-id="1100-6527267">field upgrade called Morphine Injector</a>, and it's likely to spark some debate of its own.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and it will also be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">available through Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</a>.

			<p>Empire of the Ants, the upcoming Unreal Engine 5 real-time strategy game based on a French sci-fi book, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the PS5 Pro launch lineup</a>, being scheduled to release on the same day (November 7).</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshly published interview</a> with developer Tower Five, Game Director Renaud Charpentier shared impressions on Sony's upcoming mid-generation console refresh. According to Charpentier, due to how games are made nowadays compared to the previous generation, PS5 games could take better advantage of the PS5 Pro hardware compared to PS4 Pro and PS4. Most titles nowadays also include variable resolution, offering even more scaling potential. Empire of the Ants won't support PlayStation Spectral Resolution because it came too late in the game's development phase. As for the comparison with PC, Charpentier noted that the two cannot be directly compared since a top-of-the-line PC costs between three and five times, and also consumes a lot more energy.</p>

<p><em><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It is a kind of natural evolution of the PS5 hardware, same paradigms but more processing power on the GPU and "ray tracing" cores. For us, the gain of about 50% more GPU processing power is the most interesting of course, as our game is GPU bound, not CPU bound.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is less pronounced)?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It seems comparable in terms of evolution philosophy. It is the same gen console but with better rendering capacities. Now, it is early and so hard to compare what the PS5 Pro will do for PS5 games to what the PS4 Pro did for PS4 games. But globally, it seems many games will go from 30 to 60 fps on the Pro version, and that's comparable to what we had on PS4 Pro. It will probably scale better for an engine version: most games today do not rely on frame rate to sync/time their simulations. So they are more capable of rendering faster without altering their behaviors.</em></p>
<p><em>On PlayStation 4, you still had fantastic games like Bloodborne, where the game can't run above 30 because the simulation is linked to the rendering. So if you don't modify the engine and render at 60 fps, then your game will run twice faster, all the game, so everything will be twice faster for the player. Such frame rate bound simulations were still relatively common in the PS4 era, and they made taking advantage of a GPU upscale much harder. So, possibly, PlayStation 5 games will take better advantage of the PS5 Pro's capacities. The fact that most games nowadays use a form of variable resolution also helps with scaling up the quality with the GPU.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>As said and as presented by Sony, it is expected that most games will double their frame rate on the Pro or improve scene quality if they were already running in 60 on a PS5. Still, maxed out PCs are kind of "no limit" so they will of course be more powerful, but you can't compare them. A maxed out PC is going to cost easily 3 to 5 times more and consume 3 to 5 times more electrical energy. But what is interesting and says a lot about the flattening silicon evolution curve is that your game on your monster PC is not going to look or play 3 to 5 times better than on a PS5 Pro console. There is a huge diminishing return now on high end silicon, and that might have an impact on the life cycle duration of console hardware.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will there be different modes for the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Empire of the Ants?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>No, there is a single 60 FPS mode, so double the frame rate of the PlayStation 5 version.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Are you using PSSR in Empire of the Ants?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We don't. It came very late in our development cycle for this game, so we stuck to the</em><br>
<em>Unreal equivalent.</em></p>

Unlike the asymmetrical layout of the sticks on the GameCube’s controller, the CubeSense’s analog sticks sit side by side.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption><em>Play like it’s 2001 again.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Killscreen</cite></p></div></div><p>Killscreen offers additional customizations for the CubeSense. For $169, you can opt to swap out the DualSense’s standard triggers and bumpers with clicky alternatives that have shorter travel to improve response times while playing FPS games. You can also opt to upgrade the DualSense’s rubber membrane face buttons with microswitches so they have more of a clicky feel when pressed for $169, but if you want all of the controller’s buttons upgraded, that pushes the CubeSense’s price tag to $179.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gangstalk is a cat-and-mouse game in which you play both cat and mouse. It's a stalking game in which you are the person stalking you and also, you are the person being stalked. By you. Yes, I too am wearing an expression of puppy-eyed dismay and confusion. But it sounds interesting, sufficiently interesting that I can disregard the very loud DYSTOPIAN WORLD framing in the trailer.</p>

<p>Devised by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592360/Kitten_Burst/">Kitten Burst</a> developer Jam2go, Gangstalk is the tale of Cam, an urban explorer in a high-vis jacket with an emoji for a face. He's being hounded by the evil megacorp PANDO, who appear to specialise in the manufacture of digital ghosts. Or at least, he thinks he is. According to Wikipedia, gangstalking refers to "a set of persecutory beliefs in which those affected believe they are being followed, stalked, and harassed by a large number of people." So it's possible that all this is happening in Cam's poor befuddled noggin.</p>
<p>As the game begins, Cam has infiltrated a secret PANDO company town, Kudzu Vale, which reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blackout-club">The Blackout Club</a>'s ghoulish chunk of suburbia. There are hauntingly empty carparks, hauntingly empty shopping markets, and haunting pieces of high-concept scenery, like piles of smouldering TVs or gaggles of marionettes who definitely won't move when you look away. Active threats include predatory phantasms called Datamoshers, who look like Slender Men made of VHS crackly bits. But the intriguing part, again, is the whole "you are your own stalker" conceit.</p><p>In lieu of a generic camera system you will watch Cam "through the fragmented perspectives of CCTV Cameras, Devices, Agents, and the enigmatic Datamoshers". Sometimes, you're peeking through a CCTV camera in the corner, with the view rotating jerkily to follow him/you across the room. Sometimes, you're the horror chasing him/yourself, wobbling along as he/you disappear around corners, whereupon you'll presumably have to wait for yourself to catch up in order to keep... escaping from yourself. </p>
<p>While showing a soon-to-be victim from the killer's vantage is a familiar tactic, I feel like Gangstalk is trying to push beyond that clichéd cinematic device. It's teaching you to fear your own gaze, which poses a fun practical dilemma. Presumably, you'll have to walk the line throughout the game of being <em>just</em> visible enough to retain control.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3235140/GANGSTALK/">The Steam page</a> contains a note warning about "strong depictions of anxiety and paranoia", and this is certainly one of the fancier takes on such things I've stumbled on in a video game. I can imagine some ways it won't measure up to its potential, mind you. Perhaps the "stalker POV" stuff will just boil down to classic survival horror fixed vantage points, much of the time. Perhaps it'll just be laughable in practice. Perhaps it being laughable is the point. We'll find out sometime next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You <em>may</em> run into this issue a little bit while traveling through the mines with Strohl and Grius early in the game, but you’ll <em>certainly </em>run out of MP if you try to clear the Grand Cathedral in a single sitting (as I did).<br></p><p>The first thing you’ll need to use this technique is access to the Mage archetype. The Hero Passive ability for the Mage is Magic Recovery, which recovers a little MP every time an enemy is stunned or defeated <strong>in overworld combat</strong>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-recommend-id="image://bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-recommend-id="image://bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That qualifier is extremely important, because it refers to striking enemies with an attack as you run around the dungeon, <em>not</em> going into the turn-based battle system.<br></p><p>While you can stun or defeat enemies this way as any class, the MP restoration works only for characters with the Mage archetype equipped, so make sure to go to Akademeia and speak to More (or use the Archetype Tree, if you have unlocked that in the main menu) to unlock the Mage class for everyone in your party, <strong>then make sure to Equip it on everyone</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-recommend-id="image://c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-recommend-id="image://c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By the time you’re running out of MP, you <em>should</em> have enough MAG (the Archetype Tree currency) to unlock the Mage class, unless you already spent it on other classes and abilities.

It doesn’t take long.</p><p>Since you can use the Magic Recovery ability two ways (by stunning or defeating in overworld combat), I’ll explain how each works.</p><h3 id="h7914"><a id=""></a><strong>Method 1</strong></h3><p>Stunning can be done relatively easily when enemies are near your level. You can attack enemies several times in the overworld (even slightly tougher enemies), and if you deplete the yellow gauge that appears when engaged in combat, they will be stunned.</p><p>Stunning enemies in this way is sufficient to regain MP for everyone in your party who has the Mage archetype equipped, and if you decide to battle the enemy while stunned, they’ll begin the fight already at half health.

<p>The mystery of who co-developer Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership has been solved. It has been uncovered that Acquire worked on the development of the game alongside Nintendo.</p>



<p>“Nintendo and Acquire are the authors of this software for the purposes of copyright,” a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1848377416328323547/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">copyright notice</a> on the game reads. It’s also been revealed that the game was developed in Unreal Engine 5 after copies of the game <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1848186451261002223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">were spotted in the wild.</a></p>







<p>If the name Acquire sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the same studio that worked with Square Enix on Octopath Traveler. The studio also worked on franchises like Way of the Samurai and Tenchu.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that neither Nintendo nor Acquire have confirmed the information. With the game set to release for Nintendo Switch on November 7, confirmation seems to be only a matter of time.</p>



<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is the sixth main game in the Mario &amp; Luigi series. Not only is it the debut of the series on the Nintendo Switch, but it’s the first main release since 2015’s Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam.  It’s also the first to not be developed by AlphaDream. The former developer went bankrupt and subsequently shut down in 2019.</p>



<p>What do you think of Acquire being the studio that helped develop Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership? Let us know in below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1056/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 and online multiplayer go hand in hand, and it should keep the player base occupied for another year. However, each Call of Duty title tends to change the rest of the content, so let’s see if a Campaign or Zombies appear.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: World at War was a game-changer as it introduced the popular Zombies game mode as a fun add-on to the usual Campaign and multiplayer offerings. Since then, we’ve enjoyed playing Spec Ops, Survival, Dead Ops, DMZ, MWZ, and other fun variations on the CoD formula.</p>



<p>Content is chopped and changed with every new entry—leading many to wonder what Treyarch has opted for in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 release</a>. We have the answers for you, so read below for full details.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-a-campaign">Does Black Ops 6 Have a Campaign?</h2>

<p><strong>Black Ops 6 does include a Campaign,</strong> and it’s set to be a multi-hour affair featuring Treyarch’s creative take on history. Whereas Modern Warfare stories are typically grounded affairs exploring military warfare, Black Ops narratives aren’t afraid to go off the deep end.</p>



<p>Black Ops Cold War explores brainwashing and mental manipulation and gives you two different endings to choose from. Whereas 2010’s Black Ops famously features Mason learning about the “numbers.”</p>



<p>Plenty of returning faces are seen in Black Ops 6—as you can see in the image above—and the Gulf War is the story’s focus this time.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-zombies">Does Black Ops 6 Have Zombies?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Braaains. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thankfully, <strong>Black Ops 6 features Zombies in its classic form</strong> with proper round-based Zombies and multiple maps already penciled in.</p>



<p>It’s been a strange few years for Zombies fans. After some amazing maps and the introduction of Outbreak in Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard featured the most barebones Zombies experience ever (and didn’t get much better), and Modern Warfare 3 went down the extraction shooter route with Zombies—which was fun but left me craving authentic Zombies.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 looks to be a return to peak Zombies. Terminus and Liberty Falls are two round-based maps set for launch, with a third map already in the works and set to arrive before the end of 2024. BLOPS 6 Zombies includes Wonder Weapons, Perks, and the usual array of gimmicks and Easter Eggs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/clash-of-the-space-titans-star-citizen-delayed-elite-dangerous-on-track/">planned May 2014 release</a> of that module was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/star-citizens-arena-commander-dogfighting-hits-1-0-release-milestone/">eventually delayed until December</a>. At the time, we noted that "a full release of the Star Citizen MMORPG [would be] expected near the end of 2016," a date that now seems as naive as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/star-citizen-production-schedule-release/">original 2015 launch window for <em>Squadron 42</em></a>.</p>
<h2>“We will build the game you are dreaming about”</h2>
<p>Back in 2014, Roberts Space Industries had raised a mere $67 million from crowdfunders eager to see Roberts' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/star-citizens-chris-roberts-discusses-upping-the-ante-on-pc-gaming/">lofty vision for a new era of space simulation games</a>. Now, that funding has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">climbed past a staggering $731 million</a> from players buying <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/a-complete-star-citizens-ship-collection-now-costs-48000/">pricey virtual ships</a> in a game that still exists only as an unpolished alpha <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/star-citizen-faces-major-server-outage-still-isnt-close-to-launch/">plagued</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/star-citizen-still-hasnt-launched-but-its-already-banning-cheaters/">significant gameplay issues</a>.</p>
<p>Roberts <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">said in a March update</a> that the team had "spent significant time looking at what <em>Star Citizen</em> 1.0 means and what it would take to get there." For now, though, the team "is hard at work, heads down, driving toward the finish line" for <em>Squadron 42</em>, as highlighted by <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/progress-tracker/teams">the game's public progress tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The extremely lengthy development path for <em>Star Citizen</em> and <em>Squadron 42</em> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/star-citizen-dev-offers-roadmap-for-development-of-new-development-roadmap/">become something of a joke</a> in the 12 years since it first became a crowdfunding darling. But it's not like we weren't warned. In 2012, Roberts Space Industries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121128182541/https://robertsspaceindustries.com/the-pledge">offered a public pledge</a> that the use of crowdfunding meant the developer would "focus on quality free of the pressure to deliver by a certain financial quarter." The team also warned that "there may be delays and there may be changes; we recognize that such things are inevitable and would be lying to you if we claimed otherwise."</p>
<p>"You’ve done your part, and we will now do our utmost to live up to your expectations," the team wrote in that now 12-year-old pledge. "We will build you the game you are dreaming about."</p>
