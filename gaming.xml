Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

            <p>
You know, you'd think that with decades worth of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> in existence, side quests would have been more or less figured out by now. And yet, there are still enough games releasing that seem more interested in going for quantity over quality. But for the devs over at Archetype Entertainment, the goal is to make the side quests in their upcoming sci-fi jaunt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus-2027">Exodus</a> not feel just "tacked on."
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/mass-effect-veterans-dont-want-side-quests-to-feel-tacked-on-to-their-new-sci-fi-rpg-and-they-cant-add-everything-or-the-game-would-be-thousands-of-hours/">GamesRadar</a>, former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> writer and current Exodus narrative director Drew Karpyshyn explained that side quests are more about "trying to give players the chance to explore what they want to explore, that will add to the main story." He continued, "We definitely don't want you to feel like you're doing it because you're obligated, like 'I need those three points to get my next level on this skill, so I guess I'll do it'. We want side quests to be something you would do even if you weren't getting a reward - you're going to get rewards, of course, it's a game, but we want you to feel like 'This is something I'm interested in, this is something I want to explore.'"
</p>
<p>
Karpyshyn noted that in turn, Exodus' side quests are tied into its themes and companions you may have. "It's tied into interesting aspects of our game that maybe don't get explored as much on the critical path, but you can see them," he explains. For Karpyshyn it's that age old tricky thing of deciding where is best for the team's focus, as they know they can't add whatever they want without the risk of the game becoming "thousands of hours [long], which sounds great in theory, but isn't realistic."
</p>
<p>
Personally, a game that's thousands of hours long sounds like a nightmare to me, so, I'm happy to see some amount of restraint being enacted here. As it currently stands, though, it'll be a while before we find out if Archetype succeed in making good side quests, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exodus-devs-want-you-to-know-that-despite-matthew-mcconaugheys-ai-deal-not-a-drop-has-been-used-in-their-game-so-far">as it's not due out until some time in 2027</a>.

            <guid>1428982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="43db56fcd8b83"><a title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43db56fcd8b83/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Daedalic Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're fans of the final frontier around these parts, so when our combadges chirruped with news of a Star Trek game for Nintendo's newest console, our anticipation grew like a clutch of tribbles in a grain silo.</p>
<p>As you'll have gathered from the title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Universe</a> is set in the TNG-DS9-VOY era and sees you charged with Captain Janeway's mission of getting her crew home safely after being thrown across the other side of the galaxy by an alien force.</p>
<p>If you've caught the show in the 30+ years since it debuted, you'll know that the Delta quadrant is fraught with hazards of all shapes and sizes — cube-shaped and otherwise — but German dev gameXcite is letting you make different decisions on your journey, exploring what-if scenarios that diverge from canon and really put you in the Captain's chair.</p>
<p>We caught up with Game Director <strong>Daniel Bernard</strong> via email to get confirmation on a couple of points and find out a little more ahead of the demo hitting the eShop on Monday and the game's launch in a couple of weeks...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You said in your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-beams-onto-switch-2-next-month">combat-focused dev video</a> that you took inspiration from Starfleet Command, Bridge Commander, and Legacy. Beyond Star Trek, what other games did you have in mind when designing Across the Unknown? (Aside: I love FTL and <em>still</em> hold out hope of a Switch port!)</strong></p>
<p>While we benchmarked all kinds of space games — from FTL to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/everspace_2">Everspace 2</a> — we wanted the combat to be as close as possible to what is seen in the show; how it would feel like to be the captain of a Starfleet cruiser, not a fighter jet.</p>
<p>Gene Roddenberry envisioned Captain Kirk as a "space-age Captain Horatio Hornblower," a decisive leader on long voyages, drawing from C.S. Forester's novels about a British naval captain during the Napoleonic Wars. As the Voyager captain, Captain Janeway carries on this tradition.</p>
<p>Naval warfare tactics influence space battles and make them more authentic. Even cloaked vessels are analogues to submerged vessels like German U-boats from WWII and submarines from naval battles that are difficult to detect. We wanted our game to be in this tradition.</p>
<figure data-uuid="cda93774dc500"><a title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cda93774dc500/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Daedalic Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How long have you been working on the game, and when did the Switch 2 version enter the conversation?</strong></p>
<p>We started with the first concepts in summer of 2022, but it took us quite some time to secure the Star Trek license and a publisher. We also first produced a prototype to test some ideas and align everyone on the vision. Full production finally began in September of 2023.</p>
<p>Because the handheld format is ideal for our gameplay style, we wanted to do a Switch 2 version as soon as the console was announced, but of course it took some time to get dev kits. Porting finally started in the fall of 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Voyager seems well-suited to a roguelike structure, with a clear goal/journey and lots of decisions Janeway was forced to make along the way. I imagine several fan-favourite topics jumped out (Tuvix, Kim's non-promotion, warp 10 lizard babies!), but could you talk about some perhaps less obvious elements of the show that you've integrated?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we should clarify that the game is not a true roguelike. While we started out with this concept, we quickly learned that due to the strong narrative and simple length of the show (and the journey within), that structure was not a great fit. Instead of quick “runs” where you constantly fail and restart, you are playing a 15-hour campaign to bring Voyager home.</p>
<p>To keep subsequent playthroughs interesting, not only can you make very different ship builds — leaning into research and resource production or offensive and defensive capabilities — but also narrative choices that lead to interesting 'What if' scenarios and new ways to solve questlines.</p>
<p>For example, you may offer amnesty to Seska, adding a capable hero, but potentially lose Chakotay out of protest. Or you may find a way to reprogram the Dreadnought that B’Elanna originally used against the Cardassians to become an ally. Lastly, what would happen if you found a cloaking device for Voyager?</p>
<p><strong>From the outside, Across the Unknown seems a PC-first experience. What's been the biggest design challenge adapting it for consoles, and specifically for Switch 2? Mouse mode feels like a natural fit, but the other consoles don't have that.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, the biggest challenge are the controls - that the game works well with a gamepad. But there are also many people who play PC games with a gamepad from their couch or on handheld devices such as the Steam Deck or ROG Ally. For this reason we have designed the UI/UX from the beginning to work well with both mouse and gamepad.</p>

<p><strong>On average, how long might a successful trip home to the Alpha Quadrant take? Are multiple 'runs' part of the gameplay loop, or are we looking at a longer journey?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the amount of side missions and exploration a player does, the first trip takes between 15 and 20 hours. As explained above, multiple runs are not part of the game loop, but with branching narrative and different options to build out Voyager, there is plenty of incentive to replay the game.</p>
<p><strong>Was there anything you considered including that was 'off-limits' for whatever reason (beyond the scope of the project/direction from the licence holder/etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign follows the events of the series and tells the story of established characters, so while we are giving the player meaningful choices, we took great care that nothing would feel out of place. As a Starfleet ship, you are not outright raiding other species, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Related, are there any characters or elements from the wider franchise in the game, or is this strictly Voyager-only? With so many shows and timelines/universes, the possibilities feel endless (and daunting?).</strong></p>
<p>While we have the rights for all 'Next Generation'-era shows, we are so far concentrating on characters and events from the Voyager TV show - this is also the most logical choice since Voyager is so far away from other Federation ships.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4dd0e6475cf2d"><a title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4dd0e6475cf2d/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Daedalic Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On your Steam page you say that "partial voice over as well as updated music and sound effects" will come in the final version - can you elaborate on that? Will lines and music from the show be in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown will feature fully voiced logs by Tuvok and Tom Paris at the start of each sector. It was important to us to bring back the original actors in a way that felt meaningful. These logs recap recent events and set the stage for the mission ahead. The characters are voiced by their original actors, Tim Russ and Robert Duncan McNeill.</p>
<p>Finally, we are also including the main theme from the show for the full release of the game!</p>
<p><strong>In terms of art, do you get access to materials and archival docs from CBS for art assets, or does that all come from personal research?</strong></p>
<p>Both. While our licensor provides us with certain assets from their archives, remember that Voyager is a fairly old show, so most things — such as ship models — are not available in the formats we would need and thus are re-created based on our research.</p>

<p><strong>Trekkies are a notoriously detail-oriented bunch and quick to offer, erm, 'feedback'. How does the team cope with the weight of expectation from players who can be very hard to please?</strong></p>
<p>We were quite nervous before releasing the first trailers and then the demo, but luckily the majority of feedback has been very positive. <em>[Note. The demo was released earlier on other platforms.]</em> Most players realise that we are an indie team but absolutely love the IP - because we are fans ourselves!</p>
<p>For that reason we were very thankful for the feedback and able to correct many small mistakes or lore inconsistencies - which was exactly the reason why we have put out the demo during development!</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we've got to ask: If you're in Janeway's shoes, do you separate Tuvix or not?</strong></p>
<p>I absolutely would. But as a player, we are allowing you to ask, “What if not…?”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s A16 iPad has never really gotten the love it deserves. With brand-new Air and Minis also being released in 2025, along with killer competitor models from Samsung and even the Kindle Scribe, the A16 (aka 11th Gen) iPad might have gotten short shrift in the praise department. But that’s just creating a great buying opportunity, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">the 11-inch A16 iPad is marked down by $50 right now at Amazon, down to just $300</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the wide gulf between the price point of the A16 iPad compared to the elite-level tablets from Apple and its competitors, this $300 Amazon deal is a major score, because the performance and features gulf is nowhere near as large. Many of the features of the higher-priced tablets also exist in the A16 iPad, and at a literal fraction of the price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Goldilocks Tablet</h2>
<p>The A16 iPad sits in the perfect spot between elite-level features and great price. It easily outperforms other accessibly priced tablets, working smoothly and reliably for games, streaming, and everyday productivity chores like email and browsing. And it does it without the hefty price tag of the top-tier tables which may deliver more of a laptop-like performance, but at a laptop-level price. Not too expensive, not too chintzy with the features — it’s just right.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an iPad if it didn’t have that super-primo display. It’s an 11-inch Liquid Retina with 2360×1640 resolution and True Tone tech that detects the ambient lighting and automatically adjusts the color temperature. It not only looks incredible, but it’s easier on your eyes. Pair that screen with the Wi-Fi 6 connection and excellent camera setup (12MP in both front and back), and the A16 iPad is a great tablet for FaceTime calls and video conferencing. Apple’s new Center Stage tech also keeps you centered in the frame, automatically adjusting the view as you move.</p>



<h2>Expansion Options Galore</h2>
<p>Another smart tablet-buying tactic: Take some of the money you’re saving by opting for the A16 iPad and invest in an Apple Pencil (1st Gen or USB-C; not the Apple Pencil Pro) and Magic Keyboard Folio and transform the tablet into a mini-laptop and premium note-taking device. All the tools for creative work are already built into the A16 iPad; adding the Apple Pencil is a great way to complete the package.</p>
<p>I like to call the A16 iPad the unsung hero of the iPad family. It checks off so many boxes while keeping the price tag exceptionally accessible despite often flying under the radar. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s current $300 price is a jackpot for anyone looking for a super-steady tablet.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/874914/cairn-review-pc-playstation-5</link>
            <guid>1428934</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m an awful rock climber. Being scared of heights probably doesn’t help. But when I’ve tried it, I’ve loved the slow, methodical work of moving from one ledge to the next. It reminds me a lot of why I love running; in both sports, you achieve goals that seem insurmountable by taking them one step at a time. <em>Cairn</em>, a new game from The Game Bakers, is one of the few games I’ve played that truly captures that feeling.</p><p>You play as Aava, a famous climber obsessed with summiting a mountain called Kami. You climb by moving all four of Aava’s limbs, one by one, to find safe cracks, bumps, and ledges to let you inch your way higher, all while managing tools and resources carried in your backpack. Climbing games are becoming something of a trend, but <em>Cairn</em> is different from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRAMoaEp-08"><em>Jusant</em></a>, where you just control the character’s hands, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783549/baby-steps-review-ps5-steam"><em>Baby Steps</em></a>, a sillier game where you just control the character’s feet.</p><p>It’s been a decade since my short-lived membership at a rock-climbing gym, but <em>Cairn</em>’s mechanics brought back all sorts of memories of my time scaling the walls, especially the importance of good footwork. Based on my amateur experience, it’s a great rock-climbing simulator. By setting spikes into the walls, you can make spots where your rope will catch you if you slip off the mountain face. A robot companion picks up the spikes when you reach safety so you can use them again. By using chalk, you get a temporary boost to your grip. With food and drink, you’ll help keep yourself fed, hydrated, and warm.</p><p>Progress can be grueling. I was almost always on edge as I methodically searched for the next place to put Aava’s hand or foot. Slipping comes at a cost; you’ll fall to your last spike or to the ground, and depending on how far down those are, it could mean another long climb, hitting yourself against the wall, or, in the worst case, death. Rain, wind, snow, and ice make things even more difficult.</p><p>But it’s also peaceful, in a way. I was incredibly focused while playing, and more than once, I caught myself holding my Steam Deck right up to my nose as I hunted for the next step of my climb. I was often completely in the zone. As I journeyed, I even started to internalize Aava’s quest as my own. When she quipped about a good grip, I would be elated that I had a brief moment of safety. When she was precariously close to falling, her breath would speed up in panic, and my stress levels would spike, too. When she would fall, she often shouted in frustration, usually mirroring how I felt about the situation.</p><p>Aava will meet other people during her journey and hear from people who care for her, and they provide companionship during what’s largely a solo quest. But sometimes, she’s also rude to them or will alienate and ignore those who care for her. Aava even takes out her anger on her robot buddy. Still, I could relate. Like Aava, I also just wanted to climb the damn mountain, and usually, I didn’t want anything to get in my way.</p><p>I am predisposed to like <em>Cairn</em>: I love long runs, and to me, there are fewer things more satisfying than the feeling of overcoming a seemingly insurmountable obstacle one step at a time. I’ve fallen out of running lately, and I’ve missed it. <em>Cairn</em> reminded me what’s possible when you focus just on the next thing in front of you — and of the complex feelings that come with persevering through the quest.</p><p><sup>Cairn<em> is available now for PC and PS5.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874914/cairn-review-pc-playstation-5]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1428907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article contains some </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Baldur’s Gate 3. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-tv-series-set-for-hbo-will-be-a-continuation-of-baldurs-gate-3s-story">HBO is turning Baldur’s Gate into a TV show</a>. On its own, that’s quite an exciting proposition: a big-budget, live-action series set in Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ most iconic city? Yes please. But the project’s announcement, which came courtesy of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, contains a line that immediately had me burying my head in my hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Baldur’s Gate TV series will be a continuation to the games,” says the report, “telling a story that takes place immediately after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3, as the characters — old and new — are dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third game.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ramifications of what events, exactly? The defeat of the Netherbrain? Or perhaps the enslavement of it in the name of the Absolute? Or Gale’s choice to turn into a magical nuclear bomb, sacrificing himself to save the city? These are just three of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/baldurs-gate-3/All_Endings">the many ways Baldur’s Gate 3 can end</a>, and that’s before we consider the dozens and dozens of choices that you make on the way to that conclusion. There are approximately 17,000 variations of the game’s final cutscene. How could a TV show possibly “deal with the ramifications of the events of the third game” when every single player has their own version of events? </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/minthara-1770402606565.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">For some players, Minthara is an enemy. To others, she's a lover and a close ally.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer, of course, is that showrunner Craig Mazin must decide what choices are “canon.” One half of the duo behind The Last of Us’ HBO adaptation must now set certain events in stone in order to create a baseline to build his story upon. But to decide upon a canon series of events for Baldur’s Gate 3 is not the same as, for instance, determining which of Mass Effect 3’s trio of concluding options would be the starting point for what comes next. It’s not a simple case of how the story ends, but everything that happened on the 100-hour journey up until that point, too.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The entire picture of Baldur’s Gate 3, the story any one player lived, is the result of hundreds of decisions, ranging from the tactical to the emotional to the completely unaware. For some, Minsc and his miniature space hamster, Boo, are vital parts of the story. Yet many won’t even know who he is, having passed by and never recruited him to their party. There are those for whom Shadowheart’s escape from the Church of Shar is a defining moment, yet others will have found an equally defining pathway in encouraging her to embrace the dark goddess. And for those players of a more chaotic leaning, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the tale of an unstoppable serial killer that greedily succumbs to their own Dark Urge, tearing limbs off wizards and letting goblins slaughter refugees. The game is less a single story with a handful of different outcomes, and more like hundreds of character threads that are entwined like rope. A rope that grows thicker and longer with every romance (steady now), argument, betrayal, and surprise you experience. To unravel all that and find a single golden thread for television seems at best foolhardy, at worst impossible. </p><p>Anyone who wants a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 wants a follow-up to their own experience, not Craig Mazin’s.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say that the show is guaranteed to be bad, or of poor quality. Considering Mazin’s prior work – in particular, Chernobyl – and HBO’s track record with fantasy programming, there’s every chance that Baldur’s Gate will be a fantastic show, at least when viewed in isolation. But it’s difficult to create that isolation when the project is explicitly a continuation of the journey so many of us undertook for hundreds, sometimes even thousands of hours. And because of Baldur's Gate 3's unrivalled branching RPG design, we have all become deeply attached to our own versions of this world and its characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be said that details of how the show will be structured are still incredibly thin. It will feature a group of new protagonists, so we don’t know to what extent the now-famous party of heroes and antiheroes that make up Baldur’s Gate 3 cast will feature. By being a “continuation to the games”, could it merely exist in a world where the Netherbrain once existed, and tales of heroes’ journeys to defeat it are muttered in the city's streets like mythical tales? Or will meetings with the likes of Wyll, Astarion, Lae'zel be little more than fleeting encounters, kept somewhat shapeless in an effort to remain relevant to most players’ memories of them? It creates a dilemma: purposefully keep things vague and potentially undercook the history of this world, or pick a defined canon that could alienate large portions of your viewership?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Television adaptations are, of course, designed with more than one eye on wider markets. HBO wants people who have never played Baldur’s Gate 3 to become invested in its world. But that begs the question: why a direct sequel? Why take place immediately after a story that a portion of your audience has no investment in? If half your audience has no attachment to those events, and the other half will almost certainly have experienced a different version of the events you’re building upon, who is winning here? Anyone who does want a sequel wants a follow-up to their own experience, not Craig Mazin’s. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate won’t be the first show to tackle this problem. Just this year, the second season of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout</a> told a story set after the events of Fallout: New Vegas, an RPG that also concludes with a number of very different, world-defining options. But Fallout has made a number of smart choices. Firstly, it’s not a sequel to the game; it’s just set in the same universe, and thus isn’t trying to continue the plot of New Vegas. Secondly, it’s set over a decade later, and purposefully leaves the events during that time a complete mystery. And so the show’s depiction of the game’s characters and factions doesn’t have to join the dots. Did you hand the Vegas Strip to the Legion in your playthrough? Well, in the 15 years since, they’ve succumbed to infighting and have fallen from their mighty position. You don’t need to know how it happened, it just did. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Using this method, Fallout (sort of) successfully ensures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunner-explains-whats-going-on-with-mr-house-ahead-of-season-2-finale-and-how-there-still-isnt-a-new-vegas-canon-ending">no one New Vegas ending is cemented as canon</a>. Every outcome could have happened, but the result of your choices may not have endured for the 15 years between the game and the show. Larian Studios, the developer of Baldur’s Gate 3, understood the benefit of this kind of time gap; its gargantuan RPG is set more than a century after the events of its predecessor, ensuring it’s not restricted by the conclusion of Baldur’s Gate 2 and has space to create its own story. By starting immediately after the events of BG3, the show won’t have this luxury. It <em>has </em>to make a choice. It <em>has </em>to invalidate thousands of playthroughs. It can’t be the sequel to <em>your </em>experience of Baldur’s Gate 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t have to be this way. The real lesson to learn from Fallout is that video game adaptations thrive best when they are decoupled from existing stories. So the big question is, why is this not just a Dungeons &amp; Dragons show? You can set a D&amp;D show in Baldur’s Gate. You can call a D&amp;D show “Baldur’s Gate”. You can even include characters and reference (certain) events from Baldur’s Gate 3. But to purposefully shackle yourself to continuing the story of that game, rather than freely exploring its world, feels like purposefully rolling a critical fail on the first round of combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hbos-baldurs-gate-show-wants-to-be-a-sequel-to-bg3-thats-impossible]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new clip uploaded on social media, Nadeshot unveiled the ‘signing’ of Chris Hemsworth to 100 Thieves, the esports organization he founded several years ago. It’s a promotional stunt to boost ‘Crime 101’, an all-new movie starring Hemsworth as the lead, supported by Halle Berry, Mark Ruffalo, and Barry Keoghan.</p>



<p>On February 10, a special one-shot livestream will take place <strong>between </strong>Nadeshot and Hemsworth, and a limited range of 101 Thieves x Crime 101 apparel will be available to buy directly from the ‘101 Thieves Compound’ in Los Angeles.</p>







<h2 id="h-chris-hemsworth-joins-100-thieves-for-now">Chris Hemsworth Joins 100 Thieves… For Now</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded on social media, Nadeshot pretended he was having a tough time playing ARC Raiders. He suggested that he needed to sign ‘someone new’ to the team, rather than relying on <strong>old talent</strong>. The promo featured Nadeshot pretending to <strong>scout </strong>Chris Hemsworth using clips from Crime 101, the new movie hitting theaters on February 13.</p>



<p>As the clip closed out, Nadeshot welcomed Hemsworth to 100 Thieves. Then, the camera jumped to Chris ‘You Know Him Best as Thor’ Hemsworth, who corrected the creator:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks Nadeshot, but I think you mean <strong>101 Thieves</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post said that Nadeshot would ‘run some games’ with Hemsworth, which could be interesting.</p>



<p>But does Chris Hemsworth play video games? In Avengers: Endgame, he’s enjoying some Fortnite with his friends, Korg and Miek, but does the iconic Australian actor enjoy a session or two away from the big screen?</p>



<p>Probably not. He has made some throwaway comments in the past and was recorded playing an old Thor game on Xbox 360 <strong>years ago</strong>, but that’s all we know. If he’s nursing a secret ARC Raiders addiction, then who knows? Perhaps he can teach Nadeshot a thing or two.</p>

It was actually Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop, which took issue with an image of a shoulder pad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-game-pulled-from-steam-after-what-may-be-a-nuisance-dmca-takedown-from-a-troll-claiming-to-be-games-workshop">IGN reported on Void War</a>, a strategy game dubbed ‘FTL in a Warhammer 40,000 skin,’ after it was pulled from Steam. At the time, its developer, Tundra Interactive, suggested it may have been on the receiving end of a nuisance DMCA takedown from a troll claiming to be Games Workshop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why. The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000. The voidships look like Imperial Navy Vessels. Some of the characters look like Space Marines. There’s an actual Psyker that’s called a Psyker. There are “Imperial Shrineworlds.” There’s even a mention of “Imperial astrogation authorities.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the takedown, IGN asked Tundra Interactive for comment, and it responded with something quite unusual. It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what made this one odd: the claiming information came from Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion, in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. At the time, it was thought that it was unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds. But, well, it turns out Games Workshop really was behind the takedown, according to Tundra Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tundra Interactive told IGN that Games Workshop eventually replied to the developer to confirm it was their notice, and that the concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the Steam store page that it said could give the impression that Void War was associated with Games Workshop. The company specified that the element in question was “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.” And, well, yeah, that Void War trailer did indeed have an image of a character who looked a lot like a Space Marine, complete with "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/cover-art-1769428932329.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This isn't a Space Marine, it's a character from Void War. Or, was.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tundra Interactive told IGN that it disagreed with Games Workshop's assessment here, but in order to get Void War back on Steam and to avoid a drawn out DMCA fight, it pulled the trailer. It may re-upload it in the future after making an adjustment, but its priority is getting back to work on Void War, the developer insisted. And, to that end, Void War is now back on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive’s statement in full to IGN:</p><blockquote>To recap, the initial takedown was triggered by a DMCA notice attributed to Games Workshop. At the time, we could not independently verify the submitter beyond the name and contact email Valve included. The contact email was GW's public infringements inbox, and the name listed was “Mal Reynolds,” which is also a fictional character from the sci-fi TV show Firefly.</blockquote><blockquote>After over a week of no response, Games Workshop eventually replied to our email and confirmed the notice was theirs. They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</blockquote><blockquote>All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists. While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations.</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for your patience, and thank you for the overwhelming support. o7 commanders.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All’s well that ends well? Perhaps. Certainly this case shows that Games Workshop and “Mal Reynolds,” who I’d love to meet one day, are keeping a close eye on video game characters and their shoulder pads. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise, given Games Workshop's history of stringent IP protection. Be warned! The Inquisition is always watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

		<p>The Six Nations is back, having kicked off on Thursday with a thorough drubbing of Ireland by France. Has that set the narrative for this year’s competition?

<p>In our MIO: Memories In Orbit review, I said, <em>“MIO: Memories In Orbit is an early contender for one of the most memorable games of 2026. It is an incredibly challenging game to play, with combat being a highlight, even if some platforming section can be frustrating. It looks fantastic, though, and the story is well told. MIO: Memories In Orbit draws you in, and does not let go easily. It is hard game but the journey is worth experiencing.”</em></p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I find myself in a rare position of being <em>between games</em> at the moment, so I've actually started to fill in one of my biggest blind spots that's haunted my backlog for years: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>. I know, I know, I really should have played this one already, but I haven't, alright! I'm putting things right now, I promise.</p>
<p>I'm only an hour or two in at this point, and it's... weird. I like it, but it's definitely weird. Stay tuned for more revelations.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Drama intensifies as I cleared <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> up to chapter 14. Not sure I will be able to finish it this weekend, but if not, it will very likely be the fault of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> demos. Shadow dropping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a> (and <strong>Ganbare Goemon! Collection</strong> on the Japanese eShop!) was unexpected and something I will certainly make some time to revisit. Smooth progress continues on the story mode of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a>, but it will have to share its wheel with the shiny and chrome new release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/carmageddon-rogue-shift">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Too many games for only 48 hours, send help!</p><p>

My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>. I admit to not having completed the game back in the PlayStation era (too many great games coming out every single week!), but I really enjoyed the demo. Adulting truly is the greatest nemesis of JRPGs, and looking at the release schedule ahead, 2026 will indeed be the year of JRPGs on both Switches!</p></div>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>More <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> for me. I've recently learned the DIY recipe for Glowing Stickers and can use them to make cool custom patterns for my walls which don't have to be stuck on a square canvas. Which means the various features of my Trek-themed house can now look infinitely more impressive!</p>
<p>Trouble is, I now need to find a reliable supply of that weird green moss to craft the bloody things before I can customise. Lots of trips to faraway islands with Kapp'n this weekend, then. Wish me luck, folks.</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>It’ll be no surprise what I’ll be playing this week. My copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on the 3DS arrived this week so I’ve been making it a prework/morning routine of checking on my weirdos. (Yes I made Alex!) I’m really enjoying it so far and it’s perfect to get me ready for when the new one comes out. Outside of that, I have plenty more games on my backlog to finish so I’ll likely play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> this weekend and finally try out the most recent DLC. I’m not far from completing the game but I can’t help but get distracted by fishing for hours and avoiding the creatures as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>PIKMIN! I’m playing lots of Pikmin at the moment. I purchased two Game Vouchers before Nintendo killed the service, and since I finally discovered the Pikmin series last year, I thought it was about time I checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve beaten Pikmin 3 already, though I’ll be jumping back in this weekend and starting it on a higher difficulty – I honestly had no idea how short it is, but it’s still a banger. Pikmin 4, meanwhile, is just on another level. It’s wonderful, and I absolutely love the new camera angle. There’s a lot of chit-chat at the beginning, but I feel like I’ve gotten through the worst of it now. This might be cropping up quite a bit in future WAYP features…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week sees another new batch of <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar </em>releases riding upon winds of ethereal magic, with Battletomes for the Disciples of Tzeentch and the Lumineth Realm Lords, as well as new models, hitting pre-order. Games Workshop sent us a sampling from each army to check out, so follow along as I jump in on my <em>Warhammer AOS</em> new release review!</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Lumineth Realm-Lords - New Battletome</strong></h2><p>The new Battletome for the Lumineth Realm-Lords brings this army into the modern era of <em>Warhammer AOS</em>, with updated lore, faction rules, and Warscrolls, along with Spearhead, Path to Glory, and Army of Renown rules. I won’t cover everything here, but I’ll highlight a few key points that stood out to me.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-lumineth.jpg?itok=D2UYnYDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="667">

  </picture><p>Lore-wise, this book does a wonderful job of setting the scene for the Lumineth, with over 30 pages dedicated to the history of the Lumineth (as is to be expected with these Battletomes).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s not a lot of time spent in the present, with the Vermindoom gnawing through the fabric of reality, but what little is there teases out the trouble the perfection-seeking Lumineth find themselves in.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As we jump into the rules, the first thing we see is the Lumineth’s Depict Rune battle trait. Once per round, you choose a rune to inscribe on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p><p>These runes give small bonuses like adding 1 to the run and charge roles of select units, or subtracting 1 from hit rolls by enemy units. But where it gets immediately interesting is how these combo with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>While only one rune is active at a time, these runes gain conditional bonuses if you’ve used <em>other</em> specific runes so far in the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Also known for their spellcasting, the Lumineth boast some spicy spells, with most of them handing out mortal wounds like pieces of Lembas bread (sorry, mixing mythologies here).</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Lumineth Realm Lords - New Model</strong></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-lumineth-realm-lords.jpg?itok=_66QMvLR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>Along with the new Battletome, we also got to check out the new model releasing for the army, the Vasari Lord Regent.</p><p>With two optional builds, this Lumineth stands tall and proud no matter how you choose to assemble him. His stats are as follows: Move 6”, Save 4+, Control 2, Health 5. And his weapon, the Regent’s Sword has the <strong>Crit (Mortal)</strong> keyword, Attack 5, Hit 3+, Wound 4+, Rend 1, and Damage 2. Not too shabby, but his abilities really stand out.</p><p>His passive ability, <strong>Shining Example</strong>, states that each time a friendly Lumineth Realm-Lords unit wholly within 12” of him uses the ‘Rally’ command, you can make 3 additional rally rolls of D6. Imagine scoring even one extra six off this ability, the impact would be huge.</p><p>He also has the situational but impressive <strong>Wall of Blades</strong> ability (though, I suppose it’s not situational if you build around it) which allows you to pick a friendly Vanari Auralan Wardens unit wholly within 12” of him and select them to be the Wall of Blades, then choose an enemy unit in combat with the Wall to be the target. You roll a die for each model in combat with the target enemy unit, and on a 5+ you inflict 1 mortal damage on the target.</p><p>I love the flavor of this, here’s this regal, imperious general who can sweep into the battlefield, rally his troops not with screams and shouts but his own glittering, inspiring presence, then with a word turn a unit in the heat of battle into a slicing, precise wall of death. So fun and flavorful!</p><p>Now, if you’ve had just about enough of all this orderly Lumineth business, let’s get weird…</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples of Tzeentch Battletome</strong><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-battletome.jpg?itok=0etMvLgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="706">

  </picture></h2><p>If you had to pick one army in all of <em>Warhammer</em> <em>AOS</em> to serve as the complete opposite of the Lumineth Realm-Lords, I don’t think you could do much better than the Disciples of Tzeentch. Bathed in the&nbsp; kaleidoscopic colors of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of change, the Disciples thrive on unrest and scheming, hoping to serve their god to bring about a great crystalline freakout.</p><p>As with the Lumineth Battletome, the Tzeentch Battletome is full of incredible lore - and I would argue paints an even better picture of the army, their beliefs, and how this varied group comes together for a greater (impossible to comprehend) purpose. There’s even a section of the Jade Obelisk, a <em>very</em> cool-looking Chaos <em>Warcry</em> army.</p><p>Shifting over to the rules, we see a bevy of Battle Traits the army starts with. These include <strong>Eldritch Illusions</strong>, allowing you to set up three units in reserve during deployment, <strong>Smoke And Mirrors</strong>, which allows you to swap a unit for one of your units in reserve, and <strong>Silver Simulacrum</strong>, which lets you set up a second Argent Shard during deployment (vs. when you’d normally be able to, during faction terrain setup).</p><p>There’s also <strong>All Part of the Plan</strong>, which lets you gain Fate points whenever (to put it simply) certain things go <em>wrong</em> for your army, <strong>Destined to Serve</strong>, <strong>Destined Arcana</strong>, and <strong>Destined for Battle</strong> which let you spend said Fate points to remove damage, boost casting rolls, and add to your charge rolls, respectively.</p><p>This creates an incredibly malleable and, what I would call, “slippery” army that’s hard for your opponent to wrap their arms around (just as Tzeentch intended).</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples of Tzeentch New Models</strong><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-of-tzeentch-fatemaster.jpg?itok=eYyd0_TK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></h2><p>Now let’s close out this review with a quick look at some of the new models coming up for preorder today. First up is the Fatemaster.</p><p>This military mastermind comes out swinging with the following stats: Move 5”, Save 4+, Control 2, Health 6. His weapon, the Cursewrought Glaive, sports Attack 4, Hit 3+, Wound 4+, Rend 2, Damage 2. Which is fine for a single model unit, but his abilities are what really make him shine.</p><p>First, there’s <strong>Long in the Planning</strong>, a once per turn Activation during the Enemy Hero Phase that let’s you spend 2 fate points to simply remove a friendly unit with 12” from the battlefield if an enemy unit charges them and gets within 3”. Again… slippery!</p><p>Then there’s the <strong>Bound Retinue</strong> ability, which you can trigger once per turn on your movement phase. This one’s so interesting, and could be a real doozy! If it is masked by illusion (i.e. set up in reserve, as described above), you can pick it <em>and another unit </em>masked by illusion, and set them both up just about anywhere on the battlefield (the only restriction being they need to be more than 9” from an enemy unit). What!?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-of-tzeentch-argent-shards.jpg?itok=B8DG0SFr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>Finally, we have the new faction terrain Argent Shards. I love the look of these bizarre shards of crystal and eyeballs, and their abilities aren’t too shabby either. There’s the <strong>Magical Focus</strong> ability, which allows a shard to act as a magical foci, meaning your spell casters can use its position instead of the position of the spell caster for measuring and determining line of sight on their spells.</p><p>The Shards also have the <strong>Magical Duplication</strong> special ability, which says once per turn during any movement phase you can either set up an additional Argent Shard (if only one is on the battlefield), or remove it from the battlefield and set it up again in another spot on the battlefield. Talk about keeping your enemies on their toes!</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples and Lumineth - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><br>To wrap it all up, I think these are two strong releases for <em>Warhammer AOS</em>, though I do have to admit I’m more drawn to the Disciples. Maybe it’s just the flavor of raging chaos vs. stately order, but I feel like the lore, new rules, and new models for Tzeentch are just stronger than the Lumineth.</p><p>Are you going to be updating your Lumineth or Tzeentch armies with these new releases? Are you excited about the new models?

            <title><![CDATA[IEM Krakow Semifinals Represent a Clash of Titans in the Tauron Arena]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iem-krakow-semifinals-titans-tauron/</link>
            <guid>1428859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The stage is officially set for the penultimate stage at IEM Krakow this weekend. We’re about to see the final four teams battle for the lion’s share of the prize pool in Poland, welcoming scores of visitors to the Tauron Arena in Krakow, as many as <strong>22,000</strong>.</p>



<p>MOUZ enters the weekend riving an immense wave of momentum after totally dismantling G2, Team Vitality steps into the ring after a solid group stage, Team Spirit has batted down all comers, and FURIA has spent the last few weeks doing what FURIA does best, securing a clean high-tier finish.</p>



<p>But what are the most accurate IEM Krakow predictions looking like?</p>







<h2 id="h-which-team-will-win-at-iem-krakow">Which Team Will Win at IEM Krakow?</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of Counter-Strike betting, you’ve almost certainly got a wager fluttering around on the outcome of IEM Krakow. If you’ve waited this long, hopefully you can get your slip in today, but if you’ve had a stake running this whole time, hopefully you’re still in play.</p>



<p>There’s a dense weekend of entertainment lined up at IEM Krakow. Here’s what the schedule looks like:</p>



<p><strong>February 7</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit v. FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality v. MOUZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February 8</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TBC v. TBC (third-place match)</li>



<li>TBC v. TBC (grand final)</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a whopping $400,000 prize on the line for the first-place team in Krakow, but at this point, every organization walks away with a sizeable chunk of cash in their pocket.</p>



<p>The four teams left represent a real test. MOUZ has come into the semifinals with some stellar momentum after tearing through G2, but the team has to contend with Vitality, an inherently challenging prospect. In 2025, Vitality scooped <strong>nine </strong>trophies across the Counter-Strike space, and it’s going to be a tough hill for MOUZ to climb.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got FURIA v. Team Spirit, and that promises a different kind of battle. FURIA just wiped Aurora from the running with a monstrous performance (shout out KSCERATO), but Team Spirit has shown a resilient streak to get this far.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Vitality remains the statistical favorite, but MOUZ could serve up a slight underdog edge to snatch the trophy. The safe money will be on Vitality, but there are only four teams to choose from at this point, so it’s not a huge pool if you’re making a Counter-Strike wager.</p>







<p>Which team do you think has the IEM Krakow trophy in the bag? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Star Addresses Whether The TV Show is ‘Fallout 5’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-star-addresses-tv-show-fallout-5/</link>
            <guid>1428856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Fallout television series, backed by Amazon’s Prime Video, is one of the most beloved live-action adaptations ever made. It’s an award-winning show that boasts an original story fused with elements pulled straight from the post-apocalyptic game franchise, and it just wrapped its second season and is moving onto the third with immense gusto.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the series’s most iconic stars addressed a fan theory. He recognizes that people are curious whether the Fallout TV show ‘is’ or perhaps is setting up for <strong>Fallout 5</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-fallout-tv-show-leading-to-fallout-5">Is The Fallout TV Show Leading to Fallout 5?</h2>



<p>We could have <strong>ten years </strong>of the Fallout TV show, including the two that we’ve already had. There’s an abundance of world-building for the showrunners to pull from, and production on the third season is already underway.</p>



<p>In December, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">made a bold statement</a> about <strong>both </strong>the future of the television show and Fallout 5, showing how they’ll intertwine:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a recent supersized interview breakdown with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartIII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Walton Goggins, who plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard in the television show, echoed that sentiment, saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In some ways, people have said, “Is it Fallout 5?” That’s way above my paygrade.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear what he’s referring to, but it’s <strong>most likely </strong>a nod to those who believe that the television show’s original content, which is set further in the future than anything ever created in the Fallout universe, is building up to Fallout 5’s story.</p>



<p>That original production was also addressed by Goggins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They did their homework, and it was built into the DNA of the story that they created, and this isn’t like Fallout 1, Fallout 2, or Fallout 3… it’s its own thing. It’s original content within the Fallout world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Whatever happens, it could be at least another four or five years before we see <strong>anything </strong>to do with Fallout 5. Bethesda still needs to wrap development on Starfield’s second expansion (and whatever comes next), <strong>and </strong>deliver The Elder Scrolls 6. There’s a lengthy wait in store, but fans might be able to tide themselves over with upcoming releases like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bend Studio’s Cancelled Live Service Shooter Surfaces Online Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-cancelled-shooter-surfaces-online/</link>
            <guid>1428850</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bend Studio was forced to shut down the ongoing development of an unannounced live-service shooter last year amid restructuring and layoffs that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-lays-off-around-30-of-staff-following-live-service-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the company</a> disappearing. The game that was cancelled would have been a third-person, military-themed shooter, but we know little more than that about the abandoned title.</p>



<p>Recently, fresh files surfaced online from the project, taken from a former Bend Studio animator responsible for designing turrets, character gait, and some minor animations, such as throwing knives and deploying drones.</p>







<h2 id="h-mirror-pond-animations-appear-online">‘Mirror Pond’ Animations Appear Online</h2>



<p>It’s not a huge leap into uncovering Mirror Pond, which was the project name for Bend Studio’s cancelled third-person shooter, but it’s <strong>something</strong>. In the files pulled from a former animator’s portfolio, we can see a third-person perspective (which we already knew about) explored from a more technical standpoint.</p>



<p>What’s assumed to be a player character model walks across the screen, brandishing long firearms and traipsing with a traditional military movement pattern. In another clip, we see the same character throwing what looks like knives, before shooting something from a forearm-mounted device, and deploying a small drone mounted on their back.</p>



<p>There’s also a shot of a turret activating and firing at an unseen target.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>These files were uncovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bend-studio-cancelled-live-service-title-mirror-pond-animations-surfaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M</a>P1st, but no source was given.</p>



<p>It all points to Mirror Pond having been planned as a near-future third-person shooter of sorts, perhaps aligning with the bygone days of Syphon Filter. That’s one of the franchises that allowed Bend Studio to cut its teeth in the gaming world, and it featured spycraft, a third-person perspective, and techy gadgets.</p>



<p>In September 2025, Bend Studio opened up and started hiring again for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-hiring-for-a-new-multiplayer-game/">new, unannounced multiplayer title</a>. What that is remains to be seen, but it could be an attempt to recover the fragments of the cancelled live-service ‘Mirror Pond’.</p>



<p>Fans have long hoped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">a new Days Gone project</a> would surface, but as we all know, that’s very unlikely.</p>







<p>What do you think Mirror Pond would have looked like? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Pokémon is celebrating 30 years this year, and as part of this, trainers around the globe can expect all sorts of exciting (and surprising) announcements.</p>
<p>Ahead of the annual event Pokémon Day, taking place later this month on 27th February 2026, Stern Pinball has announced it will be stepping into the battle arena with its very own themed pinball cabinet. And yes, we're referring to an <em>actual</em> pinball cabinet here (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_pinball">not a video game</a>).</p>
<p>The price of admission? Well, according to the <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">official landing page</a>, it'll be <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">available in three varieties</a> and is "coming soon". The Pro model starts at <strong>$6,999</strong>, the premium model is <strong>$9,699</strong> and the "highly collectible Limited Edition model" is going for <strong>$12,999</strong>. This particular model is also <strong>limited to 750 units</strong> "globally".</p>

<p>If you want <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">future updates about this cabinet</a> and when exactly it drops, you can sign up for email updates on the official website. And if you're ready to purchase or happen to be a business owner (or just want to enquire about one), you can also fill out a form for that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the prices for this Pokémon cabinet are in line with the current offerings on Stern's website, which include cabinets based on series such as Star Wars, X-Men, and Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics had to say</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="d245c705831a7"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d245c705831a7/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's an action-packed week on the Nintendo front, and on top of the Partner Direct, we also shared a bunch of previews earlier this week.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our preview for Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park we're not so sure about it so far. Here's what staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the £16.99 / $19.99 Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196663 @ 1770485930 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say? Here's the round up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/03/amusing-attractions-in-an-attractive-amusement-park">Game Informer</a>: "Meetup in Bellabel Park is about what I expected based on the trailers, and that's a good thing. I had a great time in Attraction Central, and knowing there are so many more stages in each minigame has me looking forward to playing the full release with some family on my couch."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-dlc-meetup-bellabel-park-preview/">Polygon</a>: "<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, <em>Jamboree TV</em>, and <em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> all serve similar purposes: They show what kind of play is possible with Switch 2 and leave you excited to see what Nintendo can do in a full Mario Party or WarioWare game. The novelty factor that currently makes add-ons like this fun to toy around with is bound to wear off before the console’s one-year anniversary. If mouse controls are going to be more than a bonus gimmick, we’re going to need some more substantial games that make use of the feature soon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-meetup-in-bellabel-park/">DualShockers</a>: "If you have a friend group you can line up to play together with on a game night, or perhaps some gamer kiddos on hand in your household, Super Mario Bros. Wonder for the Switch 2 is absolutely going to be a winner that you can break out time and time again."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">IGN</a>: "Each game certainly had some fun to offer, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like this concept is awkwardly straddling the line: if I wanted multiplayer mayhem with Mario characters, there are so many other, better options like Mario Kart, Party, or 3D World, just to name a few. And, if I wanted 2D Mario, I’d much rather play the traditional Super Mario Bros. Wonder campaign, which I adore. To be completely fair, there is more traditional content on the way in Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition in the form of Wonder Effect boss fights against the returning Koopalings and extra challenges that take place in pre-existing levels, but I didn’t get to try any of that at this preview event. Even so, none of this Edition’s additions currently feel as exciting as a couple of extra brand-new worlds likely would have."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-wonder-turns-into-mario-party-with-the-bellabel-park-expansion/1100-6537843/">GameSpot</a>: "None of these minigames would be worth the price of admission on their own, but altogether, the package looks to be substantial. We only got a taste of a handful of the minigames during our multiplayer session, and each one we tried had multiple difficulty levels with different stages to try. I also got the sense that there was more to be discovered, possibly through the collection of those special coins that were so tricky to get during the cooperative stages."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57278-hands-on-with-switch-2-s-early-2026-lineup-mario-tennis-fever-meetup-in-bellabel">GoNintendo</a>: "Your interest in this add-on will likely be dependent on how often you’re able to get a group of friends together to play. If you’ve got a core gaming group, and you’re the type who likes a silly collection of multiplayer games in the vein of Nintendo Land or Mario Party, Bellabel Park should fit the bill."</p>

<p>It's available at select Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart Stores in the US. And in Canada, you can take to the court at Best Buy and Walmart.</p>
<p>Nintendo's in-store Switch 2 kiosks have also offered demos for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Unfortunately, there's no mention of this latest first-party demo being made available on the eShop (<em>at least yet</em>), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although we didn't share a full preview of this title, Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds recently went hands on with the new entry, and thinks Mario Tennis fans will be "absolutely thrilled" with the new title. We've also done a previews round up if you would like to find out more about this new game.</p>

<p>In some related news, earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would be <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/serve-up-fun-mario-tennis-fever-feb-12-nintendo-san-francisco/">hosting special launch events</a> for Mario Tennis Fever at its stores in New York and San Francisco. These events will feature the game demo, photo ops, a gift alongside the purchase of the title and more.</p>

<p>Here's what's on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a41c3ac65d5b9"><a title="Console Archives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a41c3ac65d5b9/console-archives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hamster Corporation</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's Partner Direct was loaded with all sorts of surprises, and one of the biggest announcements for retro fans was Hamster Corporation's reveal of its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives series</a> for Switch 2 (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/the-arcade-only-rave-racer-drifts-onto-ps5-this-month-console-archives-also-coming-soon">and PlayStation 5</a>).</p>
<p>This will revive classic games, originally released on home consoles, on modern hardware. Two titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> are already available on the Switch 2 eShop, so what else is on the way?</p>
<p>Hamster has now provided details about what else is on the way in its <a href="https://youtu.be/eaIlTJyYR30">latest Japanese broadcast</a>. It features many of the games showcased in the initial announcement. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-doraemon">Doraemon</a> by Hudson has been dated for July, but the rest of these games don't have a release date just yet.</p>
<p>For now, here's what's on the way in the near future (via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong> (Tecmo 8-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Cool Boarders</strong> (UEP Systems, 32-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Doraemon</strong> (Hudson, 8-bit) – <strong>30th July 2026</strong><br>
- <strong>Nobunaga’s Ambition</strong> (KOEI, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>MagMax</strong> (Nichibutsu, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>Sonic Wings Special</strong> (Video System, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Dezaemon Plus</strong> (Atena, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</strong> (Nippon Ichi Software, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia</strong> (Toshiba-EMI, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Monster Rancher Hop A Bout</strong> (Tecmo, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>UFO: A day in the life</strong> (ASCII, 32-bit)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the Arcade Archives series, Hamster's Console Archives series is "packed with convenient features". This includes customisable button layouts and screen settings, as well as the ability to save and load at any point.</p>
<p>Apart from its reveal of Console Archives, Hamster also announced it would be adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> to its Arcade Archives collection on 26th February 2026.</p>

<p>The demo went live on Switch 2 this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has finally released its demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2 and some side-by-side comparisons to the other versions of the game have now been shared online.</p>
<p>If you are wondering this version holds up, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/64-XoEHbp-o">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, the Switch 2 will run at a lower resolution than the Xbox Series S version, but upscaling is supposedly better on Nintendo's console. This is also said to apply to the Switch 2's filtering and shadow quality, which shows "better results".</p>
<p>As for the game's frame rate, all consoles target 60fps, but the Switch 2 release apparently struggles to maintain this frame rate during more heated moments.</p>

<p>Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">recently previewed Pragmata</a> and had the following things to say about the game's performance and resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you tried out the Pragmata demo on the Switch 2 yet? What are your thoughts so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <guid>1428775</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ftl-like-void-war-dmcad-allegedly-by-games-workshop-0" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0fe5dc8-146f-4c11-b6a8-2b5f2365e5bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">two weeks ago when we reported </a>that <em>Void War</em> had been DMCA'd by a party claiming to be Games Workshop. Now, we can confirm that it was indeed Games Workshop that filed the <em>Void War</em> DMCA as Tundra Interactive has told us more about this story, and how <em>Void War</em> is back up on Steam now.</p><p>After failing to communicate with Tundra Interactive for a week, Games Workshop finally replied, and confirmed that the <em>Void War</em> DMCA was on their behalf. That means that Games Workshop does employ a lawyer named Mal Reynolds, despite how unlikely that seemed, and it is a deeply ironic name given the <em>Firefly</em> character with the same name. Tundra Interactive explains what issue Games Workshop had with <em>Void War</em>:</p><blockquote><p>They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</p></blockquote><p>Tundra Interactive emphasizes that all the artwork in the trailer for <em>Void War</em> was original work created by their artists. Despite that, in the goal of a fast resolution, they have removed the story trailer that had the offending image. With that done, they were able to get the game back up on Steam. Tundra Interactive stated, "We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations." saying that new versions of the trailer may come.</p><p>It is possible to view the trailer via a <a href="https://video.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257147370/movie_max.mp4" rel="nofollow">link from SteamDB</a> which has an image at 34 seconds which match the description given by Games Workshop, as well as confirmed by Tundra Interactive that it is the offending image.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Games Workshop has a history of being... very protective of its IP, dating back to actions like trying to trademark the term <a href="https://gizmodo.com/games-workshop-is-still-claiming-to-own-the-trademark-t-5982201" rel="nofollow">Space Marine</a>, to the contentious relationship with fans over things like fan animations that they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games-workshop-is-trying-to-shut-down-fan-animations/" rel="nofollow">took steps to ban</a>.</p><p>We previously reached out to Games Workshop, but they did not reply regarding whether they had filed the DMCA against Tundra Interactive.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, all's well that ends well and Tundra Interactive can get back to making their game without further legal hurdles. <em>Void War </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/" rel="nofollow">available on Steam </a>and also <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">on Itch.Io</a>, which will also provide a Steam key.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
