            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be coming out before the holiday season this year, following the game's appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-showcase-2025-round-up-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the official Silksong Discord, Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon wrote: "I confirmed BEFORE holiday - we are not tied to a console release." This indicates that Silksong's release is not tied to that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox's new Xbox ROG Ally handheld</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the confusion is due to the game's sudden appearance at the tail-end of the Xbox ROG Ally reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase. Xbox's Sarah Bond stated that people will be able to play Silksong on this new handheld, leading some to interpret the two sharing a release date.

<p>The gaggle of people who have been fiending for anything and everything Silksong related have been desperate for anything concrete about the game and its release. Prior to the event-heavy weekend, interest was piqued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-ignites-perfectly-reasonable-shadow-drop-hopes">due to an update to the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, the game was confirmed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date">playable at an Australian museum this September</a>. Earlier still, Nintendo included the game in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Nintendo Direct and locked in the game's presence on both the Switch 1 and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>There was also the cake fiasco, in which the eagle-eyed Silksong lovers went all in on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">cake recipe as the core of a release date tease</a>, a theory Team Chery had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">come out and put to rest</a>. With last night's news, those down bad for the smallest crumb of Silksong info may be able to rest, at last.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the concrete confirmation last night has folks very excited. A peak at the Silksong Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/">provides a window into the joys of happy gamers far and wide</a>. However the scars of hopium still ache in the hearts of some battle-hardened Silksong-minded folks. One user, Breadbowl004 wrote in response to Griffon's post: "Notice how he didn't say Holiday 2025".</p>
<p>That being said, it's still unknown when <em>exactly</em> the game will be released. Also consider this, it would be incredibly funny if the game was pushed back to 2026. Something to think on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Game Freak has made games other than Pokémon before. It has also released games on non-Nintendo platforms before. Yet whenever it spices up a launch schedule with either of these curveballs, it never fails to catch us off guard.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Pokémon dev popped up at the Xbox Games Showcase to reveal <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/beast_of_reincarnation">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, the action RPG previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/pokemon-studio-game-freak-is-partnering-with-private-division-on-project-bloom">revealed back in 2023</a> under the codename 'Project Bloom'. It looks awesome, it's arriving at some point in 2026, and Switch / Switch 2... don't appear to be invited to the party right now.</p>
<p>Beast of Reincarnation has been confirmed for launch on Xbox Series X and S, PC and PS5, and, from the little we've seen so far, it certainly seems to be making the most of the beefier consoles' power.</p>
<p>Described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat," Beast of Reincarnation will see you exploring a post-apocalyptic Japan, on a mission to take down a gruesome beastie that brought about mankind's demise. Soooo, <em>not</em> catching cute little bug creatures in the tall grass, then?</p>
<p>Here's a brief summary and a handful of screenshots from the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion.<br>
Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.<br>
Explore what it means to be human in Beast of Reincarnation, an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat.<br>
What awaits at journey’s end?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one was initially announced as a partnership between Game Freak and Private Division, but the latest reveal has a new studio, 'Fictions,' on publishing duties — presumed to be the team built by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/ex-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-pick-up-private-division-portfolio-under-new-studio">former Annapurna Interactive staff</a>.</p>
<p>It all looks very big and impressive, with a scale that we're sure would prove too much for Switch 1. Switch 2, on the other hand, might be able to handle things — it can handle <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, for crying out loud — but it's still missing from the launch line-up for the time being. Keep those fingers crossed for another announcement soon then, eh?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the long-in-development endless cat breeding game from devs Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, has just had its release pencilled in for February 10th, 2026, by a fresh trailer. Yes, it’s still looking very weird and nigh impossible to explain to a mate in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-trailer-for-the-binding-of-isaac-devs-next-game-mewgenics-answers-none-of-the-many-questions-i-have"> trailer it got in April</a>, this latest one roped in the most fitting collab <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">Binding of Isaac</a> developer McMillen and co could have landed, in the form of sinewy surrealism expert and YouTuber MeatCanyon. We’ve also gotten a nice overview of where the devs are at in assembling their weird feline with two heads.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, the release date trailer featured a cartoon bloke explaining a bit about his cat to a real bloke who I’m sure is a real vet. Among other things, the kitty’s got a gambling addiction, a conjoined twin, and has been probed by aliens in addition to having made a deal with the devil. So, just your average cat with average cat quirks.</p>
<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/686060/view/529848673510623712?l=english">Steam dev blog</a>, McMillen explained the decision to push back releasing the “turn based legacy roguelike draft sim” into the wild until next year, rather than chucking it out of the cat flap before the end of 2025.</p>
<p>“Dude, listen. Launching in Nov–Dec is hard,” he wrote, “We want this game to get the attention it deserves and don’t want to compete with holidays and holiday AAA releases. And honestly, adding a few more months to dev means launching with an even more heavily tested and polished experience!”</p>
<p>In addition to more general polishing and playtesting, the sorts of things the team says they’ll be focusing on in this extra time include the addition of custom events, more cutscenes, and making sure they can launch the game in a few different languages.</p>
<p>McMillen added that Mewgenics’ mysterious final boss - which I’ve got no doubt will be <strong>something</strong> - is on track to be finished by the end of this month. The game’s “big secret late-game system” is already ready to go, and it’ll start getting some “alt/shiny furniture” next week. Sit back down on your gleaming throne, I know you’re excited about that last part, but patience is key here.</p>
<p>Why does a turn-based RPG/roguelike thing about cats shagging needs sparkling sofas, you might wonder. Don't look at me, I've got no idea whatsoever, but Mewgenics has definitely captured my curiosity, even if it's just because it has cats in it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

State of Decay 3, for example, failed to turn up. The Perfect Dark reboot was conspicuous by its absence. But perhaps Starfield’s ongoing M.I.A. status hurts the most — at least for long-suffering fans of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> community had hoped Bethesda would announce something to do with the game at its Xbox Games Showcase, but while The Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 both getting their moment in the spotlight, Starfield skipped proceedings entirely. No DLC, no expansion, no PlayStation 5 release… nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the Starfield community is starting to lose hope and a good deal of faith in Bethesda, whose silence around the game has been deafening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had so much hope for today's Xbox show, but no,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6itk0/i_had_so_much_hope_for_todays_xbox_show_but_no/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said acatato on the Starfield subreddit</a>. “After so much time of silence (let's not talk about small update) the game looks so dead now, it's sad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What a complete disappointment,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6izi4/what_a_complete_disappointment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added totallynormalpersonz</a>. “What a joke the only thing we ever hear from Bethesda about this game nowadays is stuff off the Creation Club. The Xbox showcase would have been the perfect time to show off something new for this game. Unfortunately Bethesda doesn't seem to care. Wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda has abandoned this game and are hoping the community will make content for them. This does not bode well for future Bethesda game studio projects.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bethesda makes it so hard to defend this game,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6mzoe/bethesda_makes_it_so_hard_to_defend_this_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said TheVossDoss</a>. “I love Starfield. 1,100 hours in. If it weren’t for mods, I’d given up long ago. Knowing that Bethesda will never read this, I’m nonetheless speaking directly to you — shame on you for keeping your loyal fans in the dark, and for throwing in the towel. If you decided to give up on this game and move on, fine, but let us know so we’re not holding on to hope. I cannot believe Starfield was a complete no-show today. Thank you to all the modders out there who have kept the game on life support. I fear, though, we’re getting dangerously close to the heart monitor flatlining.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, fans just want some sort of communication from Bethesda on the future of the game. If it’s left it behind, they’d like to know. If the promised second expansion <em>is</em> coming, they’d like to know. If Starfield is coming to other platforms, they’d like to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comments from Starfield fans are now spilling over into social media posts from Bethesda Game Studios about unrelated matters. Take, for example, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1931788007071182958" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post about a Fallout 76 interview at Summer Game Fest</a>. The replies include questions about Starfield’s status, including “Why did you guys abandon starfield?”, “Have you guys abandoned Starfield?”, “I’m uninstalling Starfield…. I’m tired of waiting,” and “RIP Starfield.” You get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the growing disappointment are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6kyjw/a_reminder_to_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some within the community</a> who are pointing out that Bethesda may shadow-drop a Starfield expansion and a PS5 release. It enjoyed huge success with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which it shadow-dropped in April to the tune of over 4 million players. Perhaps this is the new way forward for Bethesda. And if that’s the case, then perhaps some sort of Starfield update could be around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, the Starfield community is left sifting through previous statements from Bethesda as they look for a glimmer of hope. Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wait to find out if all that still stands goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>The Persona-inspired horror game Demonschool has a new release window, following a delay last year.</p>
<p>As revealed at the PC Gaming Show, the RPG will be released this summer. It was originally intended to launch last September, but in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-and-italian-horror-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay">August was delayed to allow the studio to "manifest our bigger dreams into reality"</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer, below, provides a gameplay summary of Demonschool and its parallel social activities and tactical battles, all with a cartoon horror aesthetic.</p>

<p>Demonschool will be released across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (Steam, Epic), with Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>Set in a haunted university, Demonschool includes both Persona-esque social activities and romance, with tactical battles inspired by Into the Breach. There will be 15 playable characters, each with special combat skills.</p>
<p>"Our team took great pride in fleshing out the world of Demonschool as much as possible," said Brandon Sheffield, creative director of developer Necrosoft Games. "With plenty of class and demon assignments to complete, characters to hang out with, and minigames to play, students won't run out of things to do on Jabberwock Island."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">demo of the game was released last year</a>, which I described as "Persona meets Buffy" with its 90s vibes. "Added to the bold artwork, a dark yet funky soundtrack, and an over-the-top cartoonish aesthetic (I love the bouncy run animation), and Demonschool is yet another brilliant example of silly adults bested by a plucky gang of pesky kids."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The appearance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bernband">Bernband</a> during last night's PC Gaming Show had a few of us at RPS clicking our fingers and pointing at our monitors yelling: "Bernband! Bernband!" This remake of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-being-pleasantly-lost-bernband">best sci-fi walking sim of 2014</a> has been in the works for a while. Creator Tom van den Boogaart has dipped in and out of working on the alien wanderer, often switching focus to other projects such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a>. But now it looks like we are once again getting a trickle of sweet extraterrestrial wanderlust. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Bernband is a sci-fi exploration sim set in a bustling alien metropolis," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789170/Bernband/">the Steam page</a>. "Wander the streets at your leisure. See the sights, from dodgy dive bars to sprawling mega-marts. Discover secret areas, or hang out with the locals! There are no missions or timers; your only goal is to take a stroll."</p>
<p>That lack of goals and objectives puts it once again firmly into walking simulator turf, but if it shares even a bit of the atmospheric richness of the original walkabout, that is absolutely grand. When Bernband <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-alien-city-bernband">first appeared</a>, it offered a crowded little world of alien barflies, night clubs, high walkways, creepy alleys, xeno churches, school classrooms, and plenty of elevators connecting it all together. </p>
<p>It was a wonderful city to get lost in, and a reminder that simply dandering around a strange place can be exciting without having to collect anything, or even speak to anyone. As Alice O put it at the time, it's "about the freedom of being alone in a crowd, the joy of noise washing over you and filling you, and the pleasure of wandering with no purpose beyond wanting to have time to yourself and see some interesting things."</p>
<p>The original game's maker, Van den Boogaart, has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bernband-gifs">periodically shared some of his ongoing work</a> on the remake. But it would often submerge again for some time as he worked on other things. After all, the creator is a member of the busiest gang of Dutch game tinkerers in the world, the Sokpop Collective (who are also credited as helping on this remake). Sokpop are a a kind of romantic ideal of the games industry - a crowd-funded independant gang of mates who have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-releasing-their-100th-game-and-aiming-for-100-more">made over 100 games</a> after announcing their plan to release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-popping-out-a-new-game-every-2-weeks">a new plaything every two weeks</a>. Their many many works include village building card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stacklands-is-a-gentle-village-building-game-played-with-cards">Stacklands</a>, and tiny controller-friendly RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/king-pins-is-sokpops-teeny-tiny-take-on-age-of-empires">King Pins</a>.  </p>
<p>No release date for Nu-Bernband yet, but we will stay ever vigilant. Bernband. Bernband!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over the past few days, there have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombaClub/comments/1l5jikh/tomba_is_not_compatible_with_switch_2_right_now">a few notices posted online</a> regarding Limited Run games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_special_edition">Tomba! Special Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/clock_tower_rewind">Clock Tower: Rewind</a> which aren't currently running properly on Nintendo's slick new console (and both feature on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">Nintendo's lists of games with issues</a>). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/clocktower/comments/1l40f1i/any_idea_when_rewind_will_be_fixed_for_switch_2/">Clock Tower appears to have audio problems</a>, whilst Tomba is fairing a little worse.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a specific line of code has been causing the issues, according to Limited Run founder Josh Fairhurst. Our sister site, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>, reached out to Fairhurst, who has addressed the situation, saying that they had very little time with the console pre-release to deal with a troublesome bug:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zstxhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The backwards compatibility issue derives from a line of code that is used for video playback on the original Switch. We have reported the line of code to Nintendo and are hoping to see it addressed as an update to the Switch 2's backwards compatibility in the future, as I believe this line of code is also causing compatibility issues with games from other publishers.</p>
<p>We were accepted as Switch 2 publishers and developers in mid-May and received our development hardware two weeks ago. We started digging into the issue the minute we got our kits and found the line of code causing the problem after a few days of investigation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LRG published a statement <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1931576962679521441">on social media</a> over the weekend mentioning that the firm was hopeful of this being addressed in future updates from Nintendo. Of course, it is still very early days for Switch 2, so these little bumps in the road are to be expected, and it's at least good news for potential players of Limited Run's Carbon Engine-emulated games that the problem has been identified.</p>
<p>The Carbon Engine, if you're unfamiliar, is Limited Run's multi-platform development tool that helps different emulators interface with modern consoles. It uses emulation as a base, then builds features like UI, rendering, audio, data management, controller inputs, and console-specific features like achievements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Near the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_M3QwLBrg8g?si=gp3gx-tYiLO9bE5v&amp;t=5747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase 2025 stream</a>, and just before passing the baton to the Obsidian Direct dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-features-much-greater-reactivity-and-third-person-view-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and Grounded 2, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer made an appearance to comment on the first-party lineup that fans will get next year. He not only confirmed a new Forza game for 2026 but also seemed to tease something Halo-related. Here's the exact quote:</p>
<p><em>Looking ahead, next year marks 25 years of Xbox. It's a big milestone for the platform and franchises that you helped build and make popular. We couldn't have done this without everyone who's been with us on this journey. As we think about bringing a new generation of players to these iconic franchises, I'm excited to share that players will get to celebrate 25 years of Xbox with a new Fable, the next Forza, Gears of War: E-Day, and the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: E-Day</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a> were known quantities, of course. As for the new Forza game, we don't know yet for sure whether it is a new installment in the mainline simulation series developed by Turn 10 or a new Forza Horizon open world game. Logic would suggest the latter, as Forza Horizon 5 launched in 2021, whereas the latest Forza Motorsport was released in 2023.</p>
<p>Xbox fans are most excited about Spencer's final tease, though. Most of them think he's referring to a Halo game, since that was the flagship game when the original Xbox debuted in 2001. It could be a remaster or remake of the first game, Halo: Combat Evolved. Of course, there's also a chance it's something else entirely. Another option could be the return of Project Gotham Racing, which was the other major Xbox exclusive when Microsoft's first console debuted on the market. At the same time, it's unlikely Spencer would be boasting so much about another racing game when already announced that a new Forza is arriving in 2026.</p>
<p>We may know more before the end of the year. Meanwhile, we'll make sure to report on any rumors or leaks on the subject.</p>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is finally leaving early access with a full 1.0 release set for August.</p>
<p>A fresh trailer for the game was shown at the PC Gaming Show over the weekend, showing plenty of its 2D roguelike gameplay, parkour abilities, and stylish combat.</p>
<p>Published by Ubisoft, The Rogue Prince of Persia is being developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire. It released into early access last May.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">received a huge update back in November</a>, revamping the art style and doubling the game's size.</p>
<p>The full version will finish the story, add extra biomes with a proper final boss, and include more enemies and weapons. The developer has also promised news of an exact release date as well as console releases on the way.</p>
<p>It's heavily inspired by Dead Cells too, as you'd expect from the same studio.</p>
<p>"What it definitely gets from Dead Cells is an enviable forward momentum," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">Christian Donlan for Eurogamer last year</a>. "The Prince is all leanness and athleticism, decked out like a modern Olympian but with a bright red sash that flows out behind him and highlights his swiftness, his elegance."</p>
<p>Evil Empire is a subsidiary of original Dead Cells developer Motion Twin, which was spun off to work on updates and DLC. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">ended support for Dead Cells last year</a> to work on a "secret project", which turned out to be The Rogue Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>Motion Twin, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/motion-twins-windblown-releases-in-early-access-even-sooner-than-you-think">its own game in early access: Windblown</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 And All Its Accessories Unboxing</p>
      </div>
<p>It's surprising that the issue wasn't addressed by launch, and given Nintendo's family-friendly reputation, we wouldn't be shocked if a future update limits or eliminates the ability to make the Switch 2 transcribe those words.</p><p>Nintendo has already disclosed that it reserves the right to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-may-record-your-audio-and-video-chats/1100-6531383/" data-ref-id="1100-6531383">"collect, monitor, and record"</a> audio and video chats conducted through Switch 2. The company later clarified that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-clarifies-how-and-why-switch-2-could-collect-monitor-and-record-your-gamechats/1100-6531419/" data-ref-id="1100-6531419">it will only review those recordings if the chats are reported</a> for violating community guidelines. Nintendo has also disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-camera-nintendo-responds-to-safety-and-spying-concerns/1100-6530594/" data-ref-id="1100-6530594">several safety measures to prevent children</a> from being preyed upon by older GameChat users. For example, players younger than 16 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat-will-require-phone-number-for-security-purposes/1100-6531774/" data-ref-id="1100-6531774">need a parent or guardian's permission to use GameChat</a>, and a phone number is required for all users to sign up for it.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch mobile app was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-mobile-app-updated-with-gamechat-and-other-switch-2-features/1100-6531907/" data-ref-id="1100-6531907">updated with GameChat and other Switch 2 features</a>. The app now allows players to invite friends to GameChat, view each others' play history, and add new friends via friend code or a QR code. It also let's players see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">the Switch 2 games</a> in their play history.</p><p>GameChat is free for now, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/" data-ref-id="1100-6530684">it will become a paid feature</a> on April 1, 2026.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Korean developer EVR Studio unveiled MUDANG: Two Hearts, an intriguing Metal Gear Solid-like game with a key premise: what if North and South Korea reunited as a single country? And what if, on the day the bill was supposed to be signed, a terrorist group attacked the South Korean National Assembly?</p>
<p>In MUDANG, players control two protagonists from contrasting backgrounds: Ji Jeongtae, an elite North Korean special forces operative fighting through enemy lines to uncover the truth; and GAVI, a K-pop idol under constant surveillance who plays a pivotal role in exposing a dangerous conspiracy. These opposing perspectives provide different gameplay experiences and narrative arcs that ultimately converge on a single, disturbing truth.</p>
<p>The game supports open-ended level design, allowing players a high degree of freedom when it comes to choosing their path throughout the missions. No matter what approach you take, the game offers a wealth of options, such as environmental takedowns; a wide range of close-quarters combat (CQC) moves, both lethal and non-lethal; a robust toolkit of gadgets, such as goggles, EMPs, grenades, lures, and mines; and a deep arsenal of firearms.</p>
<p><iframe title="MUDANG: Two Hearts | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6-5vM_tSVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EVR Studio also claims that the enemy AI will be particularly challenging. It was designed to be versatile, dynamically adapting to the player's actions in real time. When the player character is hidden, the enemy forms search parties to investigate suspicious signs, such as fallen allies, disabled lights, or nearby footsteps, and raises the alarm when something is amiss. During combat, they work together to flank and outmaneuver the player.</p>
<p>MUDANG: Two Hearts will also feature seamless, immersive cutscenes, a narrative that responds to the player's choices, and formidable bosses that will test the player's combat skills to the limit. The game will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>Typically, the big reason the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series always appealed to me a bit more than its sister franchise <em>Harvest Moon, </em>was because of the more fantasy-focused setting. While&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>always presented a pretty chill and down-to-earth Japanese farm fantasy, the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series always leaned a bit more Western and high-fantasy in its style. I’ve come to associate that setting with the series, which made the initial reveal of <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>and its traditional Japanese twist on the setting make me feel a bit conflicted. Despite a vibe shift and new setting, though, this game is an incredible new take on the <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series that shines just as bright as my favourite entries.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/incsbQ-ygJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While I wasn’t immediately sold on the shift in setting for <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, something that I was immediately excited about was the approach to character design and romance options in the latest entry of the series. Like any life-sim farming game, dating the hot guys and girls in your town is a staple of the genre. The <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>games, though, typically have you playing as a protagonist with a pretty young look. Most of your eligible romance options end up being just as young or younger, while the adult characters with equally exciting personalities and designs often stay on the sidelines. Nearly every character in this game, including your romance options, have more adult design or personality, and as someone who grew up playing the series, it’s nice to see the newest entry age along with me and focus on romance options that feel a bit more geared toward me.</p>


<p>Bonding with your favourite hunk or hottie happens pretty regularly in between the smorgasbord of other activities you’ll engage in throughout the game, from action RPG battles to crop caretaking and settlement building. There’s a bit of a tighter narrative pushing along the events of <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> compared to past games, and having every character directly involved in those story beats makes your eventual courtship all the more exciting. I was even blown away by a surprising quality-of-life feature introduced in this game that ties into the romance options – Rewoven Fates.</p>


<p>This feature lets you hop into alternate timelines that are fully standalone parallels to your main game, letting you experience the full romance route of any other characters without having to do an entire new playthrough of the game. It helps retain the importance of who you end up picking in your main playthrough, while easing some of the FOMO of missing out on the stories and dialogue from options unexplored.</p>
<p>One of the other major new features in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>is that settlement building loop I mentioned earlier. As you progress through the story, helping gods reawaken and a small village rebuild, you’ll eventually be able to recruit NPCs to tend to your gardens and crops automatically while you go off battling bosses and running errands for townsfolk. It’s a really fun feature that helps put a more obvious sense of progression on the farm-life aspect of the game, which is usually a bit more self-driven in these games. It also helps make the game world feel so much more naturally alive – my biggest gripe with the previous <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>game was that your town felt more like a bunch of standalone buildings lazily plopped into an open map than it felt like an actual lived-in village. As your settlement grows in this game, though, it does such an amazing job of adding life to the world in a way no other entry in the series has.</p>

<p>While combat isn’t necessarily the main focus of the game, it thankfully feels better than ever before. You’ve got a wide variety of weapon types to use, each with their own unique movesets and styles. Different enemies have certain weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but you can typically approach battles in whatever style you prefer and make it through just fine. Plus, bringing your favourite characters into battle with you adds another fun avenue to interact with them and feel immersed in the blooming friendships and romances as the calendar ticks by.</p>
<p>I ended up absolutely loving everything about <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma,&nbsp;</em>even the parts of it I was initially put off by in its announcement. The world and your town feel so alive, and it has some of my favourite characters from across the entire franchise. It reinvigorates the <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>formula on every level, feeling like the proper evolution and upgrade this franchise has needed.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Polish developer Bloober Team (Silent Hill 2 Remake, Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear 2, The Medium, Observer) announced a release window for Cronos: The New Dawn. The new sci-fi IP will debut at some point in the upcoming Fall season on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/concept/10011556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p7tflq7ctxn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is already available on all platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, alongside the news, Bloober also presented a new Cronos: The New Dawn trailer, offering a closer look at the terrifying Orphans and revealing intense survival moments inside their nest. The Orphans are twisted monstrosities born from humanity's darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior (they are exceptionally aggressive and relentless), which turns every encounter with them into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent the Orphans from merging. In Cronos: The New Dawn, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. Otherwise, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy.</p>
<p>The new trailer also recounts part of the story of a mysterious predecessor, a traveller ND 3500,&nbsp; and their cryptic travel log. In this game, players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the Polish district of Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p>

<p>Previously, Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the game's combat was inspired by survival horror classics such as Resident Evil and Dead Space. The developers have also been loosely <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by FromSoftware's Dark Souls to make a more challenging game. When it comes to the setting, they were influenced by other media, like the movies 12 Monkeys and The Thing and the TV series Dark.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. The official PC system requirements have already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> and don't seem too onerous on paper.</p>

The handheld is weighty and ergonomically satisfying, but my favorite discovery is that players can launch Steam games natively from the Xbox dashboard.</p><p>The game library, which players may access at any time by pressing its dedicated button on the handheld, features all your titles regardless of which platform you own them on. A discrete label beneath the game’s title denotes which storefronts they belong to. Furthermore, you can quickly access third-party storefronts like Steam and Epic Games Store by pressing the Ally’s Xbox button, which launches the Windows Game Bar, and selecting the desired application just beneath your recently played games.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our new aggregated library lets you quickly access all of your games. Because this is Windows, you can launch and play natively, both your games from Xbox as well as other leading PC storefronts," Roanne Sones, head of Xbox devices, says. "You can also stream your console games through cloud gaming or remote play. So what this means is that your library, including hundreds of Game Pass games and all of your installed games from third-party storefronts, is all in one place for you, ready to play on your Xbox Ally through remote play gaming or natively on the device."&nbsp;</p><p>Many questions remain, including whether Microsoft tracks data to unlock Xbox achievements while playing a game from another storefront like Steam or Epic Games Store. We’ve reached out to an Xbox representative for comment.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Learn to cook. Meet your neighbors, become entangled in their lives, give them gifts and learn their stories.</p><p><strong>Fireside Menace</strong></p><p>Long ago, the world changed. The <a title="Games > Covenant [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/covenant">Covenant</a> of the Hearth decreed that the day belonged to humanity, but the night… the night belonged to other things. Now, all earthly lights save hearthfires go out when the sun sets, and the Mara ride the night-winds. Don’t go out after dark—the night is not for you.</p><p>For now. (After all, what self-respecting sorcerer follows the rules?)</p><p><strong>Human, Humble Magic</strong></p><p>Magic in Mandrake isn’t about flashy fireballs and shimmering shields, but about folkloric ingenuity, whimsy and patience. Grow a cherry tree from seedling to maturity in seven days rather than seven years, then fashion your sorcerer’s staff from its wood. Befriend a river. Eavesdrop on the dead. Spend a haunted night at the Butcher’s Oak. Drink tea with the god who lives in your chimney.</p><p><strong>A Host of Lavishly-Realized Characters</strong></p><p>Welcome to the village of Chandley. It’s small, it’s complicated, and everyone’s got their own story.</p><p>Meet Rosen—bee-keeper, candlemaker, rook-speaker—the even-handed village leader charged with steering this troublesome community of eccentrics. Or Gideon, the somber hunter who makes pacts with the wild powers of the woods.</p><p>Befriend Nessa, the village smith, whose kindness conceals the scars of an old tragedy; and Thackery, the effusive Voicer, who keeps technology that no-one—least of all he—fully understands.</p><p>Visit the lighthouse, where Jory and Ruan Vicory live with young Tamsyn: the girl they saved from the sea, and who still hears voices calling to her from beneath the waves…</p><p>Chandley may be small, but it’s old, thick with secrets, and set in its ways. Is it ready for the return of a Mandrake?</p><p><strong>Beyond the Firelight</strong></p><p>Encounter the spirits, gods and bogles that live alongside the people of Chandley: the smiling revenant imprisoned in a tree, who claims he knows you (even though he’s hundreds of years dead). Lonely, long-armed Granny Jakes in her hidden orchard, who offers you a sip of a drink that the world has forgotten how to make. The Regent of the Woods, bearer of a white crown. The shy thing that whistles an old tune in the depths of a mine no-one has worked in decades. Hroame, who is sometimes stone and sometimes not.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Cataclysmic events have wrought havoc on the natural order, and the very world will change as time goes on revealing new opportunities for exploration and conquest to the bold and daring. Establish expansive cities to spread your influence and strengthen your economy, raise armies and command troops in turn-based tactical battles to overcome your enemies by force, and push forth into the unknown to uncover the dark secrets that lie at the planet’s core.</p><p><strong>Lead Disparate Factions</strong></p><p>Whether you command righteous warriors descended from the stars or hive-minded aliens that know only how to fight, feed, and propagate, <em>ENDLESS Legend II</em> features vastly different factions each driven by their own philosophies, histories, capabilities, and narratives. Each of the factions have unique traits that set them apart from one another whether on the battlefield, in matters of commerce, with regards to empire-building, or in diplomatic affairs—it is up to you to adapt to their strengths and weaknesses and build strategies and distinct playstyles.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>The choice of faction will influence every aspect of the game. Will you prefer to benefit from a constant state of fighting, untethered by the need to justify your wars, spawning additional warriors with each victorious battle to grow endlessly in strength? Or will you choose to benefit from cohabitation and cooperation, spreading tendrils of influence throughout the world to build a network of allies, leveraging relationships with the minor factions of the planet to further enrich your empire? Learn what makes each faction distinct and use it to your advantage whether you’re leading them, or looking to destroy them.</li><li>Military doctrine varies greatly between the factions, providing unique opportunities for a capable commander to gain an advantage over their foe, even when out of combat. Whether you’re building massive fortifications as the Kin of Sheredyn to defend your cities, establishing connections to powerful weapons and support systems waiting in orbit, or you’re investing in the spread of coral that allows the units of spiritualist Aspects to support themselves outside of friendly territory, know your enemy and know yourself to gain the upper hand in any conflict.</li><li>Either auto-resolve combat or take direct control of individual units within your armies when battle begins, using the surrounding terrain to your advantage as you seek out chokepoints, cover, and the high ground. Apart from having faction-specific units, traits, weapons, and attributes, each faction also features special battlefield abilities that can turn the tide of battle if properly utilized. Where one faction might work best with a patient commander, able to meticulously maneuver troops to secure powerful adjacency bonuses, another might rely on force of numbers and overwhelming strength.</li><li>Recruit heroes and watch them grow over time as they gain new traits to bolster their abilities, build relationships that provide them with various boons, and acquire equipment useful both in and out of battle. Powerful commanders, properly trained and armed, can turn the tide of entire wars when wisely utilized.</li></ul><p><strong>Reign in an Evolving World</strong></p><p>Empires will rise and fall based on their ability to adapt to a changing world. Starting from a single humble city, expand according to your faction’s unique strengths and limitations while adapting to the periodic monsoons and tidefalls. Build districts around your cities’ central structures, exploit strategic and luxury resources littered around the world, and develop your technological capabilities and industrial might.</p><ul><li>Cataclysmic tidefalls will expose new opportunities and threats as the oceans recede to unveil new land ripe for expansion. While your existing territory will remain unscathed, the newly revealed terrain from the retreating oceans will open up new avenues of approach for you and your enemies, alongside new resources to exploit and new anomalies to explore. While this can fundamentally change the strategic value of various locations as time goes on, a wise leader will plan for the inevitable—will you prepare to expand into new lands as soon as a tidefall occurs, or focus on shoring up your defenses where you anticipate new landbridges to appear?</li><li>Plan the development of your cities to focus on population growth, industrialization, and commerce, or prioritize their contribution to the sciences, your empire’s influence, and your military might— the choice is yours based on the needs of your burgeoning empire. Establish districts that provide fortifications or further the production of various resources, take advantage of adjacency and terrain bonuses, and pursue technological advancements that allow you to upgrade established districts or unlock entirely new options. Will you patiently seek out ideal locations to establish long-term economic hubs and military strongholds, or will you spread rapidly to secure new lands and increased productivity ahead of your enemies?</li><li>The lands around you are teeming with both opportunity and danger alike. Crush the weaker minor factions littered around the world to pillage their resources, or instead cultivate friendly relations and have them join your growing empire, incorporating their distinctive units and heroes to further strengthen your people. Explore ancient ruins and strange anomalies, braving the dangers of the unknown to enrich your lands and gain powerful artifacts to wield against your enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Write Your Own Legend</strong></p><p>A deep mystery lies buried beneath the surface of this once-tranquil ocean world, where an ancient power stirs in the darkness. Gain dominion over the planet through violent conquest, seek victory through diplomatic and technological advancements, pursue quests and tackle events that can alter the course of a campaign, or empower your sworn heroes to unveil the story of your people—the choice is yours.</p><p>Will you be a ruthless conqueror or a cunning builder? A cultivated diplomat or a flesh-eating beast? Will you bring harmony back to the planet, seeking out lost legends and heroes, or will you defy the fate that drives your faction and carve a legend of your own?</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Early Access Date Trailer | PC Gaming show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bANqX6Jpv0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mcfarlane-toys-doom-diablo-mortal-kombat-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New Elite Edition series on the way.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a special IGN Live edition of Up at Noon today, McFarlane Toys’ Brian Walters (Director, Brand Creative) stopped by to chat with Max Scoville and Brian Altano about what the company has in the pipeline, including their new Elite Edition series that’s kicking off with Doom Slayer from Doom: The Dark Ages, followed by Lilith from Diablo IV. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walters said the idea behind the Elite Edition was “to create highly decorated, super detailed, iconic version of characters from games.” One way these figures stand out is by their inclusion of soft goods, such as the fur cloak on Doom Slayer, and Walters noted they were “Introducing new materials we haven’t used.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/08/purple-and-white-modern-business-youtube-thumbnail-2-1749426039362.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Walters pointed out the many accessories Doom Slayer came with, including the Pulveriser, flail, combat shotgun, and shield saw, saying he felt it was ”a really great first item for [Elite Edition].” Though pre-orders for Doom Slayer were currently sold out, Walters said the figure would be available at retailers like Walmart and Gamestop upon release. And yes, it was implied some monsters are in the works for the Doom Slayer to battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lilith in the meantime just went up for pre-order today, tied to IGN Live. Her accessories include multiple palace fates for a variety of expressions, and Williams said the idea was they were “holding nothing back with this figure,” including articulated wings and “a soft PVC tail so you can pose it however you want.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Williams said the challenge with a figure like Lilith was “the balance of executing the design but still making a functional toy. You have to make tough decisions.” He added that probably the hardest thing was pulling off “the engineering without compromising the look of the character.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/08/purple-and-white-modern-business-youtube-thumbnail-3-1749426293886.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what else McFarlane Toys had in the pipeline, there’s the Power Armor from Fallout, which is based on the game, not the series. The previous figures they made for the TV version were from the Movie Maniacs line, so the Power Armor will be the first articulated Fallout figure. Williams teased there was “more to come here. We’ve got some good surprises coming.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but not least, Williams showed off two of the figures from the upcoming Mortal Kombat Classics line - including a boxed Sub-Zero, featuring very fun retro arcade packaging that includes joystick controls on the box art and the original character select image of Sub-Zero, along with his bio, on the back. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creative-team-on-how-they-crafted-season-2s-most-crucial-episodes-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Full Spoilers for The Last of Us Season 2 follow. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">At IGN Live today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us</a> Co-Creator and Executive Producer Craig Mazin was joined by several of the show’s core creative team – including Ksenia Sereda (Cinematographer), Ann Foley (Costume Designer), Don Macaulay (Production Designer), Alex Wang (VFX Supervisor), Timothy Good (Editor), and David Fleming (Co-Composer) – to discuss the tremendous amount of work that went into the just-completed second season of the HBO series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the panel began, Mazin remarked, “The truth is that Neil [Druckmann] and I are vastly over-credited for the success of the show. We work really hard on it but these are the people that bring it to life and they deserve so much credit… All of it is necessary to make it what it is.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the panel was asked to name their favorite episode from Season 2, nearly everyone named either <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-review">episode two</a> ("Through the Valley") or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-review">episode six</a> (“The Price”), which made sense since they were such standouts - and segued nicely into the fact that these were the two episodes moderator Amelia Emberwing focused on for the conversation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Through the Valley” of course had two monumental events, including the horde of infected attacking Jackson and, well… that other thing which we’ll get back to. With footage of the massive attack sequence playing, Mazin noted that there were visual effects in basically every shot, saying, “I think Alex had to touch nearly everything here.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rewatching the attack on Jackson, Macaulay joked, “All I can think about is the thousands of meetings we have,” saying they quite seriously probably had 10 meetings about how the barrels would be launched from the town gates into the horde. As he put it, “Nearly every shot in this took 10-15 meetings. Craig loves meetings!” Even after all of that there was “a lot of retrofitting on set. Lots of rooftops we weren’t planning to do.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foley said episode two was definitely the hardest part of the season for her as the costume designer because of how many actors and extras were in that episode working on multiple filming units - and that it was all taking place while they were also working on the Seraphite costumes for upcoming episodes. As she explained, this involved "65 people in three different areas.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wang stressed that previs is crucial, and the many discussions they have about what Macaulay will build vs. what Wang will oversee being added digitally. It’s a long process, with Wang noting, “You’re planning for success 6-8 months down the line” and that he’s constantly in communication with Macaulay, the stunt team, and many more. Mazin joked that when he calls Wang in for one of his infamous meetings, “His heart sinks because he knows he’s about to go over budget again.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One reason the infected horde was so tricky was that it dealt with such a large army and as Wang explained, in the visual effects world, when you have a group that large “repetition is usually okay,” since you have characters in the same costumes or creatures of the same type. Here though, Mazin wanted to sell that these were all originally different human beings who were different sizes and ages in different outfits before they were infected. As he put it, they nearly “broke Wētā [FX]” over the specifics they asked for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s Good and his crucial work as editor. He has to begin editing without the final effects in place, which can be tricky. And not just because, as he pointed out, in the early footage “a Bloater isn’t a Bloater, it’s a green dot.” But after they may have cut of the episode they're happy with, “we get the animation back and everything’s changed. The motion’s become faster than a human actor is able to do," so they have to re-edit to adjust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it came to scoring the “Through the Valley,” Fleming described it as particularly challenging, because Mazin asked him, “How do we start this at 11 and then keep going up for the whole episode?” The idea was they were “building up momentum so it just felt relentless relentless relentless. Then at the end, it was kind of the opposite with the pivotal scene with Joel.” When Fleming paused and said he’d been avoiding talking about how that episode ended for so long, Mazin couldn’t resist chiming in: “He died!” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Fleming explained, the original music for Joel's wrenching death scene was much busier but then “Craig asked ‘strip it back.’ It was a less is more situation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While praising the performances of Pedro Pascal, Kaitlyn Dever and Bella Ramsey, Good revealed that for Joel’s death “I actually edited it five times before I was ready to show it to Craig,” because he knew how important it was to get it right. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Joel’s death scene played out, the panel couldn’t help but become somber and when Mazin cracked, “Let’s talk about the golf clubs we picked out. They have lots of meaning" to release some tension, he then paused and added that actually, when it came to which exact club Abby would use to beat Joel with, “There was a whole discussion!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation then moved to episode six and its flashbacks to Joel and Ellie together set between Season 1 and 2. The sequence where Ellie climbs the dinosaur was shown and Mazin remarked, “I love this in the game. I love that we got to do it!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added that this was a funny situation where the actual dinosaur built for Ellie to climb “was wobbling too much so then Alex stopped it from wobbling. But then it looked fake so we had to make it wobble [again] a little bit.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing Joel and Ellie’s clothes, Foley noted they did their best to match their looks in the game, though there might be slight changes occasionally for specific reasons. One such case was in the museum scene. In the game, Ellie is wearing a tank top in this sequence. However, on the show, they wanted to underline that Bella Ramsey was playing a more youthful version of Ellie in these flashback scenes, so they ended up making it a t-shirt because “changing it from a tank to a t-shirt made it look baggier and make her look younger.” In general though, “Joel and Ellie are in the same things they wear in the game because there’s no reason to change it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ksenia Sereda said she was both excited and nervous about shooting the scene where Ellie and Joel go inside the space capsule, because “the way it was done in the game was so brilliant,” including the close up on Ellie smiling, imagining going into space. Sereda joked the game provided “the most expensive previs I’ve ever had to work with.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mazin marveled how Sereda lit the screen so that all of the light changes on Ellie’s face were done practically, without visual effects needed. Sereda explained how difficult it was, because “the whole sequence is lit through this teeny tiny window on the side of the capsule. It was very challenging to find this whole look.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequence had particular significance to Mazin because “This is the first thing that Neil ever showed me from the second game.” He elaborated that when he went to Naughty Dog to speak to Druckmann about turning The Last of Us into a TV show, the team were nearing the completion of The Last of Us Part II. When Druckmann showed Mazin the space capsule sequence, his response was, “‘We’re doing that!’ In my mind, I was like, 'We need to do a good enough job for Season 1 that we’re renewed [to do that].'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Season 3 of The Last of Us now in the works, Mazin said he was eager to get back in the thick of it, turning to his fellow panelists and saying “I can’t wait to do that. I can’t wait to do that with all of you.” He then proclaimed: “Don, are we going to have meetings!!”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
