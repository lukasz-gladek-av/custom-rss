			<p>Most Nintendo franchises are very carefully curated, slowly introducing new characters and elements, while maintaining nostalgic ties to the past. Oddly, the exception to this rule is Nintendo’s very first big franchise, Donkey Kong, which the company seems happy to reboot whenever it suits their fancy. The original Donkey Kong games gave way to Rare’s Donkey Kong Country in the 90s, we got another soft reboot when Retro Studios took over the series and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced the Kremlings with tiki masks</a>, and now, Nintendo’s reinventing the whole shebang again. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> gives Nintendo’s big ape a major makeover, turning DK into a terrain-smashing brute who can literally shape the world around him with his fists.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is a bold new take, but it's one Nintendo clearly has quite a bit of confidence in, given the game is essentially standing in for a new Mario platformer during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch window. Will DK's latest reinvention be a success or leave fans pounding the ground in disappointment? I recently had the chance to go paws-on with Donkey Kong Bananza at a Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here are my general thoughts on the new hardware</a>) and you can jump on down for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After many years of mostly chilling in his treehouse, Donkey Kong has seemingly decided to make something of himself, becoming a miner who uses his fists to dig up Golden Bananas and a glittering ore named “Banandium” (naturally). Unfortunately, a villainous crew of apes, known as VoidCo, crash a meteor into DK’s mine on Ingot Island sinking all its precious treasure further underground. This sets DK off on a quest through multiple descending levels to crack some heads and retrieve as many Golden Bananas as he can.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first thing you’ll likely note upon jumping into Donkey Kong Bananza are the changes to DK himself, who has been redesigned to look a lot like he did in The Super Mario Bros. Movie (minus the Seth Rogen voice, thankfully). While there have been some kneejerk negative reactions to the new look, only a few minutes with the game will likely dispel any misgivings you might have. Frankly, the old Rare DK design was showing its age and this new look allows for a much wider range of expressions, which the developers of DK Bananza (likely the EPD Tokyo team behind Super Mario Odyssey) take full advantage of. This Donkey Kong feels like a more fleshed-out character with a full range of emotions, rather than just a dumb animal. You even get to play dress-up, as fossils you collect can be traded for new looks at a not-yet-glimpsed cosmetics store.</p>
<p>Some of the changes to Donkey Kong’s world feel a bit odd at first, like all the apes that look kind of like Diddy Kong, but <em>aren’t</em> Diddy Kong, running around, and the strange assortment of enemies. But odd isn’t necessarily bad, and much like with DK’s makeover, that feeling of “this is weird” wore off quickly. Also, during a second playthrough of the Donkey Kong Bananza demo, in which I focused on finding as many secrets as I could, I managed to locate good old Cranky Kong. This, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combined with an accidental leak from Nintendo themselves</a>, hints DK Bananza may not be quite as hard a reboot as it appears at first.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of visuals, Donkey Kong Bananza goes for a unique, stylized look. For instance, the fuzzy fur shading that’s adorned DK for years has been replaced with almost scale-like layers of fur. Similarly, the world of DK Bananza features a lot of intentionally off-kilter, sharp angles and brash colors. This isn’t the most cohesive visual style Nintendo has ever come up with, but everything has a nice, sharp, bold look that makes this world stand out on the new Switch 2 hardware. Meanwhile, the game runs at a nice mostly-smooth 60fps, with only a few brief hiccups detected.</p>
<p>As for how Donkey Kong Bananza plays, the game’s central gimmick becomes apparent very quickly – this time around, DK doesn’t just smash baddies with his fists, he can now use them to plow into the terrain, with a surprising amount of the environment being destructible. DK can punch forward, downward, and up, as well as slam down from above after a jump. Additionally, he can grab chunks of rock and dirt to throw and clamber up pretty much any vertical surface.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's a simple, yet versatile, set of tools for traversing and shaping the world, which makes Donkey Kong Bananza almost feel like a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. The Mario Odyssey roots are clear, with the stage I explored having both explicitly-stated missions to achieve and extra Golden Bananas hidden all over for those who choose to (literally) dig a bit deeper. While the actual platforming in the level I played was very rudimentary, there are bonus stages to uncover that provide more traditional “run, jump, and fight” challenges. The demo even culminated in a basic boss battle of sorts.</p>
<p>And yet, as mentioned, Donkey Kong Bananza also seems to embody some of that Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom “go crazy, do things your way” ethos. Do you want to stick to the golden path? Search carefully for secrets? Or just lay waste to everything around you? It’s up to each individual player. There were also some simple puzzle elements found in the demo, in the form of small concrete sections of the environment that could be destroyed by throwing explosive materials at them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like Tears of the Kingdom, there were also moments when the amount of freedom Donkey Kong Bananza allows made the game feel a bit messy. At times I'd find myself digging into the ground when I simply wanted to attack an enemy, and once burrowed in there, the camera sometimes made it tough to keep track of where I was. There was also an odd issue where turning the camera would sometimes make most of the world disappear into a purple void for a second, which I assume will be fixed before launch.</p>
<p>While the issues I just mentioned caused some momentary frustration, I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></h2>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza swings the franchise in a bold direction, giving the ape himself a personality-packed makeover and offering up gameplay that combines the sandbox platforming formula of Super Mario Odyssey with the open-ended, play-as-you-will ethos of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While the demo I played was a bit rough around the edges in some respects, DK Bananza promises to potentially be an amalgamation of some of Nintendo’s most acclaimed games of recent years. We don’t know for sure if that will be the case yet, but I’m eager to unpeel the full package and find out.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17. Look for more Wccftech coverage of the game closer to launch.</p>

Not all of it is pretty. A lot of it is sad and painful.

Instead, it spotlights race, slavery, poverty, generational trauma, and death. Because of its rich, complex, often painful history, the South has developed a unique, beautiful folkloric tapestry of tall tales, heroes, and monsters. And <em>South of Midnight </em>literally lets you weave and unweave this tapestry via a 12-13 hour single-player adventure through its mystical but grounded spin on the American South.</p><p>In <em>South of Midnight</em>, you play as a young Black woman named Hazel Flood. She’s a talented athlete who has a mother consumed with helping abused kids. While this causes some drama between the two, she still cares greatly for her mother. So when a hurricane washes their trailer away down the river, Hazel chases after it and finds herself in a strange and magical version of the South, complete with nasty ghost monsters called haints, who linger in our world after someone has suffered greatly.</p><p>Thankfully, very early on in the game, you discover that Hazel is special. She’s a Weaver, a person who can see the threads of reality and can weave space and time using magical artifacts like sewing needles. The last Weaver to exist was a former slave woman who helped other slaves escape their masters and find freedom. Throughout the game, Hazel learns more about her powers and her connection to the world via this woman and her journey to help a single family escape slavery.</p><p>Of course, this is a video game, so Hazel’s newfound weaving powers allow her to kick ass, double jump, and solve puzzles, too. Sadly, this is where <em>South of Midnight </em>unravels a bit. </p><p>The combat in the game always happens in locked-off arena-like spaces where enemies spawn for a while until you defeat them all and can “pop” a cursed bit of the world and free yourself from the encounter. You do this a lot in <em>South of Midnight</em>, and it gets repetitive quickly, partly because every fight feels the same and also because the combat is serviceable but not much more than that. You can dodge, you can charge some attacks, and you have a stun and some upgrades. If you’ve played a video game in the last decade, none of this will be terribly exciting or feel unique at all. It’s not bad, per se, just stale and easily the weakest part of <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><p>Hazel’s Weaver abilities are more fun to use when you’re platforming and solving puzzles, and I wish there was more of that in the game and less of the 100+ arenas you have to fight through to reach the end, which is a big combat arena that left a sour taste in my mouth.</p><p>Here’s the thing, though: In the end, I don’t really care that the combat is just so-so and serviceable. That’s because everything else in this game is so good that I can overlook some boring punchy bits.</p><p>The world of <em>South of Midnight</em> is gorgeous. The stop-motion-like animations of characters and critters help sell the painted, hand-crafted feel of every level in the game. Each location in <em>South of Midnight</em> is meticulously detailed and covered in little touches—like animals off in the distance or screaming cicadas—that help immerse you in the game’s lively, stylized slice of the deep South. And it’s not all swamps.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em>’s locales are greatly varied, offering disgusting places like a town flooded with pig shit-filled water and cool forests dotted with abandoned company towns and slave quarters. And throughout your journey, incredible lighting makes every area distinct, from sun-drenched levels that feel hot and muggy to spooky swamps that feel claustrophobic and dark. I spent a lot of time in <em>South of Midnight</em>, stopping and taking screenshots of every level. And I expect I’m not alone.</p><p>Another key part of <em>South of Midnight</em>’s charm is its wonderful and very Southern music. Many levels in the game feature songs with lyrics directly related to the mythical or supernatural entity or creature you are dealing with, all of them based on real Southern folklore. </p><figure id="" data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some songs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like a twangy Dolly Parton-esque diddy about a massive gator named Two-Toed Tom</a></span>, stuck with me for days after playing the game. These songs run the gamut from country to blues to jazz and feature banjos, acoustic guitars, lyrics about heaven and hell, and folk singers belting out sometimes depressing allegories about the past. It’s unlike any video game soundtrack I’ve heard this year, and it will stay with me long after I move on to other games.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is going to be a game that I predict some people will bounce off of after just a few hours. A big reason will be that the combat isn’t anything to write home about. And the first few levels, while gorgeous and filled with great tunes, aren’t as exciting as what follows after the game gives you more abilities, like a double jump. </p><p>But if you can push through some of those issues, what you’ll discover is a wonderful and heartfelt adventure through American history and Southern folklore that is unlike any game I’ve played. Like the South itself, <em>South of Midnight</em> is a messy, complicated, but often beautiful and passionate thing worth experiencing. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <div>
      <div><p>This past weekend, the Kickstarter campaign for <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> concluded. The campaign for this fantasy TTRPG, based on Balkan and Slavic folklore, was funded within 20 minutes of going life and ended with more than 10 times its goal.</p>



<p>According to its official campaign page, Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch is a TTRPG supplement heavily inspired by grim tales from Balkan and Slavic folklore. It's a supplement compatible with the current edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and Son of Oak's hotly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legend in the Mist</em></a> system.</p>

The material includes new character options, locals, eerie magic items, spells, and monsters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the books contained detailed information on the land of Zamanora as well as prewritten adventure. In keeping with the grim tone, the books include new rules for vampirism, lycanthropy, and debilitating curses.</p>

<p>This culture influence extends to unique gameplay mechanics. Players can abjure evil spirits as a Kuker or hunt down terrors of the knight as a Krsnic. Imbue poppets with magical power or perform communal ceremonies to cast powerful spells. There's even a system tracking the creeping influence of the Hidden World on the real world, an influence that affects mind and body.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers of <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> Kickstarter campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital PDFs for $44:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $53:</strong> Digital and Physical copy of the Core Book</li>
	<li><strong>All Digital for $83:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables, Digital Assets and Tokens for VTTs, full support for Foundry VTT, and an STL file for the Baba Yaga miniature</li>
	<li><strong>The Slipcase for $105</strong>: Digital and Physical copies of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables, GM Screen, and physical art prints</li>
	<li><strong>Core Box for $181:</strong> Everything in The Slipcase tier, a set of miniature standees, Forest Warden dice, and The Adventure Deck</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Box for $324:</strong> Everything in the Core Box and All Digital tier, A deluxe Hardcover copy of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables book, monster deck, magic item cards, and Wayfarer's Journal</li>
	<li><strong>Collector's Box for $658:</strong> Everything from the Deluxe Box tier, signed copies of both core books, a handmade crochet doll of Oh, The Forest Warden, and a master print of the Baba Yaga miniature</li>
</ul><p>It must be noted that the developers address potential import costs for Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch in light of recent US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. According to the campaign, all orders made in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK will be handled within fulfillment centers in said countries. Which means import taxes should be no problem. You will still need to pay for shipping.</p>

<p>The campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$327,152, which is more than ten times their initial funding goal of $</span></span><span><span><span>$21,905. You can still back the project at any tier at time of writing.</span></span></span></p>

                <p>Nintendo has said that Switch 2's eShop won't have any theme music, just like the first Switch didn't, as a result of not wanting to disrupt the user experience.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said, "Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games." Before the Switch, systems like Wii and Wii U had music themes playing as users browsed their respective eShops.

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2’s</a> Joy-Con 2 controllers will not feature Hall Effect analogue sticks, which is sure to raise fears about Joy-Con drift rearing its head for the new generation console.</p>
<p>Having been rather coy about the underlying technology in press Q&amp;A sessions last week, Nintendo Life were able to get an actual answer out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">Nintendo of America’s Nate Bihldorff</a>, who confirmed that the new Joy-Con will not have Hall Effect sticks… but doesn’t state definitively whether that applies to the new Pro Controller.</p>


<p><strong>Nintendo Life – &nbsp;Let’s jump off the sensitivity stuff then and talk about the stick of the Switch 2 Joy-Con because it feels so different to the original Switch’s analog stick. So is it a Hall Effect stick? Were you inspired by the Hall Effect stick?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nate Bihldorff</strong> – Well, the Joy-Con 2’s controllers have been designed from the ground up. They’re not Hall Effect sticks, but they feel really good. Did you experience both the Joy-Con and the Pro Controller?</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life – Both!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nate Bihldorff</strong> – So, I like both, but that Pro Controller, for some reason the first time I grabbed it, I was like, “this feels like a GameCube controller.” I was a GameCube guy. Something about it felt so familiar, but the stick on that especially. I tried to spend a lot of time making sure that it was quiet. I don’t know if you tried really whacking the stick around but it really is [quiet]. I’m thinking back to my Smash Brothers days, where you just whack it. [The Switch 2 Pro Controller] is one of the quietest controllers I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>There’s certainly the possibility that the new Pro Controller has Hall Effect sticks, given that it has added features like back buttons that are typical of pro controllers, but we wouldn’t put money on it.</p>
<p>Having new analogue stick modules that are “designed from the ground up” could make them more resistant to the issue, but this will stil be massively disappointing for anyone who’s had Joy-Con Drift through the Nintendo Switch generation. Potentiometer analogue sticks use physical contact to determine the position of the stick, but this is prone to being worn down over time, and can have dust and residue build up that prevents a good contact. As this happens, Joy-Con can start to “drift” giving an incorrect reading from a neutral position that leads to a consistent directional input.</p>
<p>By contrast, Hall Effect sensors measure magnetic fields instead of using direct contact, making them nigh on impervious to the problem.</p>
<p>It’s not an issue that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch – there’s definitely been an uptick in awareness of the problem amongst PlayStation and Xbox gamers as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/22/nintendo-joycon-drifting-fix-drift-legal-action/">Joy-Con Drift led to lawsuits</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/03/nintendo-will-fix-all-drifting-joy-con-for-free-in-uk-and-eu-even-outside-of-warranty/">Nintendo implementing blanket repair programmes</a> in certain regions, and a cottage industry of DIY repair kits on any open online marketplace. It even went so far that some accessory makers started to produce Hall Effect sticks and both offer them standalone, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/10/the-nyxi-wizard-is-a-gamecube-style-switch-joy-con-with-drift-proof-analogue-sticks/">use them extensively in third party and pro controllers</a>.</p>
<p>At the very least, we hope that Joy-Con 2 continue to use easily replaceable modules, as opposed to soldering the analogue sticks in place, making them better for repair, both at repair partners and by end users.</p>

<h3 id="h-major-regional-qualifiers-mrq">Major Regional Qualifiers (MRQ)</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-qualifiers-will-be-played-entirely-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Major Regional Qualifiers</a> are six qualifier tournaments that will determine the 16 teams that will qualify for Stage 1 of the Major.</p>



<p>Here is the distribution of teams that will qualify for Stage 1 via the MRQs, and the teams that will compete in each region’s MRQ.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/nintendos-ego-is-likely-why-switch-2-welcome-tour-isnt-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It goes without saying that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 showcase</a> and its announcements will be the biggest news of the year, but it was soured somewhat by an egotistical and elitist decision by Nintendo. They decided to make the greedy decision to charge money for what is nothing more than an interactive manual.</p>

<p><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a neat idea for a game to showcase the unique features of the Switch 2. You move a character around a huge Switch 2 to learn in message prompts and tech demos how everything works. A simple idea that I think most people would happily at least check out. We'd rather play something to show us what's new on Switch 2 than read about it, right?</p>

<h2><em>Welcome Tour</em> Is Certainly Not An <em>Astro's Playroom</em></h2>

<p>I am very down to screw around with whatever little clever demos Nintendo will have to show off the weird features that their first-party games will likely be the only ones to use. Pay for the privilege of participating in what is essentially marketing material though? Nintendo, you’re out of your mind.</p>

<p>The natural comparison is <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, the free game that comes with every PlayStation 5. It shows off all the cool features of the DualSense controller in a cleverly designed platformer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would have no problem paying for <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> at all, as there’s still the meat of a game to sink into even if I don’t care about the neat PlayStation easter eggs or DualSense showcases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=V2GdkJx3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=cECsYTmk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love PowerPoint, <em>Welcome Tour</em> may just be for you.</figcaption></figure><p>While I haven’t had a chance to check out <em>Welcome Tour</em> myself, there are <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/04/a-premium-instruction-manual" rel="nofollow">plenty of previews</a>&nbsp;from outlets that did have an opportunity. All come to a similar conclusion: <em>Welcome Tour </em>is not a game and no one knows what audience exists, if any, that would happily pay for it.</p>

<p>What makes this all even more baffling is that Nintendo had what is inarguably the greatest sales multiplier ever packed in for free in a console with <em>Wii Sports</em>. The Wii’s motion controls were novel and everyone had an immediate showcase of why they were so awesome. I bet a ton of homes still have a Wii hooked up and in use from time to time just for bowling.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Welcome Tour </em>doesn’t seem set up in the least to fill the same role as something like <em>Wii Sports</em>, but Nintendo has seen what free launch games can do. If this is nothing more than some mere marketing material in a snazzy presentation, I can’t quite understand the rationale to get to the decision to charge for it.</p>

<p>Maybe they see <em>Welcome Tour</em> as a mere curiosity that most aren't interested in so they want at least some return, where the potential value of getting something like <em>Wii Sports</em> into people's hands right away is readily understood. I refuse to believe that they think the attach rate for <em>Welcome Tour</em> will be all that high, though who knows what a company that seems to spin gold thinks about anything they create.</p>

<h2><em>Wii Sports</em> Was Free, So Why Not <em>Welcome Tour</em>?</h2>

<p>Nintendo hardly ever gives us insight into their decision making, design process, etc, though, so we'll never get a straight answer. They are pretty happy to go at their own pace and do their own thing. Obviously, it works out for them the majority of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We did get some insight from a book by Reggie Fils-Aimé, the former President of Nintendo of America, however. You can find an outline of the relevant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/reggie-had-to-fight-for-wii-sports-as-a-pack-in-and-miyamoto-wasnt-happy" rel="nofollow">excerpt here from Nintendo Life</a>.</p>

<p>As a quick summary, Reggie and others, particularly from Nintendo of America, were making the argument to include <em>Wii Sports </em>as a free pack-in with the Wii to then President of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata. Obviously, their arguments won out in the end, but there was strong disagreement from legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Miyamoto is quoted as saying, “We do not give away our software,” citing the difficulty that comes in creating games.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=eh4zfmEv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=6tePiPSB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wii Sports</em> had golf, too, just a whole lot more of it.</figcaption></figure><p>In this context with <em>Wii Sports</em>, I am completely sympathetic to Miyamoto’s position here. Obviously, any game, particularly one trying to introduce a whole new way for players to interact with games, is incredibly hard to make well. I think Miyamoto and Nintendo’s track record overall speaks for itself in just how seriously they take making games and making them extremely well.</p>

<p>To toss in a game for free despite all of the hard work, sacrifice, and effort that it took to get it made in the first place? I can see why someone on the creative side like Miyamoto would be annoyed. It can easily come across as a devaluation of game designers’ work overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back to <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour,</em> well, it’s no <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, or even <em>Nintendo Land</em> for that matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Welcome Tour</em> is a virtual tour that looks more like a museum exhibit with PowerPoint presentations and minigames (emphasis on the mini) scattered throughout. As a real-life exhibit to showcase anything from Nintendo, that sounds pretty rad. A game from the company that emphasizes fun in all aspects of their game design that amounts to pretty basic edutainment is certainly not comparable.</p>

<h2>Not Everything You Touch is Gold, Nintendo</h2>

<p>So, Miyamoto and Nintendo overall, I totally stand with you on the righteous side of properly valuing the hard work of creatives. <em>Welcome Tour</em> just isn’t that, though, is it?</p>

<p>That is not to discount the hard work that went into its creation, however. But this is not a piece of software you're selling, it's an interactive instruction manual that should be categorized as marketing more than anything. Consumers aren't scrambling to pay for obvious ads, though. People don’t pay a premium to have ads put back into their services, right?</p>

<p>While Miyamoto’s quote above wasn’t about <em>Welcome Tour</em>, it’s hard not to see its potential influence in such a weird decision here. The arrogance to believe that this is in the same realm as something like a new <em>Mario </em>game is ego gone too far—this is just souped-up marketing material if Nintendo is being honest with themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope Nintendo reevaluates their position on this one, but it doesn’t seem like people will miss much if they don’t feel like shelling out for it anyway.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>'s live-action movie adaptation has reportedly found its writer and director, with A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski said to be at the helm.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/">Deadline</a>, Sarnoski - whose other directorial credits include 2021's Nicholas Cage-starring Pig and the upcoming Death of Robin Hood - will serve as director <em>and</em> writer on the project, which is a joint venture between Kojima Productions and A24.
</p>
<p>
A Death Stranding movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">initially announced in December 2022</a>, when it was said to be "on the fast track with development underway". Not long after, Kojima revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-taking-an-arthouse-approach-with-death-standing-movie">he's "aiming for a more arthouse approach" with the movie</a>, so it made total sense when last year brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">news of his partnership with A24</a> - the production and distribution company behind the likes of The Brutalist, Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All At One, and The Zone of Interest.

<p>
Beyond Sarnoski's reported involvement, little has been revealed about the Death Standing movie so far. It'll take place in the same post-apocalyptic setting as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sams-from-all-over-the-world-are-still-delivering-celebrates-kojima-with-latest-death-stranding-milestone">extremely popular</a> first game - which presumably means it'll also features invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, and other outlandish delights - but it's unclear if it'll be a direct adaptation or a brand-new story.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it sound like the Death Stranding movie is still some way off - but it's unlikely series fans will be too concerned given a fully fledged game sequel is launching very soon. As revealed last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> launches for PS5 on 26th June, complete with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">its very own fake Snake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">stop-motion puppet companion</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025.1157580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warzone Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the Kilo 141 to cause chaos in Verdansk. Our Loadout will make the iconic AR dominate just as much as it did back in 2021.</p>



<p>Longtime series veterans will feel right at home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> in Season 3. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/">HDR</a>, Grau, and Kilo 141 are all back, giving players access to the four weapons that initially reigned supreme on the map.</p>



<p>In addition, Verdansk has a fresh coat of paint, as Raven Software improved the beloved map with enhanced visuals, lighting, and new textures. As players return and try to determine which AR is the best in Season 3, the Kilo 141 stands out as a clear contender.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Which Optic you use comes down to personal preference, but the other attachments are a must. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/wz3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueGameData</a>, The <strong>AK-74 and CR-56 AMAX</strong> have the <strong>two fastest time-to-kill speeds</strong> among long-range meta weapons. In saying that, the Kilo 141 isn’t too far behind, and the AR is easier to control due to its forgiving recoil pattern and steady fire rate.</p>



<p>Although you won’t get the same damage output from the Kilo 141 as with the CR-56 AMAX or AK-74, the reliable AR has a faster fire rate and bullet velocity than other top choices and shines even brighter with this set of attachments. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Willis 3X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Monolithic Suppressor </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>UnderBarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II </li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Be aware that this SMG does have some kick despite the attachments. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the Kilo 141 is better suited for medium and long-range engagements, the best sidekick for this AR is an SMG to support short-range gunfights between 0 and 10 meters. </p>



<p>After having its maximum, medium, and minimum damage ranges buffed in Season 3 and its upper torso damage multiplier, the Kompakt 92 has the fastest time-to-kill of 550 milliseconds up to 13 meters away. A difficult-to-reign-in recoil pattern means using this SMG requires significant skill, but it’s lethal in the right hands. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Infiltrator Stockn</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Scavenger</strong>, <strong>Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Alertness</strong> are the best trio of Perks in Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Scavenger (Start equipped with maximum reserve ammo for your primary weapon. Resupply ammo equipment and plates from dead enemies)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Tracker (See enemy footsteps. Bullets you fire briefly outline an enemy for you and your squad)</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Alertness (Sense enemies when enemies are nearby. Tell when you are being aimed at by the enemy)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Since armor plates are so hard to come by, <strong>Scavenger</strong> is a must-use Perk for every loadout because you can get more armor off dead enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, losing enemies while chasing after them on Verdansk is easy, so <strong>Tracker </strong>allows you to see their recent footsteps. Also, hitting an enemy further away increases the time they are outlined. And even though Raven Software added new objects on the map to provide cover in open areas, there is always the danger of getting taken out by a one-shot sniper or an enemy with better positioning than you. <strong>Alertness</strong> alleviates this issue by pinging your screen when someone sees you.</p>







<p><strong>Overkill</strong> is the best Wildcard to use. In Season 3, Raven Software removed the ability to purchase loadout weapons from the Buy Station. As a result, the only way to acquire loadout weapons is through loadout drops. </p>



<p>So, while having three extra attachments on a weapon with the Gunfighter Wildcard would be nice, we recommend using Overkill to give you a second primary weapon because acquiring one will otherwise be difficult. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-kilo-141-in-warzone">How to unlock Kilo 141 in Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>The Kilo 141 is a reward in Warzone’s return to Verdansk event, meaning all you have to do is log in to the battle royale to unlock the AR instantly.</strong></p>

This video game movie has had the support of various toy marketing campaigns from the very beginning, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> as well as McDonald's toys targeted specifically at adults. But if you're in the market for a Nerf gun after seeing the movie in theaters, you also already have quite a few options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is offering new discounts on a variety of Nerf <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Weapons">Minecraft weapons</a> based on <em>actual </em>Minecraft weapons. Each of these Nerf picks have the ability to shoot darts, even if they don't necessarily appear to be able to. They are also all fairly cheap compared to other Minecraft toys on the market right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Nerf Minecraft Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four Nerf Minecraft deals at Amazon right now, and almost all of them are at their lowest prices of 2025. The best deal within this list is the Minecraft Pillager's Crossbow, which has only recently <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CSLJH4M5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">droppped to its lowest-ever price</a> of $19.99. This is one of the most affordable Nerf crossbows you can buy, and it also doubles as a wonderful Minecraft gift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of this blaster, there's also the Nerf Minecraft axe and hammer, which are each under $20 and at their lowest prices in 2025. While they don't function as effectively as a standard Nerf gun, they look awesome and are still able to fire darts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Nerf Minecraft option that is on sale is the Sabrewing Motorized Blaster. Although it is arguably the coolest thing on sale right now, it is nowhere near its lowest price of 2025. It is, however, still priced below $20 and is the most enticing actualy Nerf Blaster on this list. It also has the largest dart capacity at eight darts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Nerf Ammo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve secured a Nerf Blaster, grabbing some extra darts or rounds is always a good idea. If you’ve ever played with one of these before, you know that ammo goes missing way too quickly. Luckily, a range of nerf darts are on sale. Big 100 packs for an epic war with friends or smaller, ultra-cheap sets to replace a few missing darts are all discounted right now. Just be sure to grab the right ammo.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 7, 2025 4:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, sci-fi co-operative shooter from the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, now known as Reburn. We now have a release date set for this new shooter.</p>
<p>It'll be arriving on PC on Steam at the end of this month, on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, though anyone who is keen to try the game as soon as possible can request to be a part of a closed beta test the studio is hosting for 24 hours beginning this Saturday, April 12, 2025. You can register your interest for the beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>La Quimera takes players to a dystopian version of Latin America in the year 2064, where most of the global systems we know today have collapsed, and humanity continues on in fractured segments around the world. It's a confusing and chaotic time, but it's also the golden age for private mercenary forces, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>That setting is also what lends the game to its cooperative experience while also being a story-driven game. You can play through the story with two friends alongside you, taking advantage of all the futuristic gadgets you'll have, like exoskeletons that make you stronger and faster and weapons that are unlike any of the killing machines we have today.</p>
<p>Along with announcing the release date, Reburn also revealed a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, Reburn's chief executive officer and co-founder, also added in the announcement that "<em>Our Reburn team can't wait to finally share our hard work and vision for La Quimera on April 25. </em><em>[...] As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn't be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we're profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience."</em></p>

One solution to this problem is to use Hall Effect thumbsticks that are basically resistant to drifting as they use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetic fields</a></span> and are less susceptible to parts wearing down and failing over time.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 will be released on April 8 across all platforms. It will bring improvements, bug fixes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-title-update-1-0-2">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows development team has been working on this first batch of improvements since launch, and the changes in this update have been inspired by player feedback. Title update 1.0.2 for AC Shadows features several highlights, including selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to reset mastery nodes, horse improvements, an Investigation Board shortcut and PS5 Pro enhancements. Check out all the new improvements and changes in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 below:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-horse-improvements">Horse Improvements</h3>



<p>The first significant improvement from tomorrow’s AC Shadows update features changes towards the horse. Players can activate the pathfinder to enable Auto-Follow, and the horse will automatically follow the road to the destination. Also, horses are now quicker in cities, so players can glide through these areas much faster.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mastery-nodes-reset">Mastery Nodes Reset</h3>



<p>Many fans will appreciate this change as it lets them fine-tune their builds according to their preferred play styles. Players can now reset Mastery Nodes for both Yasuke and Naoe, allowing you to test different play styles before finding what suits you the best. It also lets you explore all the game has to offer gameplay-wise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-selling-and-dismantling-multiple-items">Selling and Dismantling Multiple Items</h3>



<p>This is an exciting update for players who have been hoarding resources during exploration. It will allow them to manage and utilize their surplus items efficiently. The new update will add an option to tag and sell/dismantle multiple items in shops or while dismantling gear at the Forge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-investigation-board-shortcut">Investigation Board Shortcut</h3>



<p>One of the features of the new update will let you reach the investigation board faster than ever before. After the update is released, you only need to hold the ‘Options’ button for a few seconds to teleport to the Investigation Board. A single press will still let you open the inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-ps5-pro-improvements-for-ac-shadows">PS5 Pro Improvements for AC Shadows</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has received dedicated PS5 Pro improvements in Title Update 1.0.2. Firstly, PSSR support has been added, and players playing before the upcoming update must manually enable this mode through video settings. Also, the balanced mode will feature ‘Raytraced Specular,’ providing visual fidelity close to PS5 Pro Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-other-improvements-in-new-ac-shadows-update">Other Improvements in New AC Shadows Update</h3>



<p>The upcoming update includes some miscellaneous improvements across the game; you can check them in the list below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>The Hideout framerate has been uncapped to above 30 fps in Performance Mode.</li>



<li>Boss fights have received improved balancing.</li>



<li>An issue where the pathfinder line appeared in photos taken in Photomode has been fixed.</li>



<li>Inconsistencies with the ‘Throw a Kunai at the closest enemy after an assassination’ perk when ‘The Tool Master Gear’ is equipped on Naoe have been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Double Assassinations have been improved.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Naoe’s responsiveness, in some instances, has been improved.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to Aftermath’s second Inside Baseball week, a whole week of stories about the ins and outs of video game development, games journalism, and what it’s like to run a worker-owned website.</p><p>We did our first <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/inside-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside Baseball</a> week back when Aftermath was just four months old, and it turned out to be one of the most fun (and successful) weeks in the site’s history. In the time since, we’ve been doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of the</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of work</a> that inspired that first theme week, and we want to use this Inside Baseball week to celebrate the best of what Aftermath can do: tell the stories of real people in game development and games journalism, dig deeply into niche topics, tell you how journalism works, and do the kinds of off-the-cuff blogs that other sites have less and less room for in their owners’ pursuit of traffic and ad dollars.</p><p>We tell you this a lot, but we can only do all of this because of YOU, our readers. The growth of the site since our first Inside Baseball week has been incredible; thanks to you, we’ve been able to bring on a new contributor, run more freelance stories, start a new podcast, and more. (We’ll have a bigger update on our goal this week.) If you’re a subscriber, <strong>thank you</strong>–every single one of you who believes in what we’re doing here, who sends us tips, who makes our Discord fun and our comments worth reading, who shares our work or says nice things about the site on social media or in our inboxes. We’ve been at this a while, but it still amazes us that Aftermath isn’t just working, but growing and thriving. None of that would be possible without you and your support.</p><p>If you aren’t a subscriber yet, but you’ve been curious about us or enjoying our work, we’d love to have you. We have a <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">range of subscription tiers</a>, as well as gift subscriptions if you have a journalism-loving person in your life. We know times are tough right now, so if a subscription isn’t in the cards, we’d love it if you’d spread the word about Aftermath, contribute to our <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tip jar</a>, or just let us know you're enjoying the site.</p><p>We started Aftermath when things were looking pretty bleak for journalism, and… well, they aren’t looking much better. But this site has been a bright spot for us–not just because it helps pay our bills, but because we can get up every day and make the work we want for readers who want it too, without having to squeeze in ad breaks or justify ourselves to owners. We’ll keep doing it for as long as we can, and we're so glad to have you with us.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders"><h3>Nintendo’s Long Line Of Hits Followed By Misses Might Continue With Switch 2</h3></a><p>"The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Jack Black’s Steve introduces the newly arrived humans to his village, young teenager Henry sees a pig walk past wearing a crown. He asks, “Is he some kind of king?” And for those in the know, the blubbing begins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re a follower of <em>Minecraft</em> on YouTube, or the parent of one, you’ll inevitably have heard of Technoblade. The YouTuber, whose real name was Alexander, tragically died from cancer in 2022, aged only 22. A member of Dream SMP, which featured many of the biggest names in the field, Technoblade became known for his incredible skill at the game, and for a YouTube channel with 11 million subscribers.</p><p>Since his untimely death, Technoblade has been canonized by his contemporaries and followers, his name spoken with a lovely reverence. My own kid, only really getting into <em>Minecraft </em>YouTube since Technoblade’s passing, has learned this reverential tone and almost whispers his name. The point is, he was a great YouTuber, respected by his peers, and someone who actively fought against fame for the protection of his family. (His first name only became known after he died, and his last name is still unknown.) One of the many lines of text that can appear when you launch <em>Minecraft </em>reads “Technoblade never dies!”</p><p>So back to that scene in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. The bejeweled pig that Henry spots is a reference to Technoblade, whose in-game avatar was a bipedal pig wearing a crown (as seen in the image at the top of this article). The character asks, “Is he some kind of king?”</p><p>“No,” says Jack Black, before a long pause. Then with gravitas adds, “He’s a <em>legend</em>.”</p><p>You can see the moment in somewhat dubiously sourced footage in the following video:</p><p>Before the line had been delivered, just when the pig appeared on screen, all around me in the movie theater I heard kids going, “Technoblade!” with absolute delight in their voices. My son leant over to me and whispered with wide eyes, “That was Technoblade! That pig was Technoblade!” When he explained the reference to my wife in the parking lot as we left, and then solemnly delivered the “No, he’s a legend” line, she cried. She’d never even heard of him before, but the sincerity and touching nature of the tribute—it’s making me well up a bit as I type.</p><p>It turns out it’s only in the movie thanks to the kid playing Henry. According to an interview with director Jared Hess <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Collider</em></a></span>, Sebastian Hansen approached him during the film’s prep and said, “Look, there’s this amazing <em>Minecraft</em> player named Technoblade who passed away, and I would love to be able to honor him somehow in the film.” Hess says he spoke with the design team, and they worked it all out.</p><p>It’s fun to note there were many other easter eggs hidden in there for <em>Minecraft</em> diehards, like a Totem of Undying in Steve’s collection that would make the characters’ journey so much easier if only they knew what it was. And there was another theaterful of excited murmuring when Mojang’s Jens Bergensten appears as a silent waiter in a blink-or-miss-it moment. But of all the film’s fleeting nods to this or that, the tribute to Technoblade is the most special, and no doubt the one that will cause the most lips to quiver with emotion.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft’s stock prices have continued to fall, hitting a 12-year low on both the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBI-FR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paris Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a>. As of the markets closing in the region, Ubisoft stock is trading under €9 for the first time since April 2013.</p>



<p>As of publishing, the stock is sitting at €8.80 after falling another 7.83% on Monday. At one point it sat at €8.27 before it rose back to the closing number.</p>



<p>The reasons for the continued drop of Ubisoft’s stock prices should be surprising to anyone who has followed the company over the years. Since April 2024, Ubisoft’s shares have fallen 62.9% from its 52-week high of €23.70 to the €8.80 it currently sits. The company’s shares fell under €10 back in late October 2024 when it was announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed to 2025. However, it rebounded slightly back to over €14 per share not long after.</p>







<p>Fast forward to late March and early April, the company’s prices continued to gradually drop again. The big drop came, however, after Ubisoft announced it had reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Tencent</a> on a new subsidiary that would include the publisher’s three biggest franchises—Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin’s Creed—and give Tencent a 25% stake in the new venture. After a slight uptick, stock prices fell from €13.15 on March 27, the day of the deal, to €10.70 in just three days of trading. Since then, the prices continued to fall to what they are now. </p>



<p>There’s also the global uncertainty surrounding a potential recession that has the entire market falling over the last handful days. </p>



<p>Do you make anything of Ubisoft’s stock prices continuing to fall lately? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
