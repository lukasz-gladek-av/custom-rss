			<p>On the heels of releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-title-update-1-1-2-0-new-map-aim-assist-change/">the second major update</a> to Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">in its Season 1 roadmap</a>, EA will let players who haven't yet bought into Battlefield this year try it out for themselves with a week-long free trial of the game's classic multiplayer, specifically its flagship All-Out Warfare.</p>



<p>The free trial will kick off on November 25, 2025, and last for a full week until December 2, 2025. Players will be able to play five different game modes across three maps, including the two most recently released maps, Blackwell Fields and Eastwood.</p>



<p>"<em>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free for everyone</em>," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap">blog post on the Battlefield 6 website reads</a>. "<em>Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield's iconic massive scale warfare</em> <em>in Conquest or Breakthrough</em>."</p>



<p>The free trial goes live less than two weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is reportedly missing the mark when it comes to commercial sales, according to early sales reports. In the EU specifically, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">Black Ops 7 was 63% behind the first week EU sales for Battlefield 6</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-has-forever-changed-how-i-look-at-the-legendary-rpg-series.1361278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>I spent several hours over the past weeks trying to think of a single remake that’s comparable to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, and I couldn’t. I thought about 2023’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>remake, which changes the controls, the tone, and even the content of 2005’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span>. However, I could still use my knowledge of the original game to progress through the remake, which for the most part I can’t with </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>. I thought about </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>, which dramatically overhauls the core systems of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> and changes the narrative in ways that deliberately play with fan expectations. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>, however,</span> <span>clearly </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>want to be recognized as the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games, not as a riff or commentary on them, as it primarily adds to each game’s overarching story rather than changing it outright.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even 2024’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is a tangibly different beast than this, as it still generally adhered to the NES-era storytelling of its source material in ways that </span><i><span>I+II</span></i><span> do not. I realized my best point of comparison for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>was actually movies like </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>(1995) and </span><i><span>10 Things I Hate About You </span></i><span>(1999). Those adaptations are directly based on the works of Austen and Shakespeare respectively, but they are not bound to those works. Instead, they are movies made unapologetically for the audiences of their time, treating their source material as an outline to follow rather than something to “remake.” </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>is a more interesting flick if you’ve read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>and can compare the two works. However, if you told someone “I’ve experienced </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>because I watched </span><i><span>Clueless</span></i><span>,” they’d tell you to at least pretend to read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>like everyone else who sleepwalked their way to a Bachelor of Arts in English.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>is similarly disinterested in recapturing the essence of the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games. As a package it instead strikes me as more akin to a modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>game, with enough retro sensibilities to appeal to fans of Square Enix’s greater “HD-2D” catalogue (like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459"><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i></a> <span>or the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/philabieldia-switch-nintendo-direct-elliot-jrpg-1851787431"><i><span>The Adventures of Elliot</span></i></a><span>). Given that these two games have seen countless remakes that mainly iterate on 1993’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; II</span></i><span> for the Super Famicom, a more transformative take on these classics feels overdue. But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>rides such a fine line between honoring its source material and reinventing it for the modern era that I’ve found myself completely changing the way I even look at the two games it’s based on. To explain what I mean by that, we’ll have to look at these games next to their former counterparts and answer a simple, yet overwhelming question: What even is </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>?</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646279">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I</em>: The bones are the RPG</b></h2> <p><span>The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, released in Japan in 1986, is sometimes called “the first RPG.” However, that isn’t really true. Series like </span><i><span>Wizardry</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultima</span></i><span> were already several games deep by the mid 80s, and gamers in Japan could enjoy region-exclusive hits like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><span>Falcom</span></a><span>’s </span><i><span>Dragon Slayer</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>The Black Onyx</span></i><span> on PC about two years before </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> debuted. The real claim to fame of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> isn’t </span><i><span>inventing</span></i><span> the video game RPG, but distilling this mouse-and-keyboard genre into a form that could fit on the more mainstream Famicom. It’s objectively not the first Japanese RPG, but it is arguably the first “jRPG.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As a result, the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>boils down to an exceedingly simple loop: fight monsters, buy equipment, level up. If you cross a bridge and die to strong monsters, do something else to get stronger. Talk to townsfolk, gather hints to find key items, and eventually you will reach the final boss. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>hones in on a gradual power fantasy, one in which time invested translates directly into strength gained. These mechanics aren’t a result of the RPG genre freshly emerging out of its primordial goo. Rather, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a statement about RPGs as a whole—strip the genre to its most essential parts, and this is what you get.</span></p>

 <p><span>To this day, that loop of “do an activity, level up, repeat” that drives RPGs remains the basis of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-d4-loot-reborn-season-4-helltide-1851482897"><span>major video game franchises</span></a><span>. You can even find </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127000/Splintered/"><span>brand new games</span></a><span> that specifically iterate on the look and feel of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, simply because the core formula is still compelling. The remakes and remasters of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> have only homed in on that fundamental loop harder, with rebalanced EXP and Gold gains that get players to that sweet dopamine rush of leveling up even faster. The most recent mobile versions of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> even highlight the location of key items, nullifying that aforementioned element of hint gathering to get players back to grinding slimes and skeletons until they’re strong enough to overcome their next obstacle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ll be honest, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-games-where-to-start-guide-1851700491/5"><span>I’m a sucker for these iterations of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i></a><span>. It’s now a concise RPG that you can start after breakfast and finish before dinner, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre associated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>wildly long runtimes</span></a><span>. The game can feel tough, especially for kids who were expecting a </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>-like experience after getting it from </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15410710/dragon-quest-heroes-ii-square-enix-japan-us-release"><span>a Nintendo Power giveaway</span></a><span>. But once you learn the basic rules, I’d say </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is just as soothing as it is epic (by 1986 standards, anyway). Meanwhile, “soothing” is the last word I’d use to describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646279">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</em>: So are the worms</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> separates itself from its source material right after you select “new game.” Following a series of cutscenes that introduce a few major characters, the hero embarks on a quest that is not driven by accruing strength, but by traveling to set locations to advance the plot. This is now a story-driven game, and the story it tells is practically the antithesis of the original game’s loop. You are not a mighty warrior embarking on a power fantasy. You are alone in a world devoid of hope, where death and defeat are always a breath away.</span></p> <p><span>These feelings permeate the combat of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, battles are quick 1vs1 skirmishes in which your actions typically consist of attacking, casting a spell, or healing.” In </span><i><span>HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, the hero now faces full groups of enemies at once. This pushes you into the role of the wary tactician, perpetually one bad turn away from defeat. Battles are now drawn out affairs in which individual enemies can attack multiple times per turn as if to reinforce how heavily the deck is stacked against you. If an enemy scores a single critical hit on you, a game over is likely to soon follow.</span></p>  <p><span>To compensate, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>now lets you utilize a plethora of modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>spells and abilities. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, the hero learns ten spells in total. By the time I finished </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, the hero had forty-seven. Weapons and armor now boast unique properties, a far cry from the static stat increases of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Even in regular encounters, I found myself swapping my equipment nearly every turn to exploit weaknesses and optimize my elemental resistances. And </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-how-to-beat-lu-bu-chapter-2-1851765372"><span>lest you think I’m just doing hard mode things</span></a><span>, this is all on the default normal difficulty!</span></p>

 <p><span>The irony of these new battle mechanics is that they do feel retro-inspired, just not in a way that’s specifically faithful to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. There’s a heavy emphasis on dice rolls, where a single status effect landing on either side can single-handedly determine the outcome of combat. Missing an attack with a whip on a group of enemies feels crushing. Enemies spam instant death moves as frequently as they would in a proper full-party </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Were it not for this remake’s generous autosave system, dungeon exploration would probably feel tense in a way hardcore dungeon crawlers often do, but the cheery, inviting </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>series typically does not.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646281">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest</em> 0.2 – A Fragmentary Passage</b></h2> <p><span>You may be wondering how one could make a story-driven version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, a game that has virtually no story. The answer, of course, is to write an almost entirely new story that integrates the major beats of the NES classic. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is completely treated as a sequel to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>. Plot elements that only appeared in that third game now take the forefront here and completely recontextualize the story. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>originally spent a lot of time talking about the heroic deeds of the first Erdrick. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> proclaims that you </span><i><span>know </span></i><span>the first Erdrick, and it spends the entirety of its 15-hour run time acting as a bridge between </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In fulfilling this role, the tale of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> becomes somewhat darker than it has seemed in past incarnations. Princess Gwaelin, once the prototypical damsel-in-distress, is now blessed with powers, though they’re still insufficient against the villainous Dragonlord, costing the lives of her protectors before she is flung into a dungeon where she is psychologically tortured. At least one named character dies in a demon attack that feels as cruel as it is pointless. The soldiers who escape with their lives are broken by their helplessness, wondering what they can possibly do to defend against the powers that could target their loved ones next.</span></p> <p><span>Through these threads, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> focuses on one of the oldest themes in jRPG history: don’t give up hope. The solution for many of these struggles isn’t to go out and take on the world without aid; instead, people move forward by focusing on what they </span><i><span>can </span></i><span>do, which in turn creates the conditions for the hero to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“… You’re only one person. You can’t keep the whole world safe single-handedly,” a character tells the hero after her village wards off a deadly invasion. “We can’t give in to fear. If we run, then what happened to us will happen to others. The world won’t be safe. So we have to be strong. And we have to keep going.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This is where I feel </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> strains a bit in its identity as, well, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145759/masaaki-hayasaka-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-interview-gamescom"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>Shacknews</span></i></a><span>, remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka discusses how the team originally pitched series creator Yuji Horii on the idea of giving the hero more party members. However, according to Hayasaka, Horii was adamant that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>remain a solo adventure, stating “… </span><i><span>Dragon Quest 1</span></i><span> is a story about one man’s adventure, one journey, and it’s the history of the series.” This is a true statement about the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it is not true of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is very much </span><i><span>not </span></i><span>one man’s journey. It’s the story of people coming together to ward off a fearsome, overwhelming evil. It’s a celebration of small victories, like a father realizing that he can be a hero just by defending his family. It’s a game about a princess doing what she can to protect her kingdom, and it legitimately feels awkward that she doesn’t become a party member when she outright asks to join the hero. Frankly, more companions could have smoothed out some of the rough edges in this remake’s modernized combat system too, as it’s clearly designed for a full party.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’m not here to argue with Yuji Horii about a video game that he made in the 1980s. It’s just that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is not that game. I can’t state enough that I love the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and I sincerely recommend that you find the time to play any past iterations of the game if </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D </span></i><span>was your first exposure to it. Yet as I watched the credits roll, I found myself curious about the vision Hayasaka’s team had in mind when they pitched the idea of adding more party members. Could we have seen a deeper relationship blossom between the hero and Gwaelin outside the “love at first sight” premise of the original? Is there a world in which Robbin ‘ood could have worked as a playable character? I find these possibilities much more interesting than the idea that the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest must </span></i><span>be a solo journey, especially when virtually everything else about it has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That said, I’ll admit that limiting the game to one party member gives greater thematic significance to the second game in this package.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646282">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>After all my passion for the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, forgive me if I don’t sound as enthusiastic about </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>. I didn’t play it as a kid, and most of the western hemisphere seems to hold it in relatively low regard. </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142844/dragon-quest-games-ranked-list"><span>It routinely ranks at the bottom of mainline </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>rankings</span></a><span>, though these same rankings often clarify that the writers don’t outright hate the game. In my opinion, it’s missing the strong hook that would have made it distinct from the other mainline games. The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a less technically impressive game, but its simplicity gives it a lasting charm that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>lacks.</span></p> <p><span>One look at Japan in 1987, however, paints a very different picture. In </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112519/http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg"><span>an archived interview with </span><i><span>1Up</span></i></a><span>, Chunsoft founder Koichi Nakamura describes how he “was very confident that [the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>] was going to become a hit.” However, he was disappointed with how the first game initially sold, as he was “expecting it to be a bigger hit.” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was actually the breakout success that would eventually lead to the series spawning </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-spawned-an-urban-myth"><span>wild rumors about Japan declaring a holiday whenever a </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game is released</span></a><span>. According to Nakamura, “once [</span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>] was out in stores, it created a huge panic — the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>panic — everybody wanted </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and the stores all sold out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s fitting, as </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>introduces much of the flavor that would define </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>beyond “it’s kind of like </span><i><span>Ultima </span></i><span>I guess.” The player now commands a party that must contend with swarms of foes in strategic combat. The world is vast in scope, going so far as to include the island of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a small slice of its map. The journey spans multiple granular arcs that balance drama with whimsy. If the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is the core of the turn-based RPG, then </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>is the core of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a series.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>also released in a notably unfinished state. In </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/dragonquestii/"><span>a 1987 interview</span></a><span>, Yuji Horii describes how the development team had to scramble to balance the game, which ultimately delayed the game’s release. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was also designed with more elaborately drawn cutscenes in mind, but those had to be cut due to memory limitations. Items were wholesale removed from the game, leaving some treasure chests empty. Even the ending was cut down to size; Horii originally entertained the idea of having the Prince of Cannock sacrifice himself during the final battle, which would lead to the Princess of Cannock murdering the protagonist out of revenge for her lost brother. I don’t think that would have been a </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>idea, but it definitely is an idea!</span></p>

 <p><span>The point is, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>comes across as a game whose narrative ambitions outstripped what was feasible at the time. It’s been remade about as many times as the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, which has afforded its makers many opportunities to fix any lingering balance issues (ask your local NES gamer about </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/183zlyr/the_final_section_of_dragon_quest_2_is_making_me/"><span>what the final act of the game was like</span></a><span>). However, </span><a href="https://www.realmofdarkness.net/dq/snes-dq2-differences/"><span>aside from altering some dungeon layouts and introducing some extra stuff to interact with</span></a><span>, none of these remakes have punched up the content of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to better match that original vision. Keep in mind that its sequel, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>, received a massive overhaul</span> <span>when it was remade on the Super Famicom way back in 1996, with new items, core mechanics, and content that </span><a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_III/Versions"><span>would mostly carry forward to its subsequent remakes</span></a><span>. The precedent was there for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to get a glow up, but it never got one, until now.</span></p> <p><span>For this reason, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span> feels much more impressive than its predecessor in this package, even though the two games were treated virtually identically by Masaaki Hayasaka’s team. It too is very different from what it previously</span> <span>was, but it also feels closer in spirit to what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>has always aspired to be.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646283">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake</em>: Party like it’s 1999ish</b></h2> <p><span>As you might expect, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> is also now a story-driven game. While the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>mostly treated the player’s party as observers traversing through the world, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D </span></i><span>makes the protagonists active participants in the unfolding events. The characters now discuss events at length that passed in mere seconds in the original game, and we get our fair share of “you couldn’t sleep either?” conversations in which the cast can intimately discuss their feelings. It’s not quite a “modernized” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it does more closely match the jRPGs of the SNES and PSX eras, rather than the NES one.</span></p> <p><span>By focusing more on the main characters, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> builds off of that feeling of hopelessness that pervades so much of its predecessor. Back on the NES, the Princess of Moonbrooke occasionally felt like the little sister who you had to let follow you so your mom wouldn’t get mad. She contributes to combat, but her lack of defenses and low level cap could make her a liability. In </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, not only is she an invaluable party member, she’s practically the beating heart of the entire cast. Hers is the only kingdom to be destroyed by the villain Hargon’s forces, so her sorrow and desire for revenge give a weight to the conflict that never existed before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As the Prince of Cannock tells the protagonist, “The princess fights to exorcise the grief and anger that cloud her heart…We may never be able to soothe the Princess’s pain, nor replace her family, but perhaps we can offer her another.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> lingers on that sorrow for much of its early game, but something interesting happens as it progresses. In the original game, the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/PswoKohVx4Y?si=u8OBkuXwGhmUM656"><span>world map theme that plays at the start carries a melancholic tone</span></a><span>, riffing on the equivalent theme in the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. However, once the party of heroes is assembled, the theme changes to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPKbuxLwELs"><span>a happier, jaunty tune</span></a><span>, marking the moment as a sea change for the rest of the game. This remake’s narrative similarly shifts in tone as it progresses. That overwhelming darkness starts to feel surmountable in a way that wasn’t felt in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, and that theme of clinging to hope finally feels like it pays off.</span></p> <p><span>“But lately, I dream [of Moonbrooke’s destruction] no longer,” the Princess of Moonbrooke tells the protagonist later in their journey. “I dream instead of our time together. The meals we enjoy in one another’s company. The arguments. Even the battles. I once believed that the purpose of this journey was to see Hargon and his minions suffer as I have suffered. But I know now that this is not true. And I know this thanks to all of you.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646284">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The epic conclusion</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> isn’t just a <em>D</em></span><i><span>ragon Quest II </span></i><span>remake: it is the culmination of all the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span> games. The villain Hargon has been built up and teased for two games now. It feels as if evil forces are a generational inevitability that can only be subdued rather than outright defeated. For someone who is freshly experiencing the first three </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games via these remakes, it might feel like this is just what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is: Monsters endlessly returning time and again, like the villains of the week in an old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sentai"><span>Super Sentei</span></a><span> series.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> counterbalances this by showing how good works can become generational too. The heroes are regularly saved by relics of the past, like Princess Gwaelin’s pendant which both opens otherwise blocked paths and dispels enemy magics that confound the party. The legendary armaments crafted for the past Erdricks can also be found and used throughout this journey. The heroes of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> are younger than their heroic predecessors were when they faced generational evil, but the legacies of their ancestors give them the strength to do what couldn’t be done in the past: End this cycle once and for all.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>“It’s interesting to think that every generation between Erdrick and yourselves had its own heroes,” the party is told. “All those who came before you: your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents…All of them were heroes in their own right, if only because they kept Erdrick’s legend alive until you lot came along to repeat it.”</span></p> <p><span>This reframing of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> gives it a unique warmth in relation to the other HD-2D games. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span> technically has a party system, but it’s filled with generic mercenaries created by the player, so it still feels a bit lonely. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, as I described above, is a solo adventure despite this remake’s best efforts. So coming into </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, with its full party of developed characters, brings an end to those hours upon hours of isolation you feel by playing these games in this order.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646285">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Strength through unity</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> leans into this theme by adding the Princess of Cannock to the cast of playable characters for the first time in this game’s history. It’s a big departure from the original for sure, but given Yuji Horii’s original aspirations for the Princess to take a more prominent role, her inclusion feels appropriate. She doesn’t kill the protagonist (sorry, spoilers), but I think Horii would have agreed this direction is best even back in 1987. From a pure gameplay perspective, the Princess of Cannock is a major boon to the combat system. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>combat works best with a party of four, as this gives the player enough actions per turn to cast buffs and debuffs, and even to take a gamble on some status effects here and there.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Princess of Cannock also breathes new life into the party’s relationships with each other, offering fresh perspectives as the protagonists interact with the world. I can only describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> as overwhelmingly empathetic, with its heroes unifying the many peoples and species of the world with their kindness. Meanwhile, disorder notably divides the villains of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, with Hargon’s generals routinely sabotaging each other for personal gain. The Princess of Cannock mentions this outright, as it becomes a massive advantage the heroes can press over their enemies.</span></p> <p><span>“I am overjoyed! For I have seen that we can win!” the Princess of Cannock proclaims. “That victory over Hargon and his armies shall surely be ours! …There is no unity among the monsters. No harmony… Each is a law unto themselves. We, on the other hand, have made—and continue to make—allies of the people we meet.”</span></p> <p><span>These themes of hope may be new to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but they’re not new to RPGs. Notably, however, they have gone out of vogue in recent years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-are-giving-up-on-the-idea-that-we-can-save-1849727976"><span>As Michael Lee writes in his reflection on this very topic</span></a><span>, “The question video game narratives are asking has shifted from ‘How can we save the world?’ to ‘How do we live in the world we couldn’t save?’” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake</span></i><span> is modernized, but not so modernized to age itself out of this classic theme. The way it homes in on this concept makes it feel like an homage to the entire RPG genre as it evolved following the original release of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>back in 1987, and that story is exactly what we need in the present day.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646293"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646293">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The real <em>Dragon Quest</em> was inside you all along</b></h2> <p><span>Neither game in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is profound in ways I’ve never seen before. I can point to games with better stories, better battle systems, games that are better at whatever criteria we use to discuss a game’s quality. Yet I found myself regularly tearing up playing these games, even during banal moments that shouldn’t elicit an emotional reaction. These games aren’t facsimiles of what they were before. But as I interrogated that deep response I was routinely getting, I realized that’s the essence of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest—</span></i><span>simple, poetic adventures that give us the space to slow down and reflect on our lives, taking whichever shape will reach us in the moment.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>invites us not to look at this series as a set collection of rules and systems, but as classics that </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>speak to whichever time period they’re revisited in. After all, while the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is a great tutorial for how RPGs work, the modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>fan doesn’t necessarily need one of those. Homer’s </span><i><span>The Odyssey </span></i><span>probably wasn’t created to be forever discussed in academic settings. But whether it takes the form of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F"><span>the tale of escaped convicts in 1937 Mississippi</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic:_The_Musical"><span>a series of musical numbers that are covered and animated by internet denizens</span></a><span>, the story continues to resonate throughout society. Were </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>a fully modernized, 3D reimagining, we’d probably look at it as a new game totally detached from what it was before. But it maintains just enough of a retro sensibility to bring RPG fans back to the halcyon days of their youth, even if the core essence of these games has drastically shifted.</span></p> <p><span>As Tim Rogers says in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-xi-the-kotaku-review-1828646512"><span>his very in-depth and very good review of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI</span></i></a><span>, “</span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games are bedtime stories.” I don’t think I’m the only one for whom calming my ever-present anxiety enough to get eight actual hours of sleep has been a struggle for these past couple of years. There have been so many layoffs in the video game industry that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs"><span>it got its own tag on this very website</span></a><span>. The cost of living is unconscionably high. My own career as a writer has been completely and utterly slashed to unrecognizable shreds thanks to </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs/"><span>shortsighted media networks</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/04/14/the-60-problem---how-ai-search-is-draining-your-traffic/"><span>AI-driven algorithm changes</span></a><span>. How can someone dream of a joyful future when just surviving for the next six months is an overwhelming prospect? Where does one find the energy to take another step forward in a world that seems to detest their existence?</span></p> <p><span>In this mindset, it’s all too tempting to retreat into nostalgia, living in a fantasy of “the good old days” as our bodies age and our minds wither away. And for the RPG enjoyer, there is no more reliable comfort food in such times than </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. I find it moving to think that those most in need of the hope these games offer may come to them seeking to blot out the world by retreating into the nostalgic comfort they offer and perhaps instead find the courage to face the darkness enveloping their lives. A world in anguish is a world that can be united. Evil is not an inevitability that has to endlessly repeat. Maybe we aren’t Erdricks, but rather, we’re the people simply enduring, searching for our own small destinies as we bolster our heroes. The sun will rise again no matter how endless the night may feel, and it will be because the suffering that connects us is greater than the philosophies that divide us. Those who oppress us are too disordered and too selfish to overcome a force as powerful as that.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is the bedtime story for the broken. It’s comfort for those who desperately need to find their strength again, a reminder that it’s okay to dream of a world where we’re surrounded by friends and we fight for a brighter future. What we get here is not </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, nor is it </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but its connection to the original form of those games is not arbitrary. Rather, through this reinvention, I once again remember the promise expressed by the gameplay loop of the very first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>: Take your time and get stronger. Know when to fight another day if you encounter a challenge you cannot overcome. Talk to those around you. Gather hints and follow the clues. The road ahead may be fraught, and you may face defeat. But always remember the time you’ve invested is not wasted. Fight bravely and do not back down. Persevere, and you will finally win.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-hd2d-remake-review-is-it-good-2000646277]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Honkai: Star Rail</span></i><span> publisher HoYoverse’s next game seems to be less fantasy or sci-fi than psychological thriller—something more akin to Remedy Entertainment’s </span><i><span>Control</span></i><span> than Nintendo’s </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, which </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was compared to when it was first released. Clearly a horror game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> begins with a job application that may cause “slight discomfort.”</span></p> <p><span>HoYoverse announced the game on Thursday with a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NccLyRQQZY"><span>31-minute gameplay demo</span></a><span> showing the world of </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>, in which the player-character approaches a desk to join a mysterious organization called SEAL (Shadow Emergency Alliance) whose headquarters looks to be a government building that shifts and changes due to “disruption events” caused by mindrot. The gameplay demo has about 20 minutes in the SEAL building, followed by a lengthy driving segment before heading out into the field where the player battles shadowy monsters while dressed like Harley Quinn.</span></p>

  <p><span>“Upon entering Varsapura, the protagonist’s appearance shifts to match each viewer’s preferences,” HoYoverse wrote in the YouTube video’s description, perhaps explaining the outfit shift from sexy cop to DC villian-lookalike. “The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> is also HoYoverse’s first game using Unreal Engine 5; </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was made in Unity. The game shares a similar vibe for its characters but the broader art direction is definitely more moody and distinct. HoYoverse’s usual cel-shaded look has been swapped for more realistic, three-dimensional textures—the characters and design look more similar to the company’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833000/N0va_Desktop/"><span>Lumi character model from its desktop companion program Nova Desktop</span></a><span> than any of its previous games.</span></p> <p><span>There’s no information yet on its timeline for release. As of now, HoYoverse has three unreleased games in development: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima"><i><span>Honkai Nexus Anima,</span></i><span> a creature-collecting game</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/petit-planet"><i><span>Petit Planet</span></i><span>, a life simulator</span></a><span>; and the newly announced </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>. Beyond announcing the game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>‘s lengthy gameplay demo seems to be an ad to recruit developers: The video ends with all the different jobs HoYoverse is hiring for.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“</span><span>Hoyo literally said, ‘go get a job’ by a game,” one person joked on Instagram. </span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uk-unveils-%E2%80%98military-esports-games%E2%80%99-in-alliance-with-40-countries.1361272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, the International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) was unveiled in the United Kingdom. The initiative, which brings together ’40 allied nations’, endeavours to ‘sharpen the cyber skills that are critical for modern warfare’. This news comes mere months after the United Kingdom’s government moved to recognize esports as a ‘military sport’.</p>



<p>In a press release from the UK government, it was said that IDEG26, the inaugural tournament in the ecosystem, will take place next year and has been partially inspired by Ukrainian forces using drone simulator games to train operators in the field.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-the-battlefield-to-potentially-battlefield">From The Battlefield to (Potentially) <em><span>Battlefield</span></em></h2>



<p>It hasn’t yet been confirmed which games will serve as the foundation of the IDEG’s esports initiative, but it’s safe to assume it’ll be militaristic shooters, given the link.</p>



<p>Battlefield just got into the esports arena with a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-elite-series-announced-with-1-million-prize-pot/">$1 million REDSEC tournament</a>, so perhaps that could serve as a staging ground.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-military-esports-games-to-boost-cyber-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by the UK government, the Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Strategic Defence Review has shown us clearly that the nature of war is changing, and we must change with it. The Government’s Plan for Change demands forces are ready for digital battlegrounds, where our personnel must be as skilled in cybersecurity and with controllers as they are in traditional combat.</p>



<p>Lessons from Ukraine have shown how gaming technology can train drone operators and develop the rapid decision-making skills essential for modern warfare. The International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) positions Britain at the forefront of this transformation, ensuring our armed forces are prepared for the conflicts of tomorrow.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, the Deputy Commander of Cyber and Specialist Operations Command said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The International Defence Esports Games represent a significant step forward in developing the cyber and digital skills essential for modern military operations. Lessons from conflicts including Ukraine have demonstrated the real-world value of gaming technology in training drone operators and enhancing cyber capabilities.</p>



<p>IDEG will strengthen our warfighting readiness whilst building crucial partnerships with allied nations who share our commitment to technological innovation in defence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2026, the first IDEG tournament will surface, taking place at the National Gaming and Esports Arena in Sunderland. As a hybrid event, it’ll also feature a cybersecurity, AI, and drone operations summit.</p>



<p>Do you think there are any concerns with this kind of vertical crossover? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hear me out: <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t a racing game, it’s an art tool with a racing game tacked on.</p><p>The game, out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, is the follow-up to the quirky Kirby-flavored kart racer released in 2003 on the GameCube. It features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch"><em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai</a>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo">round, pink, utterly charming</a> child participating in short races where the main feature isn’t so much about how fast you go, but how well you can manage the winding courses while fighting the cutest rogues’ gallery ever committed to polygons.</p><p>Unlike in other kart racers, <em>Air Riders</em> has no acceleration button. Instead you’re automatically propelled forward, requiring you to negotiate the track with the brake button that you can use to drift around corners. You can also use the brake to charge your kart (known as a “machine”) for an extra boost of speed at the expense of halting all forward momentum while you charge up.</p><p>To add another interesting wrinkle, <em>Air Riders </em>is stuffed with different kinds of machines with different properties. Those properties are not the kind of acceleration, braking, and handling stats that are common in, say, <em>Mario Kart</em>, but fundamentally change how the machine handles. The Swerve Star, for example, is super fast but can only change its direction while charging. As a result, it can’t gently glide along curves and turns, but instead ricochets across a course like a pinball. Meanwhile, the Bulk Star won’t accelerate if it’s not charged, but it makes up for the constant starting and stopping by being super fast and super tanky. In <em>Air Riders</em>, the machines have just as much personality as the racers, which brings me to my strange little declaration.</p><p>I haven’t done much racing in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> because I don’t wanna leave the damn vehicle customization screen. I was not expecting this cute little mashup of Sakurai’s pet projects — <em>Smash Bros.</em> and <em>Kirby</em> — to have such robust customization options, and it has completely dominated my time with it. More than just changing machine colors and adding the odd sticker, you can add different patterns and textures to your machine, both on the body and the boosters. There are different visual effects you can add to the trail your machine leaves in its wake. You can customize your Rider Cards that you show off while you race online with titles, backgrounds, pictures, borders, and more. Even the act of applying the cosmetics has an unexpected level of detail to it, allowing you to rotate, transform, and flip patterns and decals with fine precision to get anything you want in the right place just so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Just an example of some of some of the things creators have done with machine customization.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>And if that weren’t enough, there’s also an online shop where players can upload their own creations that other players can buy. Better yet, it’s all done with currency earned in-game, which is refreshing when this kind of cosmetic expression is typically locked behind <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/have-live-service-games-gone-off-the-deep-end-with-insultingly-expensive-cosmetics/">microtransactions</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">gacha-game-like chance</a>. Naturally, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-bikini-chef-kawasaki-custom-vehicle-2000646175">there have been issues,</a> but <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-custom-vehicle-designs-market-best-2000645836">the level of creativity</a> on display there speaks to just how incredible these customization features are.</p><p>I. Am. Obsessed.</p><p>After a couple of introductory races, I blew my entire stack of currency buying up stuff just to play with the customization tools. In fact, the only reason I race at all is to earn enough currency to go back, buy up more stuff, and play with them some more. I know I’m playing <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>incorrectly — but I’m having too much fun to care.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826488/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-vehicle-customization]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-sims-pirate-vanishes-leaving-sadness-and-controversy-behind.1361248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game piracy, the common and controversial practice of copying and sharing games without paying for them, has its advocates. One of them was Anadius, a popular fixture in the <i>Sims</i> community for his “<i>Sim 4</i> Updater” tool which allowed users to pirate the game’s many expansions. I say “was,” because the fellow has gone dark, and in his wake, all that’s left is disappointment and disagreement over the state of the work he’s left behind.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All done! Have fun playing the game! 🙂</p> <p>— anadius (@anadius) <a href="https://twitter.com/anadius/status/1991539527018557494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I decided to step down,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/1p28a9o/comment/npveo2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Anadius said</a> before pulling a Bilbo Baggins (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4-legend-behind-piracy-tool-rendering-nearly-usd1-500-of-dlc-totally-free-quits-town-and-takes-his-loot-with-em-players-pay-tribute-as-copycats-immediately-try-to-charge-for-alternatives/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). “Don’t pester my close friends, till the end I acted like an asshole I am and haven’t told them the reason why either.” His departure has sent shockwaves through the r/PiratedGames community and those who relied on his tools to play <i>The Sims 4</i>. But he didn’t take all of his toys with him; he left behind the source code for his work, enabling others to pick up the pieces and continue to sail the seven seas. Someone has already stepped in to do just that. Problem is, she’s locked these pirate tools up behind a paywall via Patreon.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simmerella has shared the news on Patreon (free) that they'll be working on a *NEW* updater, and have been given all requireed files to make that happen.</p> <p>See their announcement below:<a href="https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ">https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ</a></p> <p>— GewoonIraj (@xLOLxLOLxIRAJx) <a href="https://twitter.com/xLOLxLOLxIRAJx/status/1991842574290583784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Popular <i>Sims 4</i> modder Simmerella took over Anadius’ work. But while some pirate communities are okay with paying a certain amount of money for access to troves of pirated material, this segment of the <i>Sims </i>community isn’t too thrilled, especially considering the fact that <a href="https://x.com/impekko/status/1991922291018698781?s=20">Anadius didn’t charge for his work</a>.</p> <p>There’s another potential wrinkle in all of this: the fact that Simmerella is using a popular funding platform to more or less sell piracy services. As <i>Sims</i> creator <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1991888537718018510?s=20">SimMattically put it</a> in an X thread documenting the community reaction to the news, “you have to put your legal name and pay taxes on your Patreon earnings lmfao bless [Simmerella] and good luck.”</p>

                <p>During an investor presentation earlier today, Ubisoft showed off Teammates, a new R&amp;D game experience that utilizes generative AI. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also described the advent of generative AI in games as "a revolution."</p><p>"Generative AI is as big a revolution for games as the shift to 3D," said Guillemot (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results%20%20as%20the%20tech%20is%20embraced%20company%20wide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>). "We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams... It's as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front."</p><p>Teammates was developed by the team behind Neo NPC. The company also said that the demo is meant to prove that "generative AI-driven gameplay can shape a new generation of more interactive and engaging games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608845" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608845"></a><figcaption>A screencap from Teammates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg"></figure><p>The game's prototype is currently being tested by a small number of players. Teammates is a first-person shooter, but its AI tools will supposedly let it adapt to voice commands from the player, allowing NPCs to dynamically respond in real-time.</p><p>"It's really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories," said the game's narrative director, Virginie Mosser. "Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativize it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability."</p><p>Teammates includes a companion character called Jaspar who is said to be able to help the player overcome obstacles and provide hints or strategies. In concept, that's not very different from other NPCs in numerous games. What supposedly makes Jaspar stand out is his ability to interact and respond directly to the player.</p><p>The Teammates devs note that it has a specially made Application Programming Interface (API) that can utilize guardrails that shield players from AI-powered hallucinations and "helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play." The company also characterized Teammates as an experiment that "serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology."</p><p>Ubisoft has stated that its new "Creative Houses" operating model will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-posts-strong-first-half-growth-and-teases-major-creative-shake-up-coming-in-2026/1100-6536414/" data-ref-id="1100-6536414">unveiled in January 2026</a>. Earlier this week, Ubisoft apologized to players for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/" data-ref-id="1100-6536293">including AI artwork in Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>. The replacement image looks like the AI version, minus a few people with extra fingers or distorted faces.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In my freshman year of college, a friend of mine convinced me to go to Saint Mark’s and impulse <a href="https://videogamesnewyork.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">buy an imported PSP</a> before it had launched in the States. This was generally bad financial advice, as it blew a gargantuan hole in what little disposable income I had at the time. But buying it felt fantastic, one of the first real things I had purchased as an adult who could vote, smoke, die in a war, but not yet legally drink. We then proceeded to go around the corner to a dingy and poorly lit Italian restaurant and played each other in the only game we had at the time, <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmnMAzPx7jU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Lumines Soundtrack: SHININ'"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>SHININ'...my old friend.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t remember the meal, but I do remember the walls melting away and both of us being locked in silent combat for much of the duration of our time there. From that moment onward, the PSP became ”the machine that played <em>Lumines</em>.” <em>Lumines</em> came to represent that feeling of PlayStation  cool – the idea that video games were these things that young, fashionable adults in urban areas played, like the scene in <em>Hackers</em> where they go to the club and play a pre-vis version of <em>Wipeout</em> on a wall of CRTs. It was also a game that represented what rhythm games can and should be, a sublime melding of music and play, of performance and curation. Now, decades later, <em>Lumines Arise </em>returns when much of that feeling of gaming’s potential for being cool is largely absent. <em>Lumines Arise </em>is that feeling of 2000s cool unthawed, along with all it represented.</p><p>The original <em>Lumines </em>was the product of Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the man who introduced a generation of indoor internet kids to the concept of synesthesia with the game <em>Rez</em>. The player drops various configurations of 2x2 blocks in various configurations of two patterns, while a metronome line sweeps the stage. When the line sweeps through a solid color square, the square is eliminated. What differentiates <em>Lumines</em> from many other puzzle games is that it makes explicit the implicit rhythm and tonality of the format with different speeds and custom music. A stage in <em>Lumines </em>is bespoke, with everything synchronizing and pulses in perfect harmony.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-TLvgz8mXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Star Guitar by The Chemical Brothers | Lumines II"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>I kinda love that they just used the Michel Gondry video as the backdrop for this.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It has been well over a decade since we have gotten a <em>Lumines</em> game that was not some flavor of remake. In the void of new releases, Q Entertainment and subsequently Enhance (the company Mizuguchi would go on to found in 2014) went on to riff on similar puzzle-rhythm fusion concepts, the most notable recent release being <em>Tetris Effect. Tetris Effect </em>was a <em>Lumines</em>-themed mutant, with its immersive music and textural themes infecting the most storied and beloved puzzle series in history. But <em>Tetris Effect</em> always had to be a <em>Tetris</em> game first and foremost, a quality that confined what it could do as a synesthetic experience, and on some level it felt like a dry run for the inevitability of <em>Lumines Arise</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I can confirm that this looks sick in VR. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>To play <em>Lumines Arise</em> actively is to give the whole of your being to sound and form. The textures of individual tile dyads shift between stages; on one stage they take the shape of jarringly vivid fruits and vegetables, on another they are droplets of water and jellyfish. The dropping, clearing and twisting of each block sync harmoniously with the song in the background, one stage in particular being flanked by giant raving chameleons.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Burst mechanic is new and gives you breathing room to create a single, giant block. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sets of stages in <em>Lumines</em> blend in with one another like an album or a DJ set. Like<em> Tetris Effect </em>before it, it is one of the better showcases for VR as a format, as the immersion of being fully swaddled in a space and surrounded by whirling particles gels perfectly with the game’s thesis of synesthesia and connection. You are meant to be locked in, senses blending in seamlessly with one another. But while the boutique VR experience that I dusted off my Valve Index for was nice, <em>Arise</em> is also a fantastic fit for portable gaming. It now has a permanent home on my Steam Deck in much the same way my PSP always had <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion.</em></p><figure><figcaption><span>Transitions between stages are shifting and intricate. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are times where the sheer noise of the default blocks can be a bit overwhelming. This is especially noticeable if you compare <em>Arise</em> to the original PSP classic, a game whose tiles were fairly clean and legible, steeped in the exact Y2K design sensibility you’d expect from a PSP puzzle game in 2004. That said, <em>Arise</em> also has a solid accessibility menu, allowing you to dial in the experience to fit different forms of color blindness and reduce the severity of particles. There are also spider and snake filters, which is a nice inclusion because I’m sure those levels in particular would be mildly terrifying to me if I had that phobia.</p><p>The music selection is apropos in <em>Arise</em>, a lot of bumping techno and a bunch of pop tracks crossing a variety of genres. The electronic music in these games is more strongly curated, and there’s at least one hip hop track in Event 7 that I just straight up don’t like. If I was more jaded I would say a few of the vocal tracks are corny, but I am old enough to also find them charming. They also contain a wisp of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/amazingthew.bsky.social/post/3m5ju6dzho22c?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">earnestness</a> that is fundamental to the game’s premise of connection and that is inseparable from the mentality that this game is culturally downstream of.</p><figure><figcaption><span> Later stages can get hectic. Credit: Enhance </span></figcaption></figure><p>It is that commitment to earnestness that I find so refreshing. I do not need to explain to you how cynical the world is. Art these days feels self-aware and too clever by half, unable to let its guard down to say something from the heart. <em>Lumines Arise</em> feels unstuck in time, like a memory of a dinner with an old friend when you were younger and more naive, when the future stretched out infinitely, before you were crushed by the weight of just getting by. It<em> </em>is a reminder that the beauty of the world is still limitless and luminous, that even something as abstract and frivolous as a puzzle game can stir in you emotions that are wordless and perhaps divine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-is-going-nuts-990-pro-2tb-ssd-going-for-pennies-when-you-buy-on-amazon-2000646246</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-going-nuts-990-pro-2tb-ssd-going-for-pennies-when-you-buy-on-amazon.1361218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is the <strong>best-seller among internal SSDs on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and that makes total sense given what you’re getting. Storage speed is the single greatest determinant of whether your computer feels snappy or sluggish, as fast SSDs eliminate boot delays, application loading, and file transfer bottlenecks. This drive delivers flagship performance at pricing that makes it the best value proposition in the SSD market right now. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">has it down to $169 for Black Friday, down from $229</a>, which marks a record low that places professional-grade storage well within reach of anyone building or upgrading a PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>7,450 MB/s Read Speed Eliminates Storage Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The s<strong>equential read speed of 7,450 MB/s</strong> represents the ceiling of what PCIe Gen 4 technology can do. You boot Windows in under 10 seconds, fire up applications in an instant, and transfer large files between drives in a matter of seconds-not minutes. In-game loading, when the game is loaded on this drive, is faster than on SATA SSDs or hard drives, with some titles eliminating loading screens altogether through DirectStorage support. It makes a big difference in day-to-day use, where everything from opening folders to extracting compressed files happens faster than you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential write speeds reach 6,900 MB/s</strong> to handle large file creation and modification with ease. For video editors working with 4K or 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains smooth, while render times significantly decrease. Content creators exporting large projects onto this drive find transfers complete in a fraction of the time that SATA drives normally would take.</p>



<p>The 2TB capacity allows for installing your OS, applications, and a substantial game library without relying on secondary storage. Modern games take up 50-150GB each, and with this capacity, you can store 15-40 titles depending on how large the files are. You keep the most played games installed and ready, instead of always having to reinstall and uninstall based on which one you want to play.</p>
<p>To achieve these speeds, the PCIe Gen 4 interface uses four lanes of bandwidth on compatible motherboards. The M.2 2280 form factor fits into the standard slots on modern motherboards without the need for adapters or special mounting hardware. This drive will work in older systems that have PCIe Gen 3 slots but will run at reduced speeds limited by that interface. Most motherboards from the past five years support PCIe Gen 4, making this drive compatible with the majority of current builds.</p>



<p>The <strong>thermal solution involves a heat spreader</strong> that radiates the heat during continuous operation. High-speed SSDs generate thermal energy during continuous intensive read and write operations, and proper cooling keeps performance within limits. The included spreader does its work quite effectively in most scenarios, but it’s even better with systems that have dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions. The drive implements thermal throttling, which drops the speeds temporarily when temperatures exceed safe limits, ensuring hardware protection while continuing operation.</p>
<p>Drive management tools such as performance optimization, firmware updates, and health monitoring are available through<em> Samsung Magician</em> software. You manage remaining drive life, securely erase data, and optimize settings for different workloads. The software normally runs in the background, usually alerting you to firmware updates or potential issues before they can become a problem.</p>
<p>At $169, you get Samsung’s flagship SSD with PCIe Gen 4 speeds for 26% off, dropping pro performance down to the mid-range drive price class.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Full screen capabilities for playing Xbox on PC has been added to Windows 11. Furthermore, it’s available to all Windows Insiders with the latest preview.</p>







<p>These days, like the marketing says, everything is an Xbox. Many of the exclusives Microsoft has racked up, like Halo, Gears of War, and Forza make their way to PCs in many forms. Plus, with Game Pass Ultimate having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-game-pass-40-new-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Game Pass</a>, you can easily play any game with a simple tap. However, even with playing on PC, it never felt like a replacement for the seamless console experience. Well, that’s about to change with the latest update for Windows 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-screen-for-xbox-on-pc-available-to-windows-insiders-now-via-new-update">Full Screen for Xbox on PC Available to Windows Insiders Now via New Update</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/11/21/full-screen-experience-expands-to-more-windows-11-pc-form-factors-for-windows-insiders/?ocid=Platform_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_11.21.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog from Windows</a>, the team reveals that, along with Preview Build 26220.7271, <strong>Windows 11 is getting Full Screen support for Xbox</strong>. Now, you can easily switch between desktop and Xbox’s Full Screen Experience via the task bar or Win + Tab. When in full screen, your desktop will switch to the Xbox page and you can play any game without distractions. <strong>You can also have multiple open games at once and switch between them with your controller</strong>. </p>



<p>No date was given as to when everyone will get Full Screen for Xbox on Windows 11. Still, it is a pretty neat concept and one many people on the go will enjoy. If you don’t own Windows 11, there is the new ROG Xbox Ally, which brings your Xbox to a portable device. Now, with other games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved going to PS5</a>, you can pretty much play Xbox wherever and however you want.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-balance-pvp-tryhards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-devs-always-wanted-balanced-pvp-to-avoid-%E2%80%98tryhards%E2%80%99.1361212/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new documentary episode uploaded to showcase the origins of ARC Raiders, Embark Studios took a deep dive into where the game came from. It walks viewers through the original PvE title that saw players team up against enormous robotic enemies, to the extraction shooter with intense PvP mechanics that we know today.</p>



<p>It was revealed in one segment that the team at Embark wanted to balance PvP so perfectly that it would placate players who didn’t <strong>want </strong>to fight other users for fear of stumbling upon ‘tryhards’ who could defeat them in every engagement.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-was-very-different">ARC Raiders Was Very Different</h2>



<p>In the documentary uploaded on YouTube today, we get a glimpse behind the curtain at the development lifecycle of ARC Raiders, which unfolded over more than seven years. It started as a PvE-exclusive game that would see players team up to take down extremely threatening ARC enemies, and it evolved into a PvPvE extraction shooter out of necessity and to become more marketable.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Evolution of ARC Raiders EP1 - Finding ARC Raiders" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdorU3sjt_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In one segment of the documentary, David Dixon, Embark Studios’ Animation Director, explained how PvP was addressed to ensure that <strong>all comers </strong>could have as much fun as possible, even when fighting tougher opponents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s why PvP is such an important addition to the game. A lot people have a strong reaction to what that might mean, but if you think about what happens when you play against other humans, you just realize that the finite distance gets closer to infinite, because now you have all the permutations of human behaviour in the session.</p>



<p>Some players might not like playing another person because they’ll get tryhards that are very, very good, but if we do our job well, then you’ll have something that feels balanced and fun, even if you’re not the best at aiming or the best at shooting.</p>



<p>You should still be able to find something rewarding in that experience of extracting stuff back out of the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When ARC Raiders hit the market, it felt like a positive and refreshing title that had everyone collaborating to explore this new world. Within a matter of days, the PvP theme had spiked, and every engagement felt heated and ‘on sight’. There are still positive interactions to be found, but as players became more capable and better equipped, the collaborative aspect mostly went out the window.</p>



<p>But fans accept that’s part of the PvPvE loop. It’s still not as bad as games like Escape from Tarkov, in which you have almost no chance whatsoever of collaborating with other random players.</p>



<p>Do you think ARC Raiders has good PvE, or is there something you’d change? Let your thoughts be heard on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/" data-ref-id="1100-6536356">new version of Nuketown arrived on November 20</a>, and one of the first things people tried on it was shooting off all the mannequin heads to unlock the long-running Nuketown Easter egg. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Black Ops 7, at least not yet. This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either.</p><p>A popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away. People are theorizing that the new version of Nuketown does indeed carry forward the Easter egg that's been in every version of Nuketown since 2010, but it's just not active yet.</p><p>In Black Ops 6, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-easter-egg-breathes-new-life-into-nuketown-in-the-creepiest-way-possible/1100-6527796/" data-ref-id="1100-6527796">zombified mannequins sprung forth from the ground</a> for the Easter egg. And <a href="https://screenrant.com/call-duty-black-ops-nuketown-easter-eggs-ranked/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as ScreenRant reminds us</a>, when Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown launched, it also didn't have the Easter egg unlocked, but it arrived around a week later. If the same pattern holds for Black Ops 7, fans can expect the latest version of the Easter egg to be here soon. Season 1 is expected to launch in early December, and this could be when the Easter egg gets unlocked for Black Ops 7, but that's just a guess.</p><p>The Nuketown Easter egg debuted with the first Black Ops game in 2010 and has showed up, in different forms, for every version of the map since. For the first game, shooting all the mannequin heads would trigger the game to start playing the Rolling Stones song "Sympathy for the Devil." In Black Ops 2, the Easter egg makes classic Activision games playable on an in-game sign.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch made <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame available to everyone</a> today, November 21. Before, players had to complete the campaign to unlock it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">is officially out if you haven't noticed</a>, and frankly, if you didn't, no one could blame you since this has felt like one of the most muted launches from Activision in years. Muted or not, however, it's still a new Call of Duty, which means that sales should already be skyrocketing, right? Well, at least right now, that doesn't seem to be the case. According to the latest weekly GSD Sales Data report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european">The Game Business,</a> while Black Ops 7 was at the top of the charts for the week of November 10-16, it's far behind last year's Black Ops 6 launch numbers, and far behind Battlefield 6's launch numbers for EU sales.</p>



<p>According to GSD Data, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's launch week sales in the EU fell short of Battlefield 6's first week EU launch sales by 63%, and according The Game Business's estimates, it fell short of last year's Black Ops 6 first week launch sales by over 50%. </p>



<p>So even though it still made it to the top of the sales charts for premium game sales in the EU for its launch week, which means it was able to sell quite a lot of copies, potentially in the millions, by Call of Duty standards, this launch missed the mark.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Anno 117: Pax Romana, which launched just two days ahead of Black Ops 7, and, according to The Game Business, more than doubled the launch numbers for the last major Anno game, Anno 1800.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 remains in the top-10 list for revenue earned, though it dropped from the copies sold list. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">it had an incredibly impressive first week</a>, it seems that the game's technical issues at launch and the poor word of mouth around that are impacting its sales.</p>



<p>And speaking of Battlefield 6, it remains in both the revenue top 10 and copies sold top 10. It's behind fellow EA title EA Sports FC 26 in both lists, but it is still in the top five. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is another title that was able to keep its spot in the top 10 for both the revenue earned and copies sold list as it continues to ride the wave of momentum from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">the release of its third and final DLC, lined up alongside a free trial weekend and major discount to the game on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Per The Game Business, here's the list of the top 10 games in the EU by copies sold for the week of November 10-16:</p>



<ol>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
</ol>

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Deals on Sony’s PlayStation 5 are much more common than those on its <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong>, the handheld that can remotely stream games from the console via Wi-Fi. But for Black Friday, the Portal just got its first major discount to around $178.99 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-Portal-Remote-Player-for-PS5-Console%2F5060699568" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-playstation-portal-remote-player-midnight-black%2FJXHQ3C2H3K%2Fsku%2F6614840" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Additionally, you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/824326">save up to $100</a> on every configuration of the PlayStation 5, including the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p>The PlayStation Portal launched to relatively tepid reviews back in 2023, with <em>The Verge</em>’s Antonio G. Di Benedetto ultimately concluding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">device is flawed, but fun</a> if you have fast internet. However, Sony has made strides to improve the experience over recent months, highlighted by a recent update that adds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814078/playstation-portal-ps5-cloud-streaming">cloud streaming</a>. The feature allows PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PlayStation 5 games, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Astro Bot</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, directly from the cloud instead of from their consoles over Wi-Fi. Additionally, PlayStation Portal users can stream select titles from their own library without needing to connect to their PS5 console.</p><p>In terms of hardware, the PlayStation Portal is essentially a standard DualSense controller split in half with a crisp eight-inch 1080p display in the middle. It supports DualSense haptics, too, so you get the full experience of the adaptive triggers and tilt controls in games that support the features. It’s great for playing PS5 games around the house; however, the overall experience is dependent on the quality of your Wi-Fi. If you plan to stream games from your PS5, we highly recommend connecting the console to ethernet.</p><p>While Sony has improved the overall experience of the PlayStation Portal, it still has some notable limitations. For instance, it only supports the wireless Pulse Explore earbuds and Pulse Elite headset. That means you can’t just connect any Bluetooth headphones you have lying around. It does, however, feature a 3.5mm headphone jack, allowing you to easily connect wired headphones.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/825985/sony-playstation-portal-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday-2000646239</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flagship iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones rule the premium space, but OnePlus challenges both with specs that match, if not outpace, most of their offerings at significantly lower costs. OnePlus 13 has a real shot at going head-to-head with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25 and offers flagship performance without that flagship price tag.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/">dropped the 256GB model to $699 for Black Friday, down from its usual $899</a>, which is <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this Samsung and Apple rival affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s high-end chipset, fabricated on a 3nm node</strong>. It strikes an excellent balance between high performance and energy efficiency. It handles demanding tasks from 4K video editing to high-end gaming without any thermal throttling or slowdown. Benchmarks peg it above Apple’s A18 Pro in multi-core operations and somewhere around Apple in single-core tasks. In reality, apps open instantly, multitasking remains fluid even with several dozen apps open, and games run smoothly at the highest settings available with stable frame rates.</p>
<p>The 12GB RAM makes sure everything runs smoothly from casual use to pro workflows. You can switch between apps without reloading them, keep extensive browser sessions running, and open demanding apps together with no performance degradation. This amount of RAM is more than what the majority of its competitors offer in this price bracket, not to mention that Samsung demands a much higher price for the same amount of RAM in its S25 series.</p>



<p>The <strong>80W SUPERVOOC fast charging</strong> fills the battery from empty to full in about 30 minutes, eliminating the anxiety of low battery during busy days. You plug in during a quick break and gain hours of usage. This is much faster than the iPhone 17’s 27W and Galaxy S25’s 45W, giving the OnePlus a substantial practical advantage. The 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging brings fast charging convenience without cables, matching what flagship phones typically offer through wired connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hasselblad camera partnership works with color science and image processing</strong> to ensure pictures appear natural instead of oversaturated social media-ready. The primary sensor takes vivid photos in bright daylight or challenging low-light situations. The camera system features ultrawide and telephoto lenses that maintain consistent quality across focal lengths. Hasselblad’s involvement shows in the nuanced color reproduction and dynamic range that gives photos a more refined look compared to typical Android processing.</p>



<p>The<strong> 6.82-inch AMOLED display features a refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> which smooths out scrolling and makes touches super responsive. The screen brightness goes as high as 4500 nits under very particular conditions, well enough that it’s readable in direct sunlight when other phones would wash out. It supports HDR10+ for better contrast while watching compatible video content.</p>
<p><strong>OxygenOS offers a clean Android experience (our favorite)</strong> with some very useful customizations that don’t bloat the interface. It also comes with three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches, keeping your phone current and secure. Additional features include game mode, parallel apps that allow running multiple accounts, and expansive gesture controls to enhance daily usability.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches a full day of heavy use</strong> with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. With the combination of efficient processor and large battery capacity, you are not hunting for chargers in the middle of the day. The phone handles heavy tasks such as navigation, video streaming, and gaming without frequent power management.</p>
<p>You get here flagship spec with Snapdragon 8 Elite and 80W charging at $699 which is $200 less than Samsung’s equivalent S25 and $300+ below the iPhone 17. Leading performance meets extremely fast charging and Hasselblad camera processing for true value that makes the traditional flagship pricing from Apple and Samsung increasingly hard to justify.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite the fact that many gamers seem to dislike or even outright hate AI-generated content in games, Ubisoft is pushing forward with it and now playtesting a shooter experiment built around AI-powered NPCs that can react to voice commands in real-time. Will it help the publisher regain some stability as it continues to struggle? I’m not sure. <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-live-in-hell-and-this-ubisoft-nft-that-requires-you-1848202326">All I can think about is the last time Ubisoft jumped on a tech fad with NFTs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game">On November 21,</a> after <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">a delayed earnings call</a>, Ubisoft revealed <em>Teammates</em>, which the company refers to as its “first playable generative AI research project.” Built in the Snowdrop Engine, the same tech that powers games like <em>The Division 2</em> and<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Teammates</em> is a first-person shooter that includes an AI assistant named Jaspar and two AI-powered squadmates called Pablo and Sofia. Players can command these two to help them solve puzzles or engage in combat using “natural” voice commands.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Jaspar can help track missions, offer advice, and provide guidance when needed.</p>

 <p><em>Teammates</em> is built by the same team behind <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">Ubisoft’s Neo NPCs</a>, which the company showed off in 2024 at GDC. The main goal of those AI-powered NPCs was to provide characters who can “dynamically” react to players in real-time, but within guidelines established by Ubisoft designers. The company said that it had guardrails in place to help stop the AI companions from hallucinating, being overly toxic, or going completely off script. But even Ubisoft admitted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-first-playable-generative-ai-experience-is-an-r-d-experiment-called-teammates-">in an interview with <em>Game Developer</em></a> that <em>Teammates</em> and its tech were still rough around the edges.</p>

 <p>In interviews about <em>Teammates</em>, Ubisoft tries to make the case that this tech won’t remove the human element from video game development. I find that hard to believe, considering that over the last two years or so, the studio has <a href="https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/ubisoft-layoffs">laid off over 600 employees</a> as it cuts costs and struggles to ship games people get excited about. I’m not sure NPCs that sort of listen to you when you tell them to do something is going to turn things around for Ubisoft, but it could potentially let them gut even more of the company while pivoting to AI moonshots at a time when the company’s future has never been more uncertain.</p>

 <p>“Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,”<a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/"> Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>And who even knows if Ubisoft will still be developing AI-powered content and tools in a few years? Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Ubisoft was all in on NFTs and the metaverse. Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-captain-laserhawk-the-game-nft-crypto-1851726108">Ubisoft technically hasn’t</a> completely <a href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe/status/1989025366669701411">given up on either</a>. But it’s pretty clear now that the company is moving on to AI as the next big thing that it hopes can convince investors that it is on the cutting edge of the future and deserving of more money, please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Oscar Isaac, star of Guillermo del Toro’s </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>film, signs a lot of autographs. Prior to his role as the titular doctor in del Toro’s take on the Gothic horror classic, he was Poe Dameron in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span>, Duke Leto Atreides in </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span>, and one of the alternate Spider-Men in</span><i><span> Across the Spider-Verse</span></i><span>. This man has been made into a Funko Pop several times over, and he clearly feels some type of way about them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He can probably spot an autograph reseller a mile away, too. That may be what happened when someone approached him outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles yesterday and asked him to sign some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395"><span>Funko Pops</span></a><span>, to which Isaac replied, “Nah, man, I’m not doing those Funkos.” </span></p>

 <p><span>The POV recording, from the perspective of the Funko Pop wielder, showed the stranger holding out a </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2099</span></i><span> Funko Pop after Isaac signs a </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>poster from the back of a truck, then stepping away, slightly dejected after the denial.</span></p>

 <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7574866863277100319" data-video-id="7574866863277100319" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?refer=embed">@eladiioenrrique</a>  <p>11/16/2025 – On Sunday, I got a last minute tip that Oscar Isaac was going to be at the Egyptian Theatre, (I know I told you this through DM but thank you again!), (you know who you are lol), so I tried to get him to sign my Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pops along with a Moon Knight Funko and a Spider-Man 2099 mini poster for my sister, of course in the video you only see the pops, but unfortunately Oscar stopped for the kid Grapher to sign Frankenstein items but he didn’t want to sign Marvel items. It was great to see him in person and honestly I don’t blame him at all, it was a long shot especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident but I was hoping he would sign the merch at least because imo he is still the most badass Miguel O’Hara and Moon Knight out there, he makes both characters, I’m sorry lol. I’m definitely going to get backlash for that lol. But anyways, thought I would share my interaction with him, and if Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster&nbsp;! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him. <a title="spiderman2099" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spiderman2099?refer=embed">#spiderman2099</a>  <a title="oscarisaac" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oscarisaac?refer=embed">#OscarIsaac</a>  <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed">#fyp</a>  <a title="disney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disney?refer=embed">#Disney</a>  <a title="frankenstein" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/frankenstein?refer=embed">#Frankenstein</a> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7574866731131292447?refer=embed">♬ original sound – eladiioenrrique</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>   <p><span>The Funko Pop collector, known as </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?lang=en"><span>EladiioEnrrique on TikTok</span></a><span>, alleged in the caption of his video that Isaac “didn’t want to sign Marvel items.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was a long shot, especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident,” he wrote, referring to Isaac’s recent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XciB_FC2fzs"><i><span>GQ</span></i><span> interview</span></a><span> in which he said he’d consider reprising his role as Poe in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> only “if they can kinda figure out [how], you know, not [to] succumb to fascism.” He was referring to ABC and Disney’s brief suspension of their late-night show host back in September after Jimmy Kimmel joked about the Trump administration’s reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s not clear if Isaac was refusing to sign Marvel merch specifically or if he was just refusing to sign Funko Pops in general, as they’re incredibly popular on the autograph reseller market. There are nearly 100,000 results for “signed Funko Pop” on eBay, with many of them going for a few hundred dollars. It’s now not uncommon for people like the owner of the aforementioned TikTok channel to follow celebrities around with several pieces of their respective merch in hand and ask for autographs, only to later try to flip them online for thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7570077334158511390?lang=en"><span>different video from EladiioEnrrique’s account</span></a><span> shows a horde of people waiting for pop star Miley Cyrus to sign autographs. One person has all of her vinyls taped together in a vertical stack, while another has several items hung from a hangar, all to make a mass-signing as quick and painless as possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most of EladiioEnrrique’s channel is just first-person POV videos of him getting celebrities to sign records, CDs, and, of course, Funko Pops. His latest video says that he got a “last-minute tip” that Isaac would be at the Egyptian Theater before rushing over to get the signatures. But he’s not a reseller. “I am a collector,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> via TikTok DM. “I don’t resell my signed items simply because I don’t see it as right.”</span></p> <p>“It’s definitely not my job, I know a lot of the graphers do actually do this for a living and go to eBay immediately to sell it,” he said when asked if he did this for a living. “I know this because I’ve seen their posts at times, but I can’t do it for a living, hell no.”</p> <p><span>After Isaac refused to sign his toys, EladiioEnrrique stepped away politely and wrote a very understanding but hopeful caption for his video.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“If Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in Marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him.” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>May all superfans be this well-adjusted.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new AI-driven research project from Ubisoft, called Teammates, has been revealed. The news comes after the company’s earnings call earlier today, which bolstered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong numbers for Assassin’s Creed: Mirage</a>.</p>







<p>AI in video games isn’t anything new, though the way it’s being used is. In the past, AI would play the role of NPCs, doing commands by code and filling the screen. Now, the process can replace art design, voice acting, and even entire games. Still, it does further exacerbates the lack of human touch to a project, which is never a good thing. Now, it seems Ubisoft is keen on getting in on the AI bubble with a new research project, aptly called Teammates.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-teammates-uses-an-ai-voice-assistant-self-programmable-npcs">Ubisoft’s Teammates Uses an AI Voice Assistant, Self-Programmable NPCs</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, as well as Twitter/X, Ubisoft shared a look at the AI-driven Teammates. While we don’t know how it’ll play, we do get some insight into the project. Framed as an FPS, Teammates has you and two AI NPCs go to an enemy base and save five members of your resistance. To aid you, you’ll have Jaspar, an AI voice assistant who provides tips on gameplay, story, and can tamper with settings with a simple voice command. </p>



<p>The blog goes a bit into detail on the gameplay and your AI NPCs, Pablo and Sofia. Via voice commands, you can tell them where to go, who to shoot, and build the narrative. Teammates’ Narrative Director, Virginie Mosser, spoke on the NPCs in the blog, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We hope players will feel like they’re shaping the story themselves, not just following it,</strong>” states Mosser. “<strong>When I talk to [my AI squad mate] Sofia, she reacts to what I tell her and it changes my experience. For me, this is a real breakthrough and allows players to experience the story in their own way.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of now, there are no plans to do anything with the public just yet. An explainer video is set to come soon, but no date as to when. Playtests did happen earlier this year and more will come soon. The team stresses throughout the piece that human creativity and ingenuity is at the heart of Teammates. Whether or not that statement is accurate does tip a bit to the side given the abundant usage of AI and chatbots. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Insider Gaming did release a story on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/">Project Scout</a>, an in-the-works multiplayer shooter at Ubisoft. From the looks of the screenshots and UI, Teammates could be the basis for the leaked title. Should Project Scout come to be, perhaps you’ll be fighting alongside programmable AI and not your friends.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6 clash was always going to be a fun narrative at the end of 2025. The player count for both games could determine their long-term success, and tell us which game is ‘winning.’</p>



<p>There’s a point to be made that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-names-battlefield-6-best-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> was going to have the edge with it being the first new release in several years. Then again, Call of Duty is a never-ending behemoth that continues to conquer the gaming world. The Black Ops 7 hype wasn’t great, but again, it’s Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Let’s break down their player count stats and see how each game is faring.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-battlefield-6">How Many People Are Playing Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big battle. Credit to EA and Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is currently averaging 150,000 to 200,000 players daily, almost two months after its launch.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Battlefield 6 hit a peak of <strong>747,440</strong> players (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>) early on. This is when the hype for the game was otherworldly. Games always drop off as time goes on, but retaining well over 150K players daily is impressive.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s 24-hour peak—on November 21—was <strong>215,985</strong>, showing how much the community is still invested in the shooter. Also, if you didn’t know, SteamDB is considered the leading metric for player counts on PC, and there’s no software to accurately track console data.</p>



<p>With Season 1 launching, following up the RedSec addition, there’s plenty for Battlefield 6 players to enjoy and look forward to. The game will likely get another huge player bump around Christmas as many are inevitably gifted the FPS for the holiday season.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 has broken franchise sales records</a>, and positive player count numbers will probably carry on.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-black-ops-7">How Many People Are Playing Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s much harder to track Black Ops 7’s player count data, but we know for a fact that it’s not averaging more than roughly 70,000 players daily, and this figure is likely far fewer.</strong></p>



<p>Individual CoD games are not tracked on SteamDB. Instead, it tracks ‘Call of Duty,’ and multiple CoD titles fall under this banner. This means that even though Steam shows a daily figure for Call of Duty, this is adding up several games: Black Ops 7, Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, etc.</p>



<p>On November 14—Black Ops 7’s launch—SteamDB reported a 24-hour peak of <strong>84,319</strong>. Don’t forget that this stat counts other recent Call of Duty games as well. Meaning the Black Ops 7 player count was probably closer to 70K or 60K at launch—maybe lower! </p>



<p>One week after launch, its 24-hour peak was already down to <strong>72,886</strong> players. Like Battlefield 6, the player count could easily rise over Christmas, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1</a> hasn’t launched yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-people-playing-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-more">Are People Playing Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 More?</h2>



<p><strong>Right now, people are declaratively playing Battlefield 6 more than Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>Using the data above, you can see that even with seven weeks extra on the clock, Battlefield likely has between two and four times the player base Black Ops 7 does on Steam. Figures could be different on PlayStation and Xbox, but with reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Sales Are Down 50% In Europe</a>, the story might be a similar one.</p>



<p>Are you playing Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6? Could this be a wake-up call for Activision? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is where you can let the world know your thoughts.</p>

                <p>Six years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> introduced Stranger Things' Eleven, Sheriff Hopper and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-fortnite-cosmetics-and-skins-now-a/1100-6468260/" data-ref-id="1100-6468260">portals to the Upside Down into the game</a>. With the fifth and final season starting on Netflix next week, Stranger Things is returning to Fornite with a new set of heroes crossing over.</p><p>Epic Games has revealed that Stranger Things' Mike, Dustin, Will, and Lucas are coming to Fortnite's Blitz Royale mode. Max, Steve, Nancy, Jonathan, and Robin apparently didn't make the cut. The artwork below features the Stranger Things kids--or perhaps young adults is more accurate now--with a backdrop revealing portals to the Upside Down across Hawkins and appearance by Vecna, the show's primary villain.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608723-fortnitestrangerthings2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608723" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608723-fortnitestrangerthings2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608723"></a><figcaption>The Stranger Things kids will get their own Fortnite skins very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608723-fortnitestrangerthings2.jpg"></figure><p>At least some of those Upside Down designs will be a part of the Stranger Things Fortnite Blitz Royale map and the Stranger Things skins will be released through the Fortnite store today. The older Stranger Things skins--Eleven, Jim Hopper, and a Demorgon--aren't currently available, but they seem like strong candidates to return.</p><p>Fortnite is still in its Simpsons mini-series mode until November 29.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Review - Strong Map Design Makes Multiplayer A Blast</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the patch notes, Treyarch says the studio "slightly overshot" its target balance, and a small tuning change is made to reduce this aim-assist penalty from 35% to 25%.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal for this new mechanic and our other aim-assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs," the developer says. "Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it's crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals."</p><p dir="ltr">To help provide better balance with Black Ops 7's assault rifles and submachine guns, Treyarch has included a damage range buff across all submachine guns in the game, and all of the assault rifles will feature slightly increased flinch.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just the beginning of the weapon tuning players can expect in the coming weeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the game's powerful Drone Pod field upgrade is now nerfed with the following changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The update includes Zombies changes meant to improve the main Ashes of the Damned Easter egg experience for all players, including adjustments to the difficulty of the boss fight. The boss fight's Hoard Husk will now regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health, and the boss's missile barrage has reduced effectiveness. It also reduces damage to passengers riding in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-zombies-how-to-repair-and-upgrade-ol-tessie/1100-6536336/" data-ref-id="1100-6536336">Ol' Tessie</a> and removes the repair cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">To improve the Zombies quest for solo players, Zursa the zombie bear will no longer spawn in solo boss fights before round 100 and will have reduced speed.</p><p dir="ltr">This new update also unlocks the campaign's Endgame mode for all Black Ops 7 players to enjoy. Those who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">variety of Black Ops 7 rewards</a>. Black Ops 7 features double level XP, weapon XP, and GobbleGum earn rates from now until November 24.</p><p dir="ltr">The full Black Ops 7 patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional multiplayer maps, and a brand-new Zombies map.

Now that we've had time to collect data and player feedback, we're making a slight adjustment as we do with all aspects of gameplay over time to hit our targets and address the wide range of feedback.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum Rotational Aim Assist strength. When the right-stick isn’t used, or isn’t tracking a target effectively, players now experience a minimum Rotational Aim Assist strength. At launch, the minimum Rotational Aim Assist was a 35% reduction from the Beta. Our goal for this new mechanic and our other Aim Assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs. This slightly overshot our balance target, so we’re making a small tuning adjustment to the minimum Rotational Aim Assist.</p><p>Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it’s crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals. As always, we'll continue to closely examine game data and player feedback.</p><ul><li>Minimum Rotational Aim Assist penalty reduced from 35% to 25%.</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p>We are pushing an early round of weapon tuning that aims at addressing some of the common pieces of feedback we have been seeing at launch. The main area of feedback has been SMG balance, particularly in relation to Assault Rifles. Most of our changes today aim to reduce the versatility of our highest performing ARs, and improve the mid-range performance of SMGs. You can find more details below. Aside from the SMGs, we have a handful of other individual weapon and prestige attachment adjustments. In general we really like the class variety we have been seeing so far.</p><p>This is just the beginning for weapon tuning in the opening weeks of Black Ops 7. We’ll be continuing to dial things in across weapons, prestige attachments, and the general attachment portfolio as we roll into our first season.</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><p>Assault Rifles are receiving a small flinch nerf so that they flinch harder than SMGs. This is not a huge adjustment, as we also don’t want to introduce lucky headshots into our full-auto gunfights. This flinch increase is small enough that it may affect players aiming for headshots and not well centered, but still not force most torso shots into headshots unintentionally.</p><p>Weapon Class Adjustment</p><ul><li>Received Flinch increased from .15N to .18N.</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><p>SMGs are receiving a similar list of buffs across the board. Baseline, they are all receiving an improvement to their final damage range to add a handful of meters to some of their mid-range power. In addition, multiple attachments are receiving substantial improvements to their damage range traits. Our goal here is to help SMGs to contend with ARs more effectively out into medium ranges, but also require some build investment to do so especially well. We still want players to make some choices between creating ultra-fast SMG builds and those that have higher range capabilities, but Gunfighter shouldn’t feel like a requirement.</p><p>Similarly, the Rear Grip attachments that improve recoil are seeing a buff. There’s a tough handling tradeoff when taking recoil in that node, so we felt there was room to push these further. A few of the SMGs are receiving additional, baseline improvements to recoil as well.</p><p>Overall, we think this will give SMGs a more solid footing in Black Ops 7. We’ll continue to fine tune to make sure both SMGs and ARs have a role to play across our map portfolio.</p><p><strong>Weapon Class Adjustment</strong></p><ul><li>Received Flinch reduced from 0.17N to 0.12N.</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><p>The Warden 308 and M34 Novaline are both very high-power, precision weapons that we see doing very well so far in Black Ops 7. Our sentiment here is the same as the X9 Maverick, in that we are excited to have Marksman Rifles in the mix and want to keep it that way. For now we want to make sure there’s some counterplay to these weapons, and that playing aggressively with them requires attachment investment.

During our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">cover story </a>trip to Tokyo, Japan, to play <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, <em>Game Informer </em>had the opportunity to interview Horii for 90 minutes and asked him about the differences between game development in the 1980s and in 2025.</p><p>He says the entire landscape is completely different.&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, the development landscape is just completely different compared to back then," Horii tells <em>Game Informer</em>. "On the original Dragon Quest, we had a team of less than 10 people, but now we have a team of 300 to 400 spending years and years making one game; not to mention the rising development cost, too. So it's just completely different."&nbsp;</p><p>Horii says back in the early years of Dragon Quest, he recalls doing the programming, some of the art – "I would just do everything by myself," he recalls, reminiscing on his early development days leading up to Dragon Quest.&nbsp;</p><p>"People would just do that, and that [game] actually got sold as a finished product back then – just one person working on a single game," he adds. "That's just not something that can happen today."&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, games developed by just one person release all the time, and there's an argument to be made that the growth within the indie scene proves it's not only possible, but easier than ever. But Horii is likely thinking within the Dragon Quest franchise, and in that regard, he's right – making something like Dragon Quest XI or the in-development Dragon Quest XII as a solo developer sounds like a much more challenging, if not impossible, task compared to the 1980s.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/21/yuji-horii-on-early-days-in-game-dev-i-would-just-do-everything]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality.1361137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Sonos made its name with WiFi streaming alone, avoiding Bluetooth at all costs to keep audio quality high. It finally relented with portable speakers, realizing convenience does matter for some use cases without invalidating the core WiFi basis of what makes Sonos so great. The <strong>Era 100</strong> competes directly with Bose and Sony’s premium offerings while it currently sells for mid-range pricing that makes no sense given its capabilities. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">dropped this to $169 for Black Friday, down from $199, which is a record low</a> that puts exceptional audio within reach of anyone looking for Bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>47% Faster Processor Powers Dual-Tweeter Architecture</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor handles more complex audio processing in real time and enables features that previous Sonos speakers couldn’t support. Dual tweeters create genuine stereo separation from a single speaker, placing instruments and vocals in distinct left and right positions. This architecture produces a soundstage that fills rooms rather than feeling like sound emanates from a single point. The <strong>25% larger midwoofer extends bass response deeper than the previous generation</strong>, and gives kick drums and bass lines actual impact without needing a separate subwoofer for most music.</p>
<p>This compact design fits easily on bookshelves, kitchen counters, desks and nightstands. You place the speaker wherever you really spend time, rather than arranging furniture around audio equipment. <strong>The size makes it truly portable inside your home</strong>&nbsp;and moves from room to room as the day progresses with you. It weighs enough to feel substantial yet remains light enough to carry easily in one hand.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi streaming provides lossless audio quality from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. The connection also remains stable throughout a home without the dropouts that plague Bluetooth in larger spaces. You control playback through the Sonos app which aggregates all of your streaming services into one interface. AirPlay 2 support adds another streaming option for Apple users who want to send audio directly from their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity handles quick pairing with phones</strong>, tablets, and laptops when you want simple wireless playback. You press a button on the back of the speaker, and instantly, your device finds it. This mode is great for playing podcasts, audiobooks, or music from apps that aren’t integrated into the Sonos ecosystem. The implementation of Bluetooth maintains decent quality, though Wi-Fi streaming sounds noticeably better when that option is available.</p>
<p>The Line-In Adapter includes <strong>a 3.5mm auxiliary input to connect turntables</strong>, CD players, or other analog sources. This adapter is available separately but turns the Era 100 into a powered speaker for vinyl setups or legacy audio equipment. It combines digital streaming with analog input flexibility that pure Bluetooth speakers simply can’t compete with.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to <strong>analyze room acoustics and then automatically adjust the speaker’s EQ</strong>. You wave your phone around the listening area for about a minute, and it makes a custom sound profile optimized for your particular space. This calibration compensates for room characteristics, such as hard surfaces that create reflections or soft furnishings that absorb sound. The difference between tuned and untuned sound is immediately noticeable, with vocals becoming clearer and bass tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Alexa integration enables voice control</strong> for music playback, smart home commands, and general queries. The built-in microphones pick up voice commands clearly even when music plays at moderate volumes. You can add the Era 100 to multi-room setups with other Sonos speakers, creating a whole-home audio system that plays synchronized music everywhere or different content in each room. This ecosystem approach means starting with one speaker and expanding over time as budget allows.</p>
<p>For $169, you’re getting Sonos premium audio engineering, with both WiFi and Bluetooth for less than mid-range speakers elsewhere that can’t compete on sound quality. Similarly priced Bose and Sony speakers rely exclusively on Bluetooth and don’t have the multi-room capabilities that make Sonos special.</p>

                <p>For years, Sony focused almost exclusively on releasing its games for PlayStation platforms, and while the company's focus remains in the console market, it has expanded to PC in recent years. A new report says Sony is having plenty of success with these efforts, with its PC releases thus far collectively bringing in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.</p><p>A <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Alinea Analytics</a> put forth this number, based on its own research. The best-selling PlayStation game on PC is Helldivers 2, the report said, selling more than 12.7 million copies.</p><p>In total, the report said Sony's five top-selling PC releases on Steam have passed 43 million copies sold collectively. The gross revenue from these sales reportedly amounted to $1.5 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for Sony and Valve's cut of $350 million or more. Valve takes a 30% cut of PC game sales on Steam, falling to 25% after $10 million in revenue and $20% after 50 million.</p><p>The report added that Helldivers 2 players are seriously engaged with the game, with a reported one-fifth of players logging more than 100 hours total. More than 200,000 people who own the game on Steam play it every day, the report said.</p><h2><strong>PlayStation's top-selling PC games on Steam</strong></h2><ul><li>Helldivers 2 -- 12.7 million</li><li>Horizon: Zero Dawn -- 4.5 million</li><li>God of War -- 4.2 million</li><li>Days Gone -- 3.4 million</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man -- 2.7 million</li></ul><p>While Sony is obviously enjoying success with its PC releases, the report said there are signs that show interest in PlayStation games on PC may be slowing down.</p><p>"All of Sony's major franchises have already landed on PC. The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served. Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this," the report said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722" data-ratio="0.57978723404255" data-width="1128" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722"></a><figcaption>Helldivers 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg"></figure><p>Looking ahead, Alinea said the challenge PlayStation faces is landing on the right window for PC releases that "protects PS5 software sales while still satisfying a PC audience that increasingly expects timely releases."</p><p>Sony does not have any strict schedules for when a PlayStation game may come to PC, except for the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">commitment to launch live-service games simultaneously for console and PC. </a>The company's marquee first-party PS5 games will not come to PC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026">at least a year</a> after they originally debut on console.</p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said Sony doesn't release those games day-and-date across console and PC as part of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">protect the PlayStation console ecosystem</a>. "Our single-player, narrative-driven titles that are the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history--we take a more strategic approach," he said.</p><p>The Alinea report also raised the question of if Sony might look to shift its strategy in response to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> launch in 2026. The console-like six-inch cube PC could shake things up.</p><p>"If Steam begins to function as a competing ecosystem with its own dedicated hardware that plays PlayStation titles, the relationship changes," Alinea's Rhys Elliott said. "PlayStation may soon face pressure to rethink its timing and release strategy as Steam evolves from a distribution platform into a rival platform with broader reach and fewer constraints."</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing PC releases for a long time already, and the company has indicated that its next Xbox platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-says-hardware-is-core-to-the-xbox-ecosystem/1100-6536289/" data-ref-id="1100-6536289">could embrace more PC sensibilities</a>. The other big platform-holder, Nintendo, does not release any games on PC.</p><p>Strauss Zelnick, the head of Rockstar owner Take-Two, recently made headlines when he said the gaming industry is "moving towards PC."</p><p>"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>. "But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen--that's never going away."</p>
