		<p>On the horizon, the number 34 glows on a black monolith. Beside it is the Paintress, an immense humanoid creature with long white hair that covers her face. She waves her hand at the number and it fades away, only for her to replace it with ’33’. Just as she does so, everyone in the world who is of that age turns into smoke and dies, blowing away in the wind. Gustave, is preparing for Expedition 33, the 77th expedition to venture into the fractured world and attempt to defeat the Paintress.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmJ9mE8LMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s the delightfully weird setup for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a theme that runs throughout the game. It’s not just felt through the story or the world either, this is a turn based RPG with real time parrying and dodging elements. It’s got tiny creatures made of wood and giant mythical creatures that are somehow all equally eccentric. And it’s got a protagonist that looks a bit like Robert Pattinson, who played Batman, yet he is voiced by Charlie Cox, who played Daredevil. Like I said, it’s weird from top to bottom.</p>


<p>Gustave is from Paris, or at least from a fragment of Paris that found itself torn from its usual place and left as an island in an ocean after the apocalypse. It’s from here that you set out to reach and defeat the Paintress, after the above setup of course. Then, after everything immediately goes wrong as expected, you find yourself exploring a world made up of the remaining fragments of the old world as you find the survivors of your expedition and make your way towards your goal.</p>


<p>Of course it’s not just a pleasant hike, there’s a variety of strange creatures in your way, so it’s pretty handy that you’ve got magic powers. The turn-based battling here is distinctive and very satisfying. In a manner not too dissimilar from Mario’s RPGs, quicktime events are sprinkled throughout each encounter, boosting your attacks to deal more damage if you time button presses just right, increasing healing, or causing additional status effects, like burn. When on the defensive, timing your dodge will let you avoid damage entirely, while parrying all the hits in an attack let you launch a counter to deal quite a bit of damage in return.&nbsp;Dodging and parrying don’t have onscreen prompts, so you’re left to work out the timing based on the attack animations, some of which can be fiendishly deceptive, and if you miss the mark you’re going to soak up the damage instead.</p>
<p>Each member of your party is radically different, yet exceptionally powerful in their own way. Gustave, for example, builds up charges that can be used to deal very large amounts of lightning damage to enemies, whilst Maelle has skills that switch her between stances that have different effects, such as an aggressive stance that increases damage or a defensive one that increases defence and action point accumulation.</p>

<p>As they level up you’ll naturally be able to unlock more attribute points and new skills to tailor them to your preferred playstyle, but then there’s also the Picto system. Each Picto provides your character a bonus, such as a perfect dodge granting an additional action point, or a basic attack having a chance to apply marked to an enemy, increasing the next damage it takes. Once you’ve had a Picto equipped on any character for four battles, anyone in the party can equip this effect by spending Lumia points, which are only limited by how many of a certain resource you can find.</p>
<p>Basically, you can add a suite of additional effects to each character to further customise them to your playstyle. The combat system is intricate and full of depth, enough that finding another character can sometimes feel a little overwhelming with all the new information you suddenly need to learn. Thankfully they’re carefully explained in a tutorial for each, so it doesn’t take long to get used to things again.</p>
<p>The enemies you’re fighting are a varied bunch, too. From little wooden creatures to gigantic creatures made of stone and glowing runes. They’re admittedly not the most unique designs and could slot quite easily into a few other games, but most importantly there’s a lot of variety in how they fight. Sure, one area tends to have a lot of the same enemies wandering through it, just waiting for you to run up to them and hit them so you get the first hit once it transitions to combat, but the regularity with which the game introduces unique and novel mechanics, sometimes even just for a single fight, keeps things fresh. A couple of highlights include fighting off the Gestrals, the aforementioned wooden creatures that fight inside huge suits made of cloth, hay, and cannons, and a battle with a turtle who couldn’t move.</p>

<p>Probably my favourite aspect of the game, however, has come to be its sense of humour. The Gestrals, which caused immediate dread in me when I first encountered them after the many adorable and annoying creatures I’ve seen through my gaming life, turned out to be quite funny in a chaotic way and managed to not outstay their welcome. Then there’s Esquie, a giant flying mythical being who is equal parts powerful, eccentric, and disinterested, another irreverent bit of comic relief. More than that, the conversations between the main characters are well written and really helped along by excellent performances from the voice cast and very expressive character models as well. The lighter moments really help you warm up to the characters and make them feel far more convincing, so when the darker, more serious moments hit they stand out better and hit harder.</p>
<p>Where it all leads, though, I’m not yet sure, as I’ve yet to finish the main story. This is a relatively long game with plenty of side stuff to get distracted by and, well, I’m not a machine! But so far, I’m really enjoying Expedition 33. The combat is a lot of fun provided you love some well timed parrying and there’s a lot of depth to tailoring your characters. You can even find clothes to dress them up in, which is especially entertaining in the cutscenes – one of my characters currently has red sunglasses, a black and white striped shirt, and a baguette strapped to her back like a sword. So it’s great, but I’ll let you know just how great once I’ve finished it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has become something of a media darling since its announcement last year. Sandfall Interactive’s next big thing has made quite a splash with its fantasy designs and turn-based stylings.</p>

<p>In an age where high-profile turn-based games have become a rare item, <em>Clair Obscur</em> intends to shatter trends by forgoing an action-based system and creating something that evolves from tradition. This philosophy in design is something that became ever clearer the more I delved deep into the full game.</p>

<p>But can that type of nostalgic pull last for a full 30-hour outing? I think largely it can, and the doors it opens next will be something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur</em> starts off in a fanciful way fitting of its overlong name: this is a world marked by death, but it’s not as grim as it might seem from the outset. Each year, a mysterious entity known as the Paintress wakes from her slumber and paints a number on a monolith, signaling the death of everyone who has passed that age, with more deaths set to pile up year after year as the number decreases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250408174146_1.jpg?itok=x2vvH3nB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250408174146_1.jpg?itok=jjKomXTH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This year marks the year she’ll paint 33, and it's from here that the story kicks off the titular Expedition 33 in a mission to stop the Paintress once and for all.</p>

<p>The members of this Expedition 33 include Gustav, an engineer; Maelle, Gustav’s foster sister; Lune, a scholar and focused mage; and Sciel, a scythe-wielding foreteller. There are some other characters the Expedition will meet along the way as well, and much of that happens naturally over the course of the story.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur</em> thrives on that sort of sense of discovery. Not everything is handed to the player upfront – there’s a lot of earning to be done, and the way this applies to the story makes for some great impact. I feel the sort of slow introduction to everyone really helped build up an emotional investment that says these characters are worth spending time with.</p>

<p>And they are, because they’re all in this together, and each one is just as valuable as the other.</p>

<p>The story itself is built on tragedy, sure, but the core theme of banding together to bring hope back to the world is a strong throughline. It helps that the emotional investment is earned, and the payoff complements the setup in spades.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250411214811_1.jpg?itok=pohJPcZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250411214811_1.jpg?itok=NA_Kc-mD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay of <em>Clair Obscur</em> centers around a turn-based battle system that calls back to classic PS2 RPGs of old, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/final-fantasy-x-endgame-bitesize-nature" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy X</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rewind-review-shadow-hearts-covenant" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Hearts</em></a>. The twist is, they’ve expanded on those traditional systems with the incorporation of time attacks that happen in real time.</p>

<p>What that means is that it works twofold for both party members and enemies. Party members can take advantage of a mechanic known as Free Aim, which lets characters such as Gustav fire a gun and target potential weak points on opponents while consuming Action Points or AP. Main attacks come with quick time prompts that need to be hit successfully to improve the viability of each attack.</p>

<p>On the enemy side of things, the Expedition will be forced to manually dodge or parry incoming hits at the tap of a button, with the reward being 1 AP for the effort. <em>Clair Obscur</em> makes it vital to study attack patterns, or else it’s really going to hurt, and I found it especially punishing later in the game when the bosses really ramp up the difficulty.</p>

<p>Even some normal enemies can decimate the entire team, so it’s important to use everyone to their strengths and exploit things like elemental weaknesses when at all possible. Executing everything perfectly leads to some flashy, satisfying attacks.</p>

<p>To facilitate this, <em>Clair Obscur</em> offers up a lot of different customization options when it comes to each character and their actions in battle. In addition to the RPG-typical upgradable weapons, the Expedition can equip items known as Pictos, which increase stats and allow for passive abilities known as Lumina. Lumina abilities are then equipped using Lumina Points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250408155641_1.jpg?itok=lHeeCAav 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250408155641_1.jpg?itok=nKf2vuPf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>They’re pretty handy when it comes to tailoring the type of playstyle, and especially when encountering some of the tougher enemies.</p>

<p>Also like other RPGs, <em>Clair Obscur</em> relies on a Skill Tree system where each character can be assigned Attribute Points to unlock new skills as they level. Paying attention to skills will become more important as the game goes on and can be respeced if needed.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, the other core part of <em>Clair Obscur</em> centers on exploration. While there isn’t a minimap charting out where to go, there is a scaled-down world map that exists between each area. Eventually, the Expedition will be able to travel across the sea as the story progresses.</p>

<p>Camping is one of the activities exclusive to the world map. They’re a good place to unwind, chat with other party members, and build relationships by spending time with them. It's here where weapons can be upgraded using field items known as Chroma Catalysts.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in some of the most gorgeous art direction and design I’ve seen in a contemporary game. Colors are plentiful, and there’s an artistic feel to each area that transcends traditional fantasy. For example, there’s an area that’s essentially a waterless sea complete with creatures floating about like they would in water.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250409155149_1.jpg?itok=FJNOwCyH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250409155149_1.jpg?itok=yPNFFg93 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The overall aesthetic in <em>Clair Obscur</em> comes together in its own original way, and the breadth of imagination here is staggering.</p>

<p>It’d be remiss of me to forget about the music, which is just as plentiful and full of character. There’s so much variety here, and some tracks really kick up in the middle of boss battles or important moments. The soundtrack is simply a feast for the ears.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is, without a doubt, one of the best games so far this year. It’s incredibly polished in what it sets out to do, has spectacular art direction, music, and a compelling story and characters. Whilst difficulty can ratchet up unexpectedly and getting the timing down for encounters can at times be frustrating, the ultimate payoff for getting through those challenges makes it well worth it.</p>

<p>On top of all that, there’s even more to do aside from the main story, so with that in mind, I see myself coming back to explore for just a little while longer.</p>

The French RPG is clearly inspired by the Japanese greats like <em>Final Fantasy </em>and <em>Persona</em>, but its <em>Paper Mario</em>-style timing elements and wealth of original mechanics keep its grind engaging and decidedly modern. My time with the game hasn’t been without frustrations, but I’m writing these impressions wishing I could be playing the game instead.

As the number ticks down with each subsequent painting, the human life expectancy dwindles with it, for people disappear into dust when they reach the designated age. In a years-long effort to stop the Paintress from shortening human life, people in their final year form expeditions dedicated to reaching and killing her. The titular 33rd expedition has many world-weary characters among its ranks, including the swordsman and gunslinger Gustave, the mage Lune, and the rapier-wielding Maelle, and they set off bravely on their daunting journey. Soon, however, they cross paths with a mysterious man who has somehow aged beyond the 33 on the Paintress’ monolith, who then slaughters most of the group, except a small crew.</p><p>Despite heavy losses, protocol is to keep moving forward, and that’s because the expeditions don’t seek out the Paintress because they believe they can be the ones to stop her; they do it to lay the groundwork for those who, they hope, eventually can. Gustave, the de facto leader of the group, often says “for those who come after” when doing his signature attacks in battle or writing in his journal about their journey. As I travel through different regions across the game’s sizable world, I keep finding old documents from the expeditions that came before. Being part of an expedition isn’t an act of self-preservation; it’s believed to be a suicide mission to make way for the next one. <em>Clair Obscur</em> is bleak, melodramatic, and full of dramatic gut punches that make the team’s efforts feel futile. There’s not much reason to hope. Nevertheless, the expedition persists.</p><figure id="" data-id="79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-recommend-id="image://79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gustave looks up as petals fall around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gustave looks up as petals fall around him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-recommend-id="image://79fe2026a8dc711cfca2f19f6cf16eaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gustave looks up as petals fall around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Clair Obscur</em>’s core premise has drawn me in, but the game pulls from so many different genres that I’m still figuring out the nature of its world. Sometimes it looks like a steampunk setting full of ramshackle technological advancements; elsewhere, like in an underwater area that the expedition can somehow walk around and breathe in, the magic bubbles to the surface. This eclectic approach manifests not just in the world, but also in the creatures who inhabit it, and even in a surprisingly diverse soundtrack that draws from genres ranging from orchestral to Skrillex-esque dubstep. And as you cross the distance between home and the Paintress, you’ll find inhuman creatures, beings who were long believed to be fairy tales by humanity, and what seem to be the remnants of long-lost societies..</p><p>While the world is fascinating enough that I often get distracted from my expedition’s stated goal by my desire to explore and learn more about its history, unfortunately the game has also forced me to do some meandering I’d rather not have engaged in. One of the biggest problems undermining my travels has been the lack of a mini-map in dungeons, towns, and other bespoke locales. I am historically a directionally challenged individual. I have to have a GPS open to navigate my own city just to reassure myself I’m going the right way. So moving through dark caves or villages I’ve never been to before without any kind of navigational tools has been annoying at best, momentum-killing at worst. Last year, <em>1000xResist </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fellowtraveller.games/blog/1000xresist-now-has-a-map&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fellowtraveller.games/blog/1000xresist-now-has-a-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patched in a map</a></span> after enough people complained about how hard it was to get around the adventure game’s hub. I hope <em>Clair Obscur </em>follows suit because I’ve been hugging walls just to make sure I’m not running in circles.</p><p>Also getting in the way have been the various monsters I’ve faced on my journey. Its sense of melodrama is one obvious way in which <em>Clair Obscur</em> draws from <em>Final Fantasy</em>, but it’s the turn-based systems that I’ve been missing from the series for decades. At a glance, <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s battles look like your standard turn-based RPG fights full of elemental affinities and status effects, but what helps it stand out is how each party member has their own distinct mechanics that create really interesting opportunities for party synergy.</p><p>For example, Maelle has different stances that determine her damage output or intake. But you don’t simply switch between them freely; they’re determined by what ability you use in the previous turn. There are stances that prioritize attack or defense, but there’s a third one called Virtuose Stance that doubles her damage output for her next attack. Maelle swaps between these three depending on which attack she uses and if they can chain together with other status effects and abilities. One attack shifts her into Virtuose Stance if she’s aiming at an enemy afflicted with a burn status, but after she unleashes one attack in that stance, she’ll default to her “stanceless” mode. Normally, it would take a couple of turns of setup to get her back into that superpowered stance to deal that kind of damage again, but I unlocked an attack that, if used while in Virtuose Stance, maintains it for the next turn, letting me skewer an enemy once again the next time it was Maelle’s turn.</p><figure id="" data-id="045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-recommend-id="image://045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Clair Obscur battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Clair Obscur battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-recommend-id="image://045afd111ab1b411b3d2a442416be715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Clair Obscur battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The more I learned how best to wield each character’s original skills, the more I got into <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s groove. Gustave has a powerful ability called Overcharge, in which he uses his prosthetic arm to unleash a powerful electric blast on an enemy, but it has to charge throughout several turns. Through equipping him with different Pictos, which give characters far-reaching passive abilities that go beyond simple stat buffs and debuffs, I was able to let him gain charges simply by avoiding enemy attacks. So if I were fighting a powerful boss that would periodically unleash a barrage of attacks against my team, I could easily unleash my own devastating Overcharge in a turn or two. </p><p>I keep being surprised at how robust the customization options are and how they let you feed into these kinds of strategies. Everyone’s kit is built to tactically bounce off one another’s, and there’s a lot of room to experiment. Turn-based RPGs can easily drive you into simple patterns of attacking elemental weaknesses or just grinding until the numbers go up enough to overpower any foe you face. <em>Clair Obscur</em> has so many systems that allow for creativity, all without ever getting too overwhelming. There are still some characters I’m trying to wrap my head around, including the scythe-wielding Sciel whose mechanics are a bit more complicated, but the more I play, the more I discover how well these systems fall into place and feed into each other.</p><p>The key element that strings all of these together are the timing-based moves reminiscent of those in something like <em>Paper Mario</em>. Every attack in <em>Clair Obscur </em>can be dodged or parried, but you have to do this manually for each incoming strike. Dodges have a slightly larger timing window, but parries can be followed up with a strong counterattack. However, most enemies will unleash combos on the team, and you have to parry every hit to counter, so there’s a risk vs. reward aspect at play. And when enemies do land a hit, it <em>hurts</em>. <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s defensive moves aren’t just a cool thing you can do if you’re feeling spicy; they’re integral to surviving in battle.</p><p>I really love this concept on paper because it could make even the most tedious, grindy encounter engaging, but in practice, after 15 hours with the game, I still find there to be a lack of consistency on the cues for when to dodge. Really, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to every enemy as their combos are all different, they move in distinct ways, and sometimes they’ll use an attack that can only be avoided with a specific method. Which is good for keeping you on your toes, but there are several points at which the dodge window is so precise, and also so poorly telegraphed, that it can be as frustrating as it is rewarding. Not to be one of those sore losers who declares “it’s not me, it’s the game,” but I grew up on character action games and fighting games and like to think I’m a pretty rhythmically inclined player. I know how to dodge and parry, I’m a sicko for that shit, but <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s integration of these techniques lacks clarity.</p><p>That being said, I’m getting better at it as I go along. <em>Clair Obscur </em>isn’t necessarily challenging in the traditional sense, but it can be punishing when you miss a dodge and find yourself on the wrong end of a team wipe. But all of its systems still coalesce into something that’s really rewarding to experiment with, and I’m excited to keep going. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna submit this draft and play some more so I can get a more comprehensive review out the door. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thank you for everything, Bethesda!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyblivion</a> is an upcoming fan remake of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion made by the TESRenewal volunteer modding group. It uses Bethesda's Creation Engine to recreate Oblivion in the game's sequel, Skyrim. The project has technically been in the works for over a decade, beginning as a simple direct port and later expanding to a full remake with a number of improved features and even new content. We interviewed one of the developers behind it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyblivion-oblivion-skyrim-mod-elder-scrolls">way back in 2021</a>. Skyblivion is expected to release this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, Bethesda and the Skyblivion team have reportedly been on "<a href="https://www.vg247.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-remake-mod-lead-interview-c3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good terms</a>," but as rumors of an official Oblivion remaster grew, some fans questioned if Bethesda wasn't trying to head off Skyblivion with its own version due to the suspiciously close release timing. A few days ago, anticipating today's showcase, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k285wg/official_statement_from_the_skyblivion_team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> addressing these concerns.

Additionally, both versions of Oblivion have unique aspects: Skyblivion, for instance, isn't available on console at all. Oblivision Remastered, on the other hand, does not include the new and refurbished content that Skyblivion has promised, but does have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-once-again-offering-paid-horse-armor-dlc">horse armor DLC</a> at launch for Deluxe Edition buyers. Both versions have different looks and feels, with different interpretations on how much Skyrim-ness should be incorporated into a retread of Oblivion.

Here’s a quote from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-really-blew-its-ending-1830170997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article I wrote complaining about <em>AC Odyssey</em>’s ending all the way back in November 2018</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>As </em>Odyssey<em> dragged itself towards its final few story missions, though, I noticed the pacing was off. Having spent dozens of hours spinning its wheels, everything seems to ramp up out of nowhere, then end abruptly with much of the story and its mysteries—especially the fate of the Cult—left unresolved. I was very disappointed.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Here’s me, again, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking about how <em>Valhalla</em>’s ending sucked in January 2021</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Ultimately, </em>Valhalla<em>’s length added a little despair to my final thoughts on the game. The bloat created grind, which diluted the whole experience, and often felt like it was keeping my attention solely through brute force and checklists. It left me parting with a game I LOVED on less than lovely terms, which was a damn shame.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And here’s me remembering all of that <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>earlier this month</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Their problems aren't that they suck, but that they were just too big. Too long. </em>Odyssey<em> and </em>Valhalla<em> especially vastly overstayed their welcome with drawn-out (sometimes multiple) storylines and DLC, meaning a lot of people parted with those games on poor terms. Those negative views have perhaps coloured both game's legacy in ways unfair to their core experience.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Despite that mountain of evidence I had naively thought, having as much fun as I’d been having with <em>Shadows </em>up to that point, that it surely wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes its predecessors had made. That Ubisoft, with nearly a decade of experience and feedback that its open-world games were too damn long, would have taken steps to do something, anything, to address that.</p><p>Nope! <em>Shadows </em>absolutely botches its landing, and just like its predecessors. It botches it so badly that it’s soured my feelings on the entire game.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what happens as you approach the end of <em>Shadows</em>, which is much the same as happened in <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Odyssey </em>before it: Over the course of <em>dozens </em>of hours of fantastic video game, a few different storylines begin to emerge. In <em>Shadows’ </em>case, there’s the main saga, which involves a shadowy cabal of mask-wearing villains and their evil deeds, but there are also branching, more intimate tales, telling the personal stories of our two heroes, Naoe and Yasuke.</p><p>You would think, given the way each supporting story elegantly branches off and is intertwined with the main one, that <em>Shadows</em> would also find a way to tie them all back together again at the end. They do not. What happens in <em>Shadows</em> is that you finish the main story with a limp cutscene, and are then returned to the game to tie up your loose ends. Which, with the main storyline now done, also lack any kind of real impact or satisfaction. Indeed all three storylines don’t just end poorly, they don’t feel like they end at <em>all</em>, the credits somehow managing to roll 2-3 missions before you’d think they would have and, thanks to the game’s incessant grind for levels and repetitive tasks, 10-20 hours later than they should have.</p><p>After 70-80 hours of gameplay, during which emotional stories are told and you’re drawn deep into your character’s journey, to have it all end so abruptly is a HUGE disappointment. I wanted to see these guys get revenge–indeed, how each of them deals with the concept is a <em>huge </em>part of the narrative and your choices–and while Yasuke gets a little, Naoe’s backstory has barely begun before it’s abruptly shuttered.</p><p>What’s maddening here is that this clearly isn’t a strictly narrative decision. The way each storyline pulls up short is a good reminder that this game isn’t done, and that, like <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>, there is more to come <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows/expansion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via at least one expansion</a>. Argh! You can't end the main game with teasers of what's to come, that's bullshit. The decision to cliffhang an 80-hour game has left me in the same position I was left in after the last few games: soured, my good times relegated to the rearview mirror as I file away <em>Shadows</em> on the shitty terms I parted with, not the glee which took up the bulk of my time with it.&nbsp;</p><p>My <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> piece earlier this month was mostly about how, for all Ubisoft’s talk and publicity, <em>Shadows</em> was a lot more similar to the last few games in the series than we’d maybe been expecting. Which was fine for the good stuff, but it’s a real shame to see those similarities extend right through to <em>Shadows</em>’ ending, and it’s something Ubisoft are going to need to address going forwards if they want people to stop parting with these games on such depressing terms.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

<section><p>As much as the world needs games that make us feel secure and cozy, I believe we need games that encourage and empower us, too.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Lately, the world feels pretty bleak.</p><p dir="ltr">I spend a lot of energy these days just telling myself that, in many ways, this is the best the collective human race has ever had it. I try my hardest to muster up some semblance of gratitude, for self-preservation if nothing else. People who are far wiser and more well-adjusted than myself will tell you that being buried in overwhelming dread is exactly what the powers that be want; that maintaining a sense of joy is vital during times like these. In my experience, they're absolutely right. As such, I've tried my hardest to remain uncompromising when it comes to living a life still sprinkled with joy--after all, who would be inclined to live and fight for misery?</p><p dir="ltr">I try to spend as much time as possible around loved ones and touch plenty of grass, but admittedly, an element in my attempts to enjoy life and process all of <em>this</em> has been video games. This probably isn't a surprising or novel claim. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're a gamer and are very familiar with the healing power and delightful escapism associated with games. Recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cozy-games-may-help-improve-players-mental-health-researchers-say/1100-6529075/">Reuters</a> published a study regarding the positive impact that cozy games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> can have on mental health. According to the study, there is essentially "no statistically significant difference between playing a video game and engaging in meditation." I love this fact, mostly because it makes me feel a bit less guilty when my husband catches me playing Fields of Mistria at 11 o'clock at night.</p><p dir="ltr">But while I have found myself gravitating towards games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/" data-ref-id="5000-575786">Fields of Mistria</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hello-kitty-island-adventure/" data-ref-id="5000-592240">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a> in my spare time--both of which are incredibly fun, free of oligarchs, and <em>adorable</em>--these sweet adventures offering a detour from reality aren't always what I turn to. And though they're certainly relaxing, they're also not the games making the largest positive impact on my mental health, either.</p><p dir="ltr">What I long for more than anything these days are tales of resistance; stories in which scrappy underdogs take on forces far larger than themselves. They're seldom fearless--no sensible person is, video game character or not--but that fear doesn't hinder them from doing the ethical thing. To invoke a Mr. Rogers quote I've always found charming, I suppose that even when it comes to video games, I'm "looking for the helpers."</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't a new phenomenon for me. When conversations turn to what "radicalized" me, to use the beloved meme template, I can vaguely pinpoint the moment many of my core beliefs and values began to form--it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-205">Final Fantasy VII</a> during the moment when Barrett Wallace began shooting at the heap of metal and concrete Shinra buried his home, friends, and, presumably, his young daughter Marlene beneath. "What's it all for?" he screams, his body heaving from both grief and the recoil of his bullets. Lately, I find myself asking the same question, over and over and over again. "What's it all for?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480849-qas%2810%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480849" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480849-qas%2810%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480849"></a><figcaption>Barrett from Final Fantasy VII calls out Shinra.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480849-qas%2810%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Barrett's cry is more than relatable, though--it's cathartic. Through the entirety of Final Fantasy VII, he serves as a beacon of love, bravery, and self-sacrifice. Barrett would lay down his life if doing so would better the lives of perfect strangers; he would fight ceaselessly, and savor the struggle, if it meant his daughter would never have to. He's the type of person I desperately want to believe exists, not just as a singular being, but as an inherent part of all of us. Barrett Wallace is a "helper."</p><p dir="ltr">I suspect this is in part why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/" data-ref-id="5000-590950">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> resonated so deeply with me last year, too. Throughout its entirety, as it delves headlong into topics such as prejudice, poverty, cycles of violence, anxiety, and religion, Metaphor repeatedly emphasizes the importance of caring for those around you and striving to be a just and empathetic person--a "helper," if you will. Its metanarrative then takes this one step further by boldly proclaiming that works like Metaphor--works that are earnest, honest, and above all else, hopeful--are far more than entertainment; they're vast wells of inspiration that exist in part to create even more helpers.</p><p dir="ltr">Stories, whether constructed by one person or a whole studio of people, contain our hopes, fears, dreams, experiences, and beliefs. They are the closest we can come to making the intangible, tangible--to sharing our internal worlds with one another in hopes of establishing resonance. And though not all works are intended to inspire, all works <em>can</em>, and thus the act of creating is one that can be immensely powerful. In Metaphor, I found a game that believes all of this as strongly as I do. Long after finishing the game, its hopefulness and reassurance continues to cloak me. And part of the reason it does is because I firmly believe it must cloak other people, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course some of Atlus' other titles, namely the Persona series, also encourage perseverance, kindness, and rising against oppression and cruelty. I'd be remiss not to mention how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/" data-ref-id="5000-115534">Persona 5</a> is a game all about taking on those who abuse power, even when that means standing up to dangerous people, the status quo, government institutions, and forces that make you feel small.</p><p dir="ltr">I also think about the time I spent playing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-trilogy/" data-ref-id="5000-154262">Mass Effect trilogy</a>, and how Shepherd's willingness to help divided communities reconcile, right past wrongs, and lay down their life repeatedly inspires resistance, bravery, and compassion. Sure, you don't <em>have </em>to play Shepherd that way, and there are some aspects of all of this the game doesn't quite get right, if we're being honest. But at its core, Mass Effect offers a power fantasy in which a large part of said fantasy is you having the power to change the entire <em>galaxy</em> for the better. Getting to make out with number one video game boyfriend Garrus is just a nice perk--though I'd argue it <em>does </em>reinforce the importance of holding on to those you have and finding joy even in dire circumstances.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480850-3799285-8283070286-latest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480850" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480850-3799285-8283070286-latest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480850"></a><figcaption>Garrus from Mass Effect holding his signature sniper rifle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480850-3799285-8283070286-latest.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But while RPGs tend to fit the bill more--after all, I'd bet most of us could easily list dozens in which a band of unlikely heroes come together to take on an oppressive regime or stop a Big Bad--there are a few other genres I've gravitated to that ignite me in a similar way.</p><p dir="ltr">Frankly, you can't talk about games centered around resistance and helping others without mentioning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dishonored/" data-ref-id="5000-110259">Dishonored</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein/" data-ref-id="5000-25503">Wolfenstein</a>. Throughout both of these action-adventure series, you play as characters who are part of small resistance groups hellbent on taking down an oppressive regime. Be it through stealth or overwhelming firepower, your mission ultimately boils down to fighting oppressors and helping to restore power to the citizenry they've abused. They also pose an interesting question: Which is truly more violent, the violence exerted through resistance, or the systemic, sanctioned violence that commands us to remain complicit?</p><p dir="ltr">The one and only "strand game," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a>, is also well worth mentioning here, as the entire game revolves around helping others and establishing connections. In a world flooded with fear and in which people are largely isolated from one another, Sam Porter Bridges serves as a bridge himself, helping people regain a sense of humanity and companionship. Sam's--and the player's--alturistic nature is further highlighted by another one of the game's key features, the Social Strand System. Although you will never meet all your fellow Death Stranding players, you are able (and encouraged!) to construct things that will improve not only your in-game world, but others as well. Naturally, this means you will reap the benefits of others' constructions, too, making this a game that highlights the importance of mutual aid.</p><p dir="ltr">In metroidvanias, the general conceit tends to be that once-powerful characters are rendered "weak," they still choose to embark on dangerous and surreal journeys, some of which help protect those around them. Gaining their powers back, and progression in general, does not come easily; there is a lot of trial involved and, oftentimes, the way forward requires going back, growing stronger, smarter, or better-equipped, and trying again later. In this way, these games emulate life.</p><p dir="ltr">And though it might sound a bit obtuse, soulslikes in particular have grown particularly comforting to me over the years. Most of the time, the stories and worlds they contain don't feel happy, safe, or gentle. But honestly, I prefer that they aren't. You can't overcome something if there's nothing to overcome; you can't feel assured in your strength or perseverance if they've never been tested; you can't appreciate light and beauty without fumbling through the dark and dire; and you can't appreciate being alive without acknowledging the finality of death.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480851-3759229-shrineofstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480851" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480851-3759229-shrineofstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480851"></a><figcaption>The Slayer of Demons trudges up a hill in Demon Souls.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480851-3759229-shrineofstorms.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though sometimes dismissed as brutal or grimdark, I've found inspiration and catharsis in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demons-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-513796">Demon Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bloodborne/" data-ref-id="5000-285291">Bloodborne</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" data-ref-id="5000-483352">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. Behind each grotesque creation, cutthroat swordmaster, hellish landscape, and violent end lies temporary refuge, spectacular sights, and the satisfaction of knowing you earned the right to these things. Sure, there will always be <em>something </em>lying just ahead, but just like in real life, these moments of peace are ones I cherish and savor. They offer a reminder that, despite everything, you are here now, trying your hardest to live and do good even when up against the dark and unfathomable. What an incredible feat that is.</p><p dir="ltr">I suppose all this is to say, as much as the world needs games that make us feel secure and cozy, I believe we need games that encourage and empower us, too; games that remind us that life is hard and dark but that we have the power to live, hope, and help. And though some might shy away from the idea of games being political--and the ones I've mentioned above are <em>maybe </em>not as overt as the likes of Disco Elysium, Papers, Please, Fallout: New Vegas, or countless other titles that explore capitalism and morality, or critique apathy and centrism--to me it's undeniable that all of these works of art are constructed out of experiences and core beliefs, which are perhaps the two biggest factors that guide our political ideologies. I find it beautiful to think that these creators believe in, and long to foster, goodness and progression.</p><p dir="ltr">And I get that not everyone wants to dig this deep. I get that not everyone will take away the same message or walk away transfixed and transformed. But I also have to believe that these stories do hold that power and there are plenty out there that, like me, are comforted, rejuvenated, and inspired by them. Lately, the world feels pretty bleak. But history, people, stories, and art remind me that nothing is insurmountable, and that a better world--and perhaps a cozy, lit bonfire--lie just ahead.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes across all 14 chapters, and it's worth your time to find them all to get the additional story context they provide.</p>
<p>The storytelling in South of Midnight is one of the game's strongest aspects, the notes included. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 11.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Chapter 11 is one of the lighter chapters, with only eight notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>An Anguished Cry</strong> - Early on in the chapter as you follow the path, you'll jump to a dock with exploding mushrooms covering the front end of it. Jump over the mushrooms and look to your left to find this note in the form of blue art on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stowaway's Tin Box</strong> - You can find this note in a room on the second floor of the wrecked ship, after dealing with the Stigma knot with Crouton. Walk into the room where the Stigma knot was, and turn right to find a Floof knot and this note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bill of Fare - </strong>This note can be found on the third floor of the ship, on a table on the left side of the room, where you enter, as Hazel says she remembers the story of the boat disappearing.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Old Pain, New Life</strong> - After viewing the second memory for Ayotunde, you'll find this note as another blue painting on the tree on the left side of the combat arena.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bittersweet Reunion</strong> - After seeing the third memory of Ayotunde's past, this note will appear as blue art on rocks on the left side of the main path as you move to continue the rest of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>False Knowledge</strong> - After avoiding the mud thrown by Altamaha-ha, and Honey helping you back onto the boat, you'll re-enter the boat by blowing through some pieces of wood blocking the path. This note will be on the left side of the room you enter, in the form of blue paint on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Captain's Log</strong> - You'll find this note on the right side of the room you enter after using the elevator, on a desk to the right of the boat's wheel, with a Floof knot in front of the wheel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Final Message</strong> - This last note can be found after the cutscene where Honey and Altamaha-ha meet, once again as a blue painting. It'll be on a large tree on the left side of the main path.</p>
<p>That's where to find all eight notes in Chapter 11. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 82 out of 103 notes. The search is almost over, with only 21 notes left to find.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo issued a subpoena request to a California court that, if approved, would require Discord to provide Nintendo the identity of the Pokemon Teraleaker. "Teraleak" is the moniker Pokemon fans gave to the massive leak from October 2024 that reportedly included not just information about Game Freak and The Pokemon Company's upcoming projects, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, but personal information about Game Freak employees as well. The leak also included data from past <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-pokemon-game-reviewed/2900-3706/" data-ref-id="2900-3706">Pokemon games</a>, including concept art and scrapped designs.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo owns approximately 33 percent of Pokemon, with Game Freak and The Pokemon Company owning the other two-thirds.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/561817/pokemon-teraleak-nintendo-discord-subpoena" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon </a>obtained a copy of Nintendo's court filing, which shows the company requested the leaker's name, address, phone number, and email address. Nintendo also provided redacted images taken from a Discord server called FreakLeak, where the leaker, who went by GameFreakOUT on the platform, posted 1 terabyte of information taken from Game Freak's internal servers. The image Nintendo provided in the court filing showed GameFreakOUT posting a file containing the leaked data and a message telling the group's members to "Enjoy."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo issued DMCA takedown notices in an attempt to remove the stolen data, though it remains publicly available online. While the company hasn't indicated an intent to sue the Pokemon leaker, Nintendo has a history of seeking litigation against those whose actions it perceives as a business threat.</p><p dir="ltr">Gary Bowser, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-prison/1100-6500590/" data-ref-id="1100-6500590">arrested on federal charges</a> of fraud for his part in creating and selling tools to hack video game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, so people could play games on their devices without paying for them. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/" data-ref-id="1100-6513332">Bowser was released from prison</a>, but owes Nintendo $10 million in compensation and has 25 percent of his monthly income garnished to pay the settlement.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Bethesda finally revealed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">launched The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, one of the games industry's worst-kept secrets for months, and caused a few ripples in the mod community by <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">publishing a post</a> that said Oblivion Remastered mods aren't supported. That's a slightly vague statement, as it only means that Bethesda has no plans to develop and support an official Oblivion Remastered creation kit like the studio did for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/">Skyrim</a> or some of its other games.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Oblivion Remastered still allows for<i> </i>mods, even without a creation kit. You can download and run Oblivion mods or try to make your own without any kind of penalty or fear of a ban. The game just might not run properly, hence Bethesda recommending players disable mods if their game crashes for no other discernible reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever issues may or may not be present with early mods, the Oblivion Remastered mod scene is already lighting up. NexusMods has a handful of creations, including one that<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/36" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> restores the color shading from Oblivion's original release</a>, one to turn the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">desktop icon</a> into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-adoring-fan-explained/1100-6531032/" data-ref-id="1100-6531032">Adoring Fan</a>, and one that makes a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/31" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">longsword deal 10,000 damage</a>, because why not. Early downloaders have also reported no issues getting these mods to work, and that may be due to how Bethesda and Virtuous made Oblivion Remastered. It's a hybrid of sorts, one that's built in Unreal Engine 5, but that still runs on the original Oblivion engine.</p><p dir="ltr">As of the time of publication, modders are uncertain about the ease of porting old Oblivion mods to the remaster, and whether it's even possible, as questions persist regarding how these changes might interact with Unreal Engine 5. However, they have discovered that it's possible to open Oblivion Remastered's files in the Oblivion Construction Set, a mod creation and management tool that lets creators modify the original game's files. Some modders said that, even while they wait to figure out how to create new assets and enable mods, they should still be able to work with existing assets--for example, tweaking existing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-classes-in-oblivion-remastered-all-elder-scrolls-4-classes/1100-6531030/" data-ref-id="1100-6531030">Oblivion classes</a> instead of making brand-new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">Once there's a greater consensus about how Oblivion Remastered mods work, we'll update with detailed steps for how to install them and a roundup of the best ones worth downloading.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, if you're just getting started in Oblivion for the first time or need a refresh, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a> for everything from tips on combat skills to how to navigate factions.</p>

			<p>The Onimusha series may not be as popular as other CAPCOM franchises, but it remains to this day one of the most unique series ever released by the Japanese publisher. Starting out as a different take on the formula made popular by the Resident Evil series, the franchise evolved considerably until the launch of Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, the latest entry in the series, which plays slightly differently from its predecessor, doing away with the signature fixed camera angles that make the series so different from the vast majority of action-adventure games of the time.</p>
<p>With a new entry in the series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> on the way, CAPCOM has decided to bring the second entry in the series, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, to modern gaming platforms with a remaster that aims to faithfully recreate the original game with improved visuals and some small additions which have little impact on the experience. This is, in my opinion, not a bad thing at all, as the game has aged incredibly well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250403123231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster is so faithful to the original, which I have gone through countless times back in the PlayStation 2 days but never revisited in over 20 years, that it felt instantly familiar. So much so that I could remember how much of the stiff but incredibly charming English language script was delivered by the voice actors, awkward pauses included. I also had no trouble getting used again to some of the game's unique mechanics, which, as mentioned above, have aged so well that I have no doubt even newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game and enjoying it.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, much like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">predecessor</a>, is a rather unique action-adventure game that strikes a happy medium between the survival horror experience of the first three entries in the Resident Evil series and the more action-oriented approach of the original Devil May Cry, whose development started back in the day, as a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Employing the same fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds of the older entries in the popular CAPCOM survival horror series, which have been touched up and upscaled like the 3D character models in the remaster, players control Jubei Yagyu as he embarks on a journey to gather the five orbs created to protect humans from demons and defeat Nobunaga Oda, the famous daimyo and one of the three great unifiers of Japan, who has become the lord of the demons following the death of Fortinbras by the hands of Samanosuke Akechi in the original Onimusha. During the course of his journey, Jubei will encounter multiple companions who will help him, depending on his actions, and involve him in their personal stories that will evolve as he continues his war against the demon lord.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250404005042_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The epic journey depicted in Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is extremely enjoyable right from the start. In the first few hours, the game immediately shows its best cards, featuring a combination of simple puzzle solving in the vein of the Resident Evil series and fast and engaging combat against all sorts of enemies, ranging from regular humans to powerful demons, which is made extremely enjoyable by Jubei's mobility and the many techniques he can employ using the currently equipped weapon, which include the thunder katana Buraitou and the ice spear Hyoujin-yari. Unlike the original Devil May Cry, which requires good knowledge of every ability at Dante's disposal, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a little less hardcore, meaning that even newcomers will instantly have fun unleashing elemental magical attacks and avoiding enemy techniques while they get to learn the intricacies of the combat system, which features plenty of advanced techniques, including a satisfying Issen critical attack with a strict timing that can kill enemies in a single blow. The fixed camera angles, sometimes, don't provide the best view in combat, especially against the powerful but incredibly memorable boss encounters, but even this flaw is part of the charm of the experience. Combat in the remaster is greatly enhanced by a new feature that allows Jubei to switch between different weapons on the fly, removing some of the downtime of the original, as weapons could only be swapped via the menu in the PlayStation 2 release.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny couldn't be releasing at a better time. With the next entry in the series still a ways off, this remaster will be an excellent way for veterans to get re-acquainted with the unique quirks of the franchise as well as for newcomers to understand why the series is so beloved. Jubei Yagyu's war against Nobunaga Oda will return on May 23rd on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>
What is a video game NPC, if not a scared creature that needs a bit of help? That's exactly what the just announced PANIK cuts right to the core of, and I've been charmed by it quite quickly. In PANIK, there are Panikers, which are a type of scared creature that are just so unbelievably anxious they cannot move from where they stand. This is where you come in, a, uh, well they didn't name the player character so I'll just keep saying you.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You, both the real you and this video game you, have to find different ways to get the Panikers to move. As the trailer quite deftly demonstrates, that might be as simple as moving right up to them on its simply designed but pleasing to look at isometric, square layout, calming them down instantly.

<p>This can even have a chain effect, as long as they all stand roughly adjacent to each other. Once they're calm enough to move themselves, you can guide them to specific chequered squares, which there might be more than one of. Fill them all up, and you've completed a level!
</p>
<p>
According to a press release, every Paniker you meet brings about a new mechanic, so you'll have to come up with new solutions every level. There's more than 100 of those, by the way, so it sounds like there's lots to dig your teeth into. Honestly PANIK is really giving me the vibe of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game you find and get sucked into during an IT lesson because who needs to learn about Excel again.
</p>
<p>
PANIK doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749610/PANIK/">Steam</a> here. Or, alternatively, if you fancy just a taste of it, you can try out an earlier version of it on <a href="https://chumasgames.itch.io/panik">itch.io</a>, which is quite good even if it's short!

As the developer thanked those who are playing Oblivion for the first time or revisiting it, it outright said it “never wanted to remake it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never wanted to remake it – but remaster it – where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today’s technology,” Bethesda explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s clarification arrives as fans not only (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">officially</a>) see Oblivion Remastered for the first time but also go hands-on, too. It’s out now, bringing visual changes across the board alongside a few fundamental gameplay tweaks. Highlights include the ability to sprint as well as a new level-up system that is being described as a cross between what was found in the original Oblivion and the process players saw in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s a new design for a sewer grate or a game-changing addition, the insurmountable number of tweaks has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake">many players feeling like Oblivion Remastered is more of a remake</a> than a simple fresh coat of paint. The last decade has indeed been polluted by video game remasters that mostly focus on minor visual improvements, but Bethesda is still hesitant to call its Oblivion re-release, which it started working on in 2021, a full-on remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We looked at every part and carefully upgraded it,” Bethesda continued. “But most of all, we never wanted to change the core. It’s still a game from a previous era and should feel like one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know many of our longtime fans will be thrilled to revisit Oblivion and the land of Cyrodiil. But there are also so many who have never played it. We can’t thank you enough for all the support you have given us and our games over the years. Our hope with this remaster is, that no matter who you are, when you step out of the Imperial sewer – you feel like you’re experiencing it for the first time.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">From all of us at Bethesda Game Studios... <a href="https://t.co/AKlUXrmYW5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AKlUXrmYW5</a></p>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1914718584414089525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">out now</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and is also available to play through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/opinion-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-hit-harder-than-skyrim-and-still-does<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ask most gamers who were around for the Xbox 360 and, Red Ring of Death aside, odds are most of them will share a lot of fond memories with you. And The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion generated plenty of those memories for a lot of Xbox 360 owners. I’m one of them. I worked at Official Xbox Magazine at the time, and for whatever reason, the hugely successful port of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to Xbox never quite hooked me. But right from the jump, Oblivion – which was initially planned to be a day-one launch title for the second Xbox – did. We did multiple cover stories on Oblivion leading up to launch – the screenshots alone blew everyone away – and I eagerly volunteered for each trip out to Bethesda in sleepy Rockville, Maryland. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, when it finally came time to review Oblivion – and this is back in the days when exclusive reviews were a common, accepted thing – I again eagerly jumped at the chance. I returned to Rockville one more time and holed up in a conference room in Bethesda’s basement for four days. I spent four consecutive – and glorious – 11-hour days almost literally living in Cyrodiil, spending almost every waking moment inside this stunning, wide-open, next-gen medieval fantasy world. Before I boarded my return flight home, I’d clocked 44 hours prior to penning OXM’s 9.5 out of 10 review of Oblivion, which I wholeheartedly stand by to this day. It was an incredible game, filled with gripping quests (Dark Brotherhood, anyone?), off-the-beaten-path surprises (if you know about the unicorn, you know), and so much more. Because I was playing a submission build at Bethesda – meaning, a mostly finished version of the game on an Xbox 360 debug kit rather than a regular retail console – I had to start over when I got my final boxed disc copy of the game I’d already put about two full real-life days into.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I dropped another 130 hours or so into The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion without hesitation,so it’s probably no surprise to hear that I’m absolutely thrilled it’s been remastered and re-released on modern platforms. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For the younger generation of gamers who grew up on Skyrim, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim first released.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, I’m envious of the whole generation of younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim and thus, that is The Elder Scrolls for them. Because for them, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim released (for the first of many, many times) over 13 years ago – while franchise fans of all ages continue to wait for The Elder Scrolls VI, which is likely another 4-5 years away.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although if I’m being honest, I doubt Oblivion will hit the same way for them as it did for me in March of 2006, because, for starters, it’s a two-decade-old game (side note: shout-out to Bethesda for delivering this week instead of waiting an extra year when Oblivion will hit its far-more-elegant-sounding 20th anniversary instead of just having passed its 19th). Other games have built upon what Oblivion did, including several by Bethesda itself: Fallout 3, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield. And second, it just doesn’t pack the same visual punch that it did in 2006, when I’d argue it was the first true <em>next-gen </em>game of the HD Era ushered in by the Xbox 360. Obviously the remaster looks better than the original release – that’s the point, of course – but it doesn’t stand head and shoulders above nearly every other game as something that you’ve never seen before. By definition – or at least in practice – remasters aim to make an older game look modern on current platforms. It’s a sharp contrast to a proper remake a la Resident Evil, which carries the expectation of starting from scratch and, in turn, looking as good or better than anything else on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the right game at the right time. By taking full advantage of HD televisions and expanding the scope and scale of what gamers could expect from an open-world game, it was a punch in the face to console gamers who, up to that point, had spent their entire gaming lives seeing their interactive worlds through an interlaced 640x480 television. (Although speaking of punches in the face, prior to Oblivion’s March release, in February 2006, EA released Fight Night Round 3, which was jaw-droppingly gorgeous itself.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My memories of Oblivion are plenty, as it was a world with so much to discover and so much to do. For first-time Oblivion players, let me give you a recommendation: either blast through the main quest as quickly as possible, or save it until you’ve exhausted every last sidequest or open-world activity. Why? Well, the Oblivion gates will start randomly spawning and pestering you once you start down that main questline’s path, so for my money it’s best to seal them off straight away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, the technological leap made from Morrowind to Oblivion might not ever happen again – though I suppose if we wait long enough for The Elder Scrolls 6, maybe it will. But at the very least, playing Oblivion Remastered won’t present such a staunch difference from any release of Skyrim, and for that I suppose those same younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim won’t get what I had. But no matter if you’re playing Oblivion for the first time or you’ve clocked hundreds of hours with it, its fully realized medieval fantasy world and the surprises and adventures contained within it have always made it my favorite Elder Scrolls game. And I’m thrilled it’s back, even if its surprise release was spoiled many times over before it finally showed up again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Its goal is to remake the 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion entirely within The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's game engine. It's an impressive effort that has been in the works for several years. In February, TESRenewal suggested that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">could be released this year</a>. Shortly thereafter, rumors of an official Oblivion remaster and remake began to swirl.</p><p>As it became clear that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was real and launching soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">Skyblivion Project Lead Rebelzize said</a>, "for the community it's a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year," of the situation. Earlier today, Bethesda and Virtuos officially announced and released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Rather than issuing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-later-60fps-bloodborne-patch-gets-taken-down-by-sony/1100-6529174/" data-ref-id="1100-6529174">cease and desist</a> for Skyblivion, Bethesda acknowledged the team's work and provided the members of TESRenewal with free codes for the remaster.</p><p>Skyblivion is expected to be released sometime in 2025 and will be available on PC to owners of Skyrim: Special Edition, the original Oblivion, and its DLCs.
