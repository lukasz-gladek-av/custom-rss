            <p>
GTA 5 will no longer be part of the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium games catalogue offering as of the middle of next month, as the countdown continues to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar's hugely-popular open world is now listed among the games labelled as being your "Last chance to play", visible from your PlayStation console.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has spotted a dozen games set to depart the service on 18th June, with other top picks including indie adventure Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and sci-fi puzzler The Talos Principle. 
</p>
<p>
The full list of games leaving PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium next month are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons </li>
<li>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace</li>
<li>Dodgeball Academia</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
<li>Indivisible</li>
<li>Monster Jam Steel Titans </li>
<li>MotoGP 23 </li>
<li>SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated </li>
<li>The Talos Principle: Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>The Wild at Heart</li>

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-leads-decembers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-catalogue-additions">GTA 5 was only added to the PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium catalogue relatively recently</a> - on 19th December 2023 - so its tenure has lasted just six months. 
</p>
<p>
Its arrival marked a flurry of fresh activity in the decade-old game, as the countdown began to the long, long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">GTA 6 - now set to launch in autumn 2025</a>. None of this has stopped GTA 5 from continuing to shift yet more copies, of course - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">now passed another staggering sales milestone</a>.

		<p>I’ve found a renewed love for Overwatch 2 this week, and as such I’ve been spending more time than is healthy in competitive matchmaking. What it has taught me is that if someone else plays as Moira I don’t really know how to play any other support characters. Then everything goes to hell. Still, I’ve mostly been having fun. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> for review, and dipping into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/the-arrival-of-monster-hunter-stories-on-playstation-and-pc-finally-puts-the-series-in-one-place/">Monster Hunter Stories 1+2</a> as well.</p>
<p>Firstly, this week is a big one for one of our News Editors, <strong>Aran</strong>, as he is getting married tomorrow! Huge congratulations, and we wish you all the best on your special day from all of us at TSA!</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> is not getting married, instead deciding to wrap up the Thieves Guild quests in Skyrim and turning his sights towards The Dark Brotherhood. He says, “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my return to The Elder Scrolls series and now have a deep longing to play Oblivion.” He continued, “While I would say that starting another open-world game would be foolish, that’s exactly what I’ve done with Death Stranding. Having abandoned it soon after launch, I felt like I jumped off just before things we’re about to get good. In some ways that’s true – I’ve now surpassed where I was on my original playthrough, and have access to progression unlocks that make the game less of a chore, no doubt bolstered by some post-launch content and QoL improvements. With a sequel on the way, I’m definitely going to stick with it, even if I’m also juggling Ghost of Tsushima which – I’m happy to report – plays nicely on Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/crown-wars-the-black-prince-review/">Crown Wars: The Black Prince for review,</a> and you can check out his thoughts right now! Otherwise, he’s been maintaining his pirate empire in Skull of Bones. He tells us, “Gotta say, I’m still thoroughly enjoying the game and am genuinely excited for Season 2 dropping next week! Oh, and I’ve been playing some Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, fantastic blockbuster action game, if that’s your kind of thing the game does not disappoint!”</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Capes, an XCOM style superhero game, as well as Diablo IV, and Baldur’s Gate 3. Meanwhile, <strong>Nick P</strong> has seemingly played a bit of everything. Stellar Blade, Helldivers 2, Dead by Daylight, Street Fighter 6 and Killer Klowns from Outer Space for review next week.</p>
<p>Rounding things out for the week, <strong>Tef</strong> polished off a review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, loving the ability to play the GameCube classic on Switch, and that’s before the lovely makeover in a new engine. He also hopped into some matches of Killer Klowns with Nick and Steve to help fill out the server.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p>
The developer of MultiVersus has gone "above and beyond" to ensure the game is protected from dataminers.
</p>
<p>
The free-to-play fighter is out next week and includes villains like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-files-point-to-mark-hamill-as-the-joker">The Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-the-matrix-is-coming-to-multiversus">Agent Smith from The Matrix</a>, both of which were rumoured long before their reveals.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems the developer has put stronger defences in place to protect the game from future dataminers, though there's no guarantee there won't be further leaks.

<p>
MultiVersus director Tony Huynh told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/multiversus-director-says-dataminers-do-a-disservice-to-the-players/">VGC</a> that datamining is a "disservice to the players" as they "don't get the grand reveal that we have planned".
</p>
<p>
"It is an arms race, so it'll be constant protections against new and creative ways to datamine," said Huynh. "At the end of the day, we've done a lot, we've learned a lot, but again, it is an arms race.
</p>
<p>
"I can't promise that there won't ever be leaks or anything like that. But on our end, we've done, I think, above and beyond what industry standards and protections there are.
</p>
<p>
"That being said, everyone's very creative and they're... they're just very, very smart. We're reacting, and we put a lot of stuff in place, but I'm just continuously impressed by their level of ability to get through things."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "I think it's a disservice to the players, honestly, that these things are ruined, and it's deflating for the team as well.
</p>
<p>
"But more importantly, it's - I wouldn't use the word 'depressing' - it's just unfortunate for the players. They don't get the grand reveal that we have planned, and a lot of the air is sucked out of the room."
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus held an open beta last year, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">closed ahead of a full release</a>. That's happening next week across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.

</p>
<p>
Ahead of the release, developer Player First Games has detailed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-multiversus-beta-players-will-receive-free-premium-battle-pass">season one premium battle pass</a>, which will be available for free for players returning from the beta. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th</a> is the main draw.

			<p>The <a href="https://roguetrader.owlcat.games/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> DLC expansion called Void Shadows is launching this August, introducing 15 hours of new content to the massive cRPG developed by Owlcat Games.</p>
<p>The Void Shadows expansion, which launches on August 8th, will allow players to delve into the depths of their voidship to fight a new enemy that is trying to bring down the von Valacious dynasty from the inside. The expansion will add two new archetypes with unique abilities, new lore content, a new companion, the Death Cult Assassin Kibellah, new crew members, new locations, and more. All the content will be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign, so it will be possible to bring the new companion along in base campaign's quests and use the new archetypes freely.</p>

<p>Even with the Void Shadows DLC expansion, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a massive cRPG filled to the brim with content. While prior knowledge of the Warhammer 40,000 universe makes it more enjoyable, the game does its best to introduce newcomers to the universe created by Games Workshop, although a lack of innovation and some frustrating mechanics do hold the experience back a bit, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun. However, while the lack of innovation isn't a major setback thanks to its high-quality campaign, the presence of bugs and frustrating mechanics prevents it from being a must-have for all RPG enthusiasts, limiting its appeal beyond Warhammer 40,000 and Owlcat Games fans.</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p><span>A gallery of weathered posters from the start of Death of the Outsider.</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p><em>Following a devastating winter and spring for the games industry, and a lot of dismal rhetoric from publishers and platform holders, Rob and Patrick try and reckon with what the future holds for the kinds of games and experiences they have always loved... and maybe the entire concept of commercial art.</em></p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Hey Rob, earlier this week I finally put the finishing touches <a href="https://remapradio.com/other/i-burned-myself-out-playing-a-game-i-love/" rel="noreferrer">on Final <em>Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em></a>, the second installment in a trilogy (!!) of remakes/sequels to a video game from 1997. It’s been 27 years since I played that original game. So much has happened since then in my life, not the least of which includes the death of my father and the birth of my two children. I’m nearly 40, but still don’t have gray hair. The video game industry has also changed radically, too, with different power brokers entering and leaving, and the form of the devices we play on undergoing radical shifts along the way. But for all that supposed change, nearly 30 years later, I’m still playing a story about a guy named Cloud and a girl named Aeris—sorry, <em>Aerith</em>—and it makes me wonder: how often do radical shifts end up feeling less radical with some distance?</p><p>I say this because on a recent podcast, we collectively wondered whether some of the games we like to play are going away. Thousands have been laid off and dozens of studios shuttered. There are unknowable numbers of games that you and I probably would have loved that we’ll never actually play, because their developers will never get a chance to ship them. What the industry is going through at the moment is, undeniably, <em>change</em>. I just don’t know what’s on the other end of it, and for as rocky as it feels, isn’t there a good chance it looks remarkably similar?</p><p>Who’s going to make the next immersive sim? Arkane Austin isn’t going to make another <em>Prey</em>, but this year, we were also treated to a loving <em>System Shock</em> remake. <em><u>Deathloop</u></em> wasn’t that long ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gaming-is-on-the-verge-of-an-immersive-sim-eruption?ref=remapradio.com"><u>and indies have taken up the design torch with gusto</u></a>. It feels like we’ve poured one out for the immersive sim at least a dozen times, during the eras of Waypoint and Remap.</p><p>Inevitably, are we collectively playing out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjKZzKLpNII&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>“that gum you like is going to come back in style”?</u></a></p><p>There <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was an interesting data point going around recently</u></a> about how the most played video games in 2023 were, broadly, old. Games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, and others dominated, with precious few “new” games managing to sneak in. Strange days, surely, but if <em>Fortnite</em> is the avenue for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137577/fortnite-festival-rock-band-4-controllers?ref=remapradio.com"><u>a <em>Rock Band </em>resurrection</u></a>, praise be. But it’s also incredibly scary if you’re a player of a certain age, because you can easily look at that data and tell yourself a story that ostracizes your interests with a few more demographic shifts.</p><p>I don’t know what to make of it. I also can’t help but wonder if, 10 years on, it’ll look shockingly similar to right now, just as Square Enix begins to roll out its three-part <em>Chrono Trigger</em> remake, and we’re watching someone present their new take on a game directly inspired by <em>Dishonored</em>.</p><p>So I put the question to you: how do you feel you, and the games you play, fit in this landscape?</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The December 1995 issue of Computer Gaming World, back when the Wing Commander Franchise commanded some of the biggest budgets in games.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>On the one hand, I think you are right that the future will look an awful lot like the present: an industry that is declining and stagnating, yet managing to bring forth flourishing crops of great games. On the other hand, the cycle of boom and bust can still have an overarching trend, the same way you can still get bitterly cold winters against a backdrop of global heating. I think that barring some major, transformative changes to business models, the future of the games industry will almost certainly be&nbsp; less interesting, less original, and less sustainable than it was in the past. It will also keep finding ways to produce the kind of stuff we’re worried will go away.</p><p>I bring this up a lot, but developer Greg Costikyan gave two famous GDC rants a decade apart, each producing impending doom for the industry. The 2004 speech is <a href="https://boingboing.net/2005/03/11/game-developers-amaz.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>absolutely scorched earth</u></a>: at one point he said, “Iwata-san has the heart of a gamer, and my question is what poor bastard's chest did he carve it from?” This speech doesn’t think there’s such a thing as a “good suit”, putting it at odds with a decade of deferential and even fawning treatment of industry leaders from players and parts of the press.</p><p>But here’s the real crux of his argument:</p><blockquote>Who was at the Microsoft keynote? I don't know about you but it made my flesh crawl. The HD era? Bigger, louder? Big bucks to be made! Well not by you and me of course. Those budgets and teams ensure the death of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>…My friends, we are <em>fucked</em>. We are well and truly fucked. The bar in terms of graphics and glitz has been raised and raised until we can't afford to do anything at all. 80 hour weeks until our jobs are all outsourced to Asia. But it's ok because the HD era is here right? I say, enough. The time has come for revolution! It may seem to you that what I describe is inevitable forces of history, but no, we have free will! EA could have chosen to focus on innovation, but they did not. Nintendo could make development kits cheaply available to small firms, but they prefer to rely on the creativity of one aging designer. You have choices, too: work in a massive sweatshop publisher-run studio with thousands of others making the next racing game with the same gameplay as Pole Position. Or you can riot in the streets of Redwood City! Choose another business model, development path, and you can choose to remember why you love games and make sure in a generation's time there are still games to love.</blockquote><p>Electrifying stuff! And you read it and there’s a lot here that he was right about… but then you think about how much amazing stuff came out between this rant and his next one in 2014 where he revisited these themes. </p><p>People who believe strongly in the inherent wisdom of markets and their power to give people what they want, and who see that forces of progress (technical or otherwise) often open up opportunities and innovation in seemingly moribund fields, will see these discrepancies and argue that the doomsayers were wrong. The world didn’t end, it got better!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it brings up "ethical issues we need to address."</h2></div><section><p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has said AI will "revolutionize" video game development process, but cautioned that the controversial technology has “ethical issues.”</p><p>Druckmann, Studio Head and Head of Creative at The Last of Us and Uncharted developer Naughty Dog, issued the comment as part of a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony-published interview</a> on the company’s ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.’ Druckmann was asked how he envisions the “fusion of storytelling and technology evolving over the next 10 years” as part of a Sony series that also revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-might-a-playstation-controller-look-like-10-years-from-now-sony-has-an-idea">an idea for a futuristic PlayStation controller</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/the-last-of-us-1716544738405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Part I. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s Druckmann’s response in full:</p><blockquote>We're seeing this exciting marriage of cutting-edge technology with traditional storytelling that's pushing us into a future where enhanced fidelity isn't just about achieving realism, but about broadening the spectrum from highly stylized visuals to ultra-realistic ones. This broadening of possibilities is fueled by increasingly accessible tools that allow even non-technical people to use their imagination and create worlds and narratives to their heart's content.</blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles.</blockquote><p>Later in the interview Druckmann said AI will let Naughty Dog "create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities," but insisted it was "crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes."</p><p>"I emphasize mastering fundamentals over tools; with AI, your creativity sets the limits," Druckmann said. "Understanding art history, composition, and storytelling is essential for effective direction. Tools evolve quickly — some tools once essential, now are obsolete. At Naughty Dog, we transitioned from hand-animating 'Jak and Daxter' to using motion capture in 'Uncharted', significantly enhancing our storytelling. AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities. However, it's crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Tools evolve quickly — some tools once essential, now are obsolete.</p></div><p>Druckmann’s comments have caused a stir online, particularly within the video game community where the impact of AI is perhaps the hottest topic. Developers and gamers have expressed concern about the use of AI to replace everything from voice acting to narrative design, but executives have continued to push it hard, telling the investment community it will fundamentally change how video games are made and, as Druckmann alludes to, cut costs.</p><p>As part of the same Sony series, head of PlayStation Productions and head of Product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything">weighed in on AI</a> to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers who seek "personalization across everything." </p><p>"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p>Earlier this month, EA boss Andrew Wilson told the investment community that “more than 50% of our development processes will be positively impacted by the advances in generative AI.” Wilson, who oversees EA Sports FC, The Sims, and BioWare games, added that AI will make game development “more efficient”, revealing that the EA Sports FC developers can now make stadiums in six weeks rather than six months.</p><p>The Witcher voice actor Doug Cockle also expressed caution and frustration at the growing presence of AI within the video game industry, calling it "inevitable" but "dangerous." Ironically, however, the biggest developer to use AI for voice acting so far is The Witcher studio CD Projekt Red, though this was only done <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-developer-cd-projekt-used-ai-to-replace-deceased-voice-actor-with-familys-permission"><u>to replace a deceased voice actor after gaining permission from the family</u></a>.</p><p>In March, video game support developer Keywords Studios <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent">tried to create a game solely using artificial intelligence but failed</a> because the technology was "unable to replace talent.”</p><p>"One of the key learnings was that whilst Gen AI may simplify or accelerate certain processes, the best results and quality needed can only be achieved by experts in their field utilising Gen AI as a new, powerful tool in their creative process," Keywords said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Druckmann interview, the Last of Us director <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming">teased Naughty Dog’s new game</a>, saying it "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
The developer behind new gacha adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a> has apologised for the number of bugs and lag issues at launch.
</p>
<p>
The game launched worldwide yesterday (UK time) but has already seen multiple hotfixes, the latest of which forced an uninstall and reinstall of the game, Eurogamer can confirm.
</p>
<p>
An English post on X from Chinese developer Kuro Games has acknowledged the situation and promised players compensation of ten Lustrous Tides - essentially gacha pulls for new characters and weapons. Further, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cz0ua9/wuwa_dev_apology/">BiliBili post in Chinese</a> includes a fully apology.

"We have identified some issues that have impacted your gaming experience and are now actively working on solutions," wrote the developer. "We are committed to constant self-reflection and improvement, with your satisfaction as our top priority. We are incredibly grateful for your understanding and patience during our recent technical issues."

Further, a <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777">news post on the game's website</a> details a list of known issues. That includes a login timeout issue that's supposedly been fixed, issues of age authentication in certain areas, and needing to repeatedly log in when the game client is relaunched on PC.

</p>
<p>
The post also acknowledges localisation quality and performance issues. "We have received feedback regarding the localisation quality of the game," it reads. "Ensuring high-quality localisation has always been a priority for us, and we are fully committed to improving it. Currently, our team is endeavouring to continuously rectify and optimise the localised texts to provide an enjoyable experience for Rovers everywhere. Fixes to some of the known issues with the current localised texts will be included in the patches to be released soon."

In the meantime, fans have been sharing posts on the game's subreddit to show the current state of the game, including the below lag issues.

            <p>Activision have celebrated my birthday in the traditional manner by announcing a new Call Of Duty game. Said Call Of Duty game is Black Ops 6, "a dark new chapter" in the Treyarch-helmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> sub-series which is known for seedier and weirder, alt-historical or post-future stories featuring hallucinations and cybernetics and catchy period music.</p> <!--more-->
<p>What do we know right now about Black Ops 6? Friend, right now I can tell you little other than that the logo art appears to feature a wolf wearing the Capitol building as a hat. Please let this not be my weary end-of-week projection. Please let this be evidence that Black Ops 6's major antagonist (or protagonist?) is a wolf so vast it is obliged to clothe itself in major US landmarks. Perhaps it could wear the Pentagon as a diaper? Ho ho ho I slay myself. Please let this be evidence that Black Ops 6 is secretly a Bayonetta game. Hitting a giga-wolf over the noggin with the Capitol building is absolutely a thing Bayonetta would do. You can keep your silly tactical nukes, Mason.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>2024's Call Of Duty will get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-2024-and-gears-6-to-get-june-reveal-alongside-avowed-and-indiana-jones-release-dates-claims-report">a proper reveal at Summer Games Fest</a>, and is the subject of many a rumour. For example, the game will reportedly be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-launch-on-game-pass-on-day-one-reports-say">the first Call Of Duty to launch on Game Pass</a>, which one former Microsoft employee has described as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead">essential</a> if the subscription service is to do numbers of sufficient magnitude to offset Microsoft's recent billion-dollar inhalation of Activision-Blizzard. It's also rumoured to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-is-a-black-ops-game-set-during-the-first-gulf-war-according-to-reports">set during the events of the first Gulf War</a>.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I have emotions about Call Of Duty these days, Black Ops is the aspect of the FPS juggernaut I have the greatest fondness for. It's as basically batshit and half-cocked in its representation of war and history as the Modern Warfare series, but Black Ops at least has the courtesy to be openly batshit and half-cocked rather than making reference to authenticity and fidelity. A giga-wolf would fit in perfectly here, Activision. Make it so. Come on, it's my birthday.</p>

            <p>The Asus ROG Ally X, a sort of semi-sequel to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a> handheld PC, has had its specs spilled over at <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-x-specs-leaked-24gb-lpddr5x-7500-memory-and-massive-80-wh-battery">Videocardz</a>. I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James <em>wants</em> to be true."</p>

<p>It's not as wide-ranging a refresh as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> was to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, as the ROG Ally X will apparently keep the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU that powered the original model. The display also appears unchanged, sticking with a 7in, 1920x1080 IPS panel with 500cd/m2 peak brightness. But that new battery could be a major improvement, given how quickly the ROG Ally runs out of juice (and how unbefitting that lack of stamina is for a portable device).</p>
<p>The leak also lists a RAM upgrade to 24GB of LPDDR5, running at 7500MHz. Ye olde ROG Ally was no memory slouch, packing 16GB of LPDDR5 at 6400MHz, but that extra capacity and bandwidth might well produce performance upgrades; remember that with an all-in-one APU, memory is shared among the central processor and the GPU, so the latter is getting an indirect power boost.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> slot has also been moved away from the lower air vent, hopefully avoiding further cases of overheating that ROG Ally owners have occasionally grappled with. The more surprising storage change, though, is the listed support for M.2 2280 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSDs</a> – the same kind you likely have in your desktop PC, rather the smaller, more expensive, less widely available <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">M.2 2230 drives</a> currently used by the ROG Ally and Steam Deck.</p>

</figure>
<p>All this added bigness has, inevitably, forced an increase in the ROG Ally X’s proportions. It will weigh 678g (up from 608g; the Steam Deck OLED weighs 640g) and measure 36.9mm across, so it’s gained 4.5mm of thickness. That’s still not as chunky as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, mind. Or as weighty.</p>
<p>Expect confirmation of the ROG Ally X’s specs and pricing at Computex, Taiwan’s computing-focused tech trade show of renown, on June 2nd. Word is it will release the same month, too.</p>
<p>I like the sound of all these changes, at least for a refresh – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-vs-asus-rog-ally">battery chugging</a> was one of the original ROG Ally’s two biggest issues, and while I’m a Steam Deck OLED convert these days, there was nothing about the ROG Ally’s display or performance that seemed in drastic need of upgrades. It was also slim and light enough that the new design’s modest bulk additions surely can’t spoil it.</p>
<p>That said, its <em>second</em> biggest issue was the fiddliness of using Windows 11 on a small screen with no onboard trackpads, and for all of SteamOS’s occasional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-really-really-doesnt-want-to-run-on-steam-deck">compatibility headaches</a>, it’s still just a much more welcoming software experience than what the ROG Ally has ever offered. Asus actually have confirmed a new replacement for the Ally’s games launcher app, ROG Pulse (formerly Armory Crate), but I’m still waiting to be convinced that this and/or the ROG Ally X itself will fully address the underlying mismatch between OS and hardware.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-6-release-may-be-closer-than-expected-%E2%80%9Cyin-and-yang%E2%80%9D-theme-teased-by-placeholder-logo.880308/</guid>

			<p>Persona 6 may not be too far off from release, as it has already been in development for a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Well-known ATLUS/SEGA leaker Midori shared today on X/Twitter the game's <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1793762106539684126">placeholder logo</a>, similar to Persona 5's placeholder which hinted at some of the game's themes. Alongside revealing the logo and suggesting the game will have some sort of <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1793797161336926704">"Yin and Yang" theme</a>, the leaker also revealed the sixth entry in the series has entered <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1793866862905958854">full production</a> before all the recently released entries in the series, such as Persona 3 Reload and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, so it is likely not too far from release, despite not having been officially announced yet.</p>
<p>Persona 6's "opposites" theme isn't exactly surprising, as another leaker talked about the game having a <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-6-dual-story-playstation-exclusive/">dual sides story</a> earlier this year. One of the characters, however, won't be playable in dungeons. The game is supposedly also employing a semi-open-world formula that should give players more freedom than in previous entries.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Persona 3 Reload, remake of the third entry in the series which introduced many of the features that define the series today. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">review.</a></p>
<p>Persona 6 has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
Infused with Mad Max-y vibes, Fortnite's new season is here - bringing with it the game's Fallout crossover. 
</p>
<p>
We knew to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-fallouts-power-armour-in-fortnite">expect the Fallout T-60 Power Armour</a>, and now know the iconic suit is its own skin in the game, not a power-up. Joining it are a range of other punky wasteland warriors, Magneto from the X-Men, and a character named Peabody that's a pod of... peas.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of power-ups, Fallout's Nuka-Cola is available for you to chug as a health power-up, while the new Nitro power-up will buff both you (your speed, knockback, stamina rate, reload speed and fall damage immunity) and your vehicle (speed, ramming power, fuel consumption, attack mods).

<p>
Vehicles look to be playing a key part this season, with returning car mods and a suite of new add-ons that allow you to attach miniguns and grenade launchers to trucks, and upgrade to unpoppable bulletproof tyres. There's also an armoured battle bus to find and drive.
</p>
<p>
Peeking behind the scenes, datamines show a raft of things to come later this season which haven't yet been announced, such as returning pirate-themed items such as the Treasure Map and Pirate Cannon, set to return as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">part of a Pirates of the Caribbean crossover</a>, plus a character skin for Lethal Company. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's servers remain offline for the time being while the new season is readied. Here's hoping things get going quicker than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-launch-delayed-due-to-last-minute-snag">last season's delayed launch</a>.

            <p>Skulls! You’ve got one. I’ve got one. Everybody has a lovely skull keeping their lovely face right where it should be. Warhammer is big, so it needs must have multiple of them, hence their yearly event Skulls, which collates a bunch of Games Workshop related announcements into a sort of bizzaro world Nintendo Direct if Yoshi was actually a parasitic corpse emperor. There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus</a>. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.</p>

<p>You can check out the whole thing above, but here’s a happy little summary for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus is getting a numbered sequel. The first one was an excellent turn-based jaunt through Necron tombs as a crew of the titular cyborg popes. It was a little <em>too</em> easy on release, but they soon sorted that out with patches.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> is getting a free legendary hero in the form of Karanak: the hound of vengeance. Calling your dog ‘the hound of vengeance’ is asking for trouble, if you ask me. Also, you’ll sound like tit calling its name, but I suppose Khorne cares not.</li>
<li>We got some new details for Void Shadows,  the next expansion for big talky RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>. It’s got a new romanceable companion, alongside other, less romanceable things</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> are getting updates.</li>
<li>Great boomy shooty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Boltgun</a> is getting an expansion named ‘Forges of Corruption’</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> has a <a href="https://youtu.be/jjqYQZxwi-E">new trailer</a> looking into the multiplayer. Everyone gets to be Spice Maureens now!</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew, that was a lot of skulls. Was there an Indiana Jones scene where he’s wading through skulls or am I imagining that? Either way, that’s how I feel. Just swimming through a sea of skulls. If you need a new skull, let me know, because I’ve got loads of them. While you’re waiting for all this newness to materialise, why not have a look at our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review">Boltgun review</a>. It’s a great time, say I. Caelyn Ellis agrees, writing “It’s a highly entertaining shooter that had me grinning from ear to ear on many an occasion, and is one of, if not the best representation of the Warhammer 40,000 universe available on your personal cogitation device.”</p>

Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).</p>
<p>BioWare's first ever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

<p>
For a while, Larian thought about rebuilding Candlekeep in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which begins many years later. And who better to take us through those plans, as we reckon with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">the acquisition of Gamer Network</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ABeeWords/status/1792957956599972173">the departure of our incredible deputy editor Alice Bell</a>, than an old friend of RPS - one of the site's own former sages, Baldur's Gate 3's lead writer and our deputy editor till 2019, Adam Smith.

<p>
I spoke to Adam about Candlekeep following a characteristically illuminating and uncorporate presentation about Baldur's Gate 3's writing at this year's Digital Dragon's conference in Krakow. Some highlights from that presentation: "the sausage of sadness", a Larian term for when dialogue writing leads the player into a dead-end, and an audience participation element in which Adam asked people to decide whether various Baldur's Gate 3 romance scenes qualify as sex from the perspective of Youtube content guidelines, which amongst other things is the first time I have seen the other kind of sausage screened at a videogames conference, to say nothing of cunnilingus and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrZgnidmYUc">whatever the hell Gale is doing in this scene</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Adam had many additional insights of the sexalicious persuasion when I spoke to him later. Brace yourselves for them once I have worked out what to do with them. In the meantime: the question of Candlekeep in Baldur's Gate 3. "I had a bunch of ideas for it," Adam explained. "I think that it's a good setting, partly because it's going back to where it all began. So that was always compelling. But also because you get an academic dungeon, and there's something interesting about that kind of library dungeon. It's vast, you know, within the lore. And the idea of having this place where you need to go to do research or something, or you need to go down into it. And then you also say, well, this is where the Bhaalspawn was raised - you know, it's very, very attractive." 
</p>

<p>
I'm a fan of enormous, sinister archives myself. I'm pretty sure I own enough books to fill a dungeon of at least three levels, though one would be stocked exclusively with crumbling GSCE poetry anthologies. So why isn't Candlekeep in Baldur's Gate 3? 
</p>
<p>
"The biggest problem was that geographically, it's on the way to Baldur's Gate," Adam continued. "So it's like, are we going to stop on the way there? Are we going to go in and then come back out again, how are we going to position it like that? The game went through a lot of different variations - one of them had you go into Baldur's Gate, and then come back out again. And then pacing-wise, it was a problem, because you have the escalation of Act 2 and the climax there. And then we're like, OK, do we, what do we want to do now? And actually, what we wanted to do was get to the city." 
</p>
<p>
Some additional context for our interview: at the time, I was in the process of learning about Gamer Network's acquisition. As a consequence, I was a bit shellshocked and wobbling all over the shop with my lines of inquiry. Fortunately, Adam had come to our chat with his very own Baldur's Gate party consisting of Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who chimed in companion-dialogue style with a follow-up question. (To be clear for the benefit of any higher-ups reading, I kept my mouth shut about the acquisition during our conversation, which is a missed opportunity - given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">his past comments about games industry layoffs</a>, I'd have been interested to get Vincke's take on the current state of gaming media). 
</p>
<p>
"Do you remember all the stuff, all the crazy shit that you put in there?" Vincke asked Adam. "Yeah, yeah, there was a lot of crazy shit," said Adam. "There was the seer of the Far Realms. Yeah, I remember it all. Yeah."
</p>
<p>
"Because you were being very vague," Vincke pressed, journalistically. To which Adam responded: "Well, remember what I said about recycling your darlings."
</p>
<p>
("Recycling your darlings" is the redemptive Smith version of the popular creative mantra "Kill your darlings", aka ideas you love but which are fundamentally impractical and absorbing too much time and attention. During his Digital Dragons presentation, Adam illustrated this with an image of a massive pile of corpses. I can't remember if this was before or after he screened the illithid romance scene, which it turns out isn't even real sex in the eyes of Youtube. Sorry, illithidshippers.)
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Vincke's intervention, our musings on Candlekeep were able to continue. "The thing is, if you read the lore on Candlekeep, and actually, Wizards released a book called Candlekeep Mysteries, while we were in development - we got an early copy of that," Adam went on. "And it's like, any world that's full of knowledge is full of forbidden knowledge, and that's very interesting to me instantly. So there's a place in the Forgotten Realms, or the D&amp;D universe, I should say, called the Far Realms. And some of the lore says that's where the mindflayers began - it's the cosmic horror place, you know.
</p>
<p>
"So I had this whole idea that you'd have this seer, who's sitting at the bottom of Candlekeep, who is basically staring into the Far Realms, you know, and has gone completely insane, and you have to go down there and find out what he's seen. I still think it would have been very cool. It's just the pacing for me." 
</p>
<p>
"It's a game in its own right," suggested Vincke, journalistically.
</p>
<p>
"Probably, yeah," Adam continued. "But once you've got to the that key point in Act 2, we could have had a much more dense game after that, but I think that we would have exhausted people. And you know, there's a point where it becomes like, well, is this content for the sake of content? I hate the word 'content', but you know - is it actually adding to the story and the journey I'm on, where I am in my adventure? You can have too many climaxes. They're exhausting as well. I'm not talking about sex again." 
</p>
<p>
Larian have now washed their hands of D&amp;D. They're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-dont-know-what-their-next-game-is-yet-but-it-wont-be-baldurs-gate-4-or-baldurs-gate-3-dlc">not making Baldur's Gate 4</a>, nor are they plotting any further major additions to Baldur's Gate 3. This seems a tragedy - it's hard to imagine anybody devising a better D&amp;D adaptation in the near-future, but it's equally hard to complain when you think about how much BG3 gives you, without (for my money, anyway) overstuffing the pudding. As Alice B <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-review">wrote in our review</a>, "in BG3, there's no baggy excess, but there's also nothing wasted, whether that be space for a joke in a description of some boots, or the chance to give one entirely optional boss his own song about kicking your ass on the soundtrack - which many players won't even hear!" 
</p>
<p>
Still, if Larian <em>do</em> return to D&amp;D at some stage, I can well imagine them cracking the lid on Candlekeep and perhaps, unearthing that maddened seer from the bottom of the labyrinth. "It's where the Baldur's Gate story began," Adam concluded. "So it's always going to be in your head, you know?"

<p data-characters="313" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Chapter 5 Season 3 of <em>Fortnite</em> will be starting later today, and Epic Games has already confirmed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-is-teasing-a-fallout-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new crossovers with Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> series</a> and Marvel’s X-Men. However, another crossover skin has leaked ahead of a formal announcement, and it’s honestly the most exciting one: <em>Lethal Company</em>.</p> <p data-characters="647" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">While not officially confirmed, frequent and reliable <em>Fortnite</em> leakers <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793902842681638976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1793903005546520666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> on Twitter shared a render of a skin based on the playable employee characters from <em>Lethal Company</em> earlier today. They also posted a short in-game clip of the skin in the <em>Fortnite</em> Locker, which shows that there’ll be <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793916464262738162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a <em>Lethal Company</em> inspired emote</a> as well; one based on the little dance you use to communicate with other players. It’s not yet clear if these cosmetics will be available at launch for the new season, or if they’ll be added a little further down the line. They’re certainly not part of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-fortnite-wrecked-season-3-battle-pass-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the season’s battle pass</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true"><em>Lethal Company</em> was easily one of the biggest surprises of 2023. This indie co-op survival horror game almost came out of nowhere in October, but managed to dominate Steam, becoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lethal-company-is-now-the-top-selling-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the top-selling game on the platform</a> the following month and eventually accruing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/co-op-horror-game-lethal-company-hits-over-100k-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100,000 concurrent players</a>. We even named it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoids-award-for-best-indie-game-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best indie game of 2023</a>, beating out the likes of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-el-paso-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">El Paso, Elsewhere</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-world-of-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Horror</a></em>, and it’s not even a complete game; it’s still in early access.</p>
 <p data-characters="660" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">So, it’s not as if it needs the validation; its success speaks for itself. But given <em>Fortnite</em> has primarily stuck to major IPs and famous celebrities for its crossovers, <em>Lethal Company</em> getting its own cosmetics in the battle royale feels like a big deal. Aside from <em>Among Us</em> (which similarly exploded in popularity and became a viral sensation), I can’t think of any other one-off indie games to make a <em>Fortnite</em> appearance. Admittedly, though, <em>Lethal Company</em> probably would’ve been overlooked if it wasn’t massively popular to begin with, so this shouldn’t be taken as a sign that Epic Games will put any indie game into <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="753" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="false">However, this is the first time in a long while that one of these crossovers has been a genuine surprise. <em>Fortnite</em>‘s had so many of them that, at this point, every other crossover has felt predictable. Of course there’d be <em>Fallout</em> skins, especially after the success of the TV show. Of course there’d be a Magneto skin in the wake of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/x-men-97s-astonishing-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>X-Men ’97</em>‘s season finale</a>. Even that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/leaker-claims-fortnite-could-get-major-kingdom-hearts-crossover/">rumoured <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> crossover</a> wouldn’t be that surprising. Could any of us have predicted a <em>Lethal Company</em> skin though? It almost makes me wonder if any other breakout indie successes might be considered for <em>Fortnite</em> collaborations. <em>Hollow Knight</em>? <em>Hades</em>? <em>Vampire Survivors</em>? Honestly, when it comes to <em>Fortnite</em>, it feels nothing is off-limits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avalanche-studio-founder-opens-up-on-2015s-mad-max-development-blames-warner-bros-for-canceled-dlc-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avalanche Studio's founder Christofer Sundberg has taken to X to express his discontent about recent quotes from Mad Max director George Miller.</p>
<p>Yesterday, PC Gamer published an article about Miller and the director wanting Hideo Kojima to make a proper Mad Max game. In addition, the director revealed that he wasn't that happy with 2015's Mad Max game from developer Avalanche. "We've been asked many many times to do one", Miller said. "It wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, it wasn't in our hands, we gave all our material to a company to do it… but I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level, or at least try to make it at the highest level."</p>
<p>After the publication of this article, Sundberg was quick to respond on X, saying that Miller's words show "complete arrogance". "This is complete nonsense and just shows complete arrogance", the Avalanche founder wrote on X. "They did everything they could to make this a complete linear game after having signed up with a developer of open-world games. I'm sure Hideo Kojima would make an awesome Mad Max game, but it would be a completely different experience."</p>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1793612777648689221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued</a>, "After the first year of development they realized that they had forced us to make a linear experience rather than the open world game we pitched. We threw away a year of work and got to hear that "players wants autonomy in this day and age". Well, no shit..."</p>
<p>Sundberg is referring to publisher Warner Bros., which, apparently, insisted that Mad Max was released alongside Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. In addition, Sundberg revealed that the team had "awesome DLC" sitting to be released, but following bad sales of the game, these DLCs were canceled.</p>
<p>He said, "As we were forced to release Mad Max on the same day as MGS, they blamed us for the bad sales and cancelled a bunch of awesome DLC that was just sitting there waiting to be released."</p>
<p>In all honesty, the 2015 Mad Max game is a highly underrated title that deserves praise. For those interested, it can be picked up pretty cheap on PC and consoles right now. Here's what we wrote about the 2015 title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mad-max-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> back then:</p>
<p><em>It’s still a game I really, truly enjoy. The open world may not be the most interesting, the characters may not be all that memorable, and the quests might not exactly be inspired, but this is a very competent game made by an obviously talented team of developers (Avalanche Studios; you know them for Just Cause) and they honestly blew my expectations for a Mad Max game out of the water. My gripes ultimately feel minor, because the game as a whole is very satisfying and fun to play, save for a few of those more menial challenges.</em></p>

        <p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill would also enable sideloading third-party apps on mobile platforms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill has been passed by UK Parliament, which could force platform holders such as Apple and Google to allow the Epic Games Store on its devices.</p>
<p>The DMCC Bill was put through on Thursday following the announcement of a general election set for July 4.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-passes-bill-which-could-force-apple-to-allow-fortnite-and-an-epic-games-store-app-on-ios/">VGC</a>, parts of the DMCC Bill contain sections established in the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-google-under-pressure-as-eu-approves-digital-markets-act">EU's Digital Markets Act</a> passed in November 2022, which would force platform holders to allow users to sideload third-party apps and software onto devices. This also opens up the possibility of alternative marketplaces on these platforms.</p>
<p>Back in January, Apple announced changes that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">would allow alternative app stores and payments on iOS</a> in compliance with the DMA.</p>
<p>By March, Apple, Google and Meta were already<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eu-commission-investigates-google-meta-and-apple-for-possible-digital-markets-act-violations"> under investigation by the EU for potential violations of the DMA</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games is in the process of developing a mobile version of its storefront for Apple's App Store, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Eurogamer</a>, which will launch on iOS sometime this year and will be operated by Epic Games Sweden.</p>

			<p>During the full-year financial report for 2023-24, the Embracer Group confirmed several games that will be released in the next fiscal year (by March 2025), including the Gothic remake, Killing Floor 3 and Titan Quest II. That's in addition to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, which we know will be released in 2024, and three major unannounced games.</p>
<p><em>The announcement of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, an internal IP developed by Warhorse Studios, a PLAION studio based in Prague has been received by players with great enthusiasm. It is an epic open-world medieval RPG set in Bohemia releasing on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox later this year. The title is expected to be one of the key releases in the PC/Console segment in FY 2024/25.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Apart from Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, important new releases in FY 2024/25 include Killing Floor 3, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Hyperlight Breaker, Gothic Remake, and Titan Quest 2, alongside at least three other important, unannounced releases. In total, more than 70 game projects are currently expected to be released during the financial year.</em></p>
<p>The Gothic remake was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development in February 2020, following a demo released on Steam. THQ Nordic founded a brand new studio, the Barcelona-based Alkimia Interactive, to work on the project. Last month, the Collector's Edition became available for pre-order while the developers showcased some new Unreal Engine 5 screenshots of the Gothic remake.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at Gamescom 2023. It's also being made with Unreal Engine 5 at Tripwire Games.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Titan Quest II was <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-as-an-open-world-game-powered-by-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in early August 2023. It will be an open world action RPG made in Unreal Engine 5. It is in development at Grimlore Games, which revealed that players will have to face off against Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution, now out of control. She is corrupting the Threads of Fate and is punishing all those who oppose her. Needless to say, it's up to the player to stop Nemesis.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-a-new-beginning-sales-were-underwhelming-says-embracer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full year financial report for 2023-2024</a>, the Embracer Group revealed that Alone in the Dark sales were underwhelming. The same was said about Outcast: A New Beginning.</p>
<p>Net sales in the last quarter were down 10% year-over-year, largely due to the lower than expected performance of these two games:</p>
<p><em>In Q4, results were also impacted by a softer-than-expected performance for the two titles Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning, developed and published by THQ Nordic.</em></p>
<p><em>Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning both saw a positive reception from users, but a mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.</em></p>
<p>On Wccftech, the Alone in the Dark reboot starring Jodie Comer and David Harbour <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alone-in-the-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned a 7 out of 10 from Nate Birch</a>:</p>
<p><em>Despite my complaints, I have to admit, I still enjoyed this new Alone in the Dark overall. Maybe I’m just a sucker for that old-school survival horror feel, or maybe Alone in the Dark’s faults just didn’t sink in too deeply as no one section of the game sticks around all that long. Your first time through the game will take around 7 or 8 hours, although multiple playthroughs are encouraged in a number of ways. As mentioned, Edward and Emily’s stories aren’t&nbsp;that&nbsp;different, but a variety of collectibles, secrets, and unlockable endings will keep some happily in the dark for a while, although others may feel the urge to flick on the light switch before they collect everything.</em></p>
<p>Outcast: A New Beginning fared far worse (5.5) <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/outcast-a-new-beginning-review-a-mediocre-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Francesco De Meo's review</a>, though:</p>
<p><em>Outcast - A New Beginning is a missed opportunity, abandoning the unique elements of its predecessor for a conventional open-world design that doesn't work well. With uninspired open-world exploration, clunky movement, lackluster combat, and mediocre quest design, it's a hard sell for everyone but Cutter Slade's biggest fans who wish to know how the character's story continues, as there are far superior titles on the market that have executed similar concepts much more effectively.</em></p>
<p>Did you play Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning? If so, what did you think of them?</p>

Following a sandstorm, a new biome was created in the south called wasteland and "Wasteland Warriors" have claimed the area for their own.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked (Fallout, Wasteland Magneto, and More)</h3></div></output><p>You obviously can't have a wasteland without Fallout, and the Wrecked Battle Pass will let you don some T-60 Power Armor after doing a bit of grinding.</p><p>When you purchase the Battle Pass, you will unlock an Outfit called The Machinist. By leveling it up, you will be able to unlock Rust, Peabody, Ringmaster Scarr, and then, finally, the T-60 Power Armor. That's not all, as the Brite Raider and Megalo Don Outfits will become available two levels after that.</p><p>The Fallout fun doesn't end there either, as ice-cold Nuka-Cola bottles will be littered around the map that will restore Health and, over time, a bit of Shield.</p><p>Beyond Fallout, Marvel fans will be delighted to know that they will be able to unlock the Wastelander Magneto Outfit from Battle Pass Quests in July. </p><h2>A Wasteland Waiting to be Conquered</h2><p>Whether you have the T-60 Power Armor or not, the wasteland will have a ton of things to do in it and challenges to conquer. There will also be a few new POIs, including the Redline Rig, Nitrodome, and Brutal Beachhead. All of these are run by different Wasteland Warriors that you'll be able to take down if you dare to try.</p><p>Redline Rig's The Machinist will drop a medallion that will recharge your shield over time and her Mythic weapon, Nitrodome's Ringmaster Scarr will drop a medallion that gives you infinite ammo and a small damage buff alongside a Mythic Ringmaster's Boom Bolt, and Brutal Beachhead's Megalo Don will drop a medallion that will infuse you with infinite Nitro and Megalo Don's Nitro Fists. Oh, and you can steal their vehicles as well.</p><p>Speaking of Nitro, the island will now be home to Nitro Splash and Nitro Barrels that are being shipped right from Redline Rig. Nitro Splash is a portable container that you can throw to infuse your car or yourself with Nitro while Nitro Barrels will fly off when you hit them and explode on whatever it lands on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what Nitro is, it will increase the speed of cars, give "explosive ramming power that deals damage and knockback," decrease fuel consumption, and buff attached attack mods. For the player, it will increase their movement speed, give them the ability to "bust through builds," sprint for longer periods, reload guns faster, and take no fall damage.</p><p>Additionally, there are now Nitro Fists that lets players perform a 3x punch combo, uppercut, or aerial punch. These fists have four charges and each one recharges every eight seconds.</p><p>There is so much more to look forward to in this new season, including a War Bus that you can hijack that comes complete with two cannons and an EMP pulse, new and returning vehicle mods, the ability to create roadblocks with a Boom Bolt, and much more.</p><p>If this isn't enough Fallout for you, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video">our review of Season 1 of the Fallout TV show,</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-tv-series-ending-explained-prime-video">our explainer of its ending,</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-game-you-need-to-play-while-you-wait-for-season-2-new-vegas">the Fallout game you need to play while you wait for Season 2.</a></p><p><em>Have a tip for us?

It’s called “Wrecked,” and it introduces a new wasteland region, a larger focus on vehicular combat, and, for some reason, Magneto.</p><p>First up, let’s talk about the island itself. In the game’s fiction, a massive sandstorm rolled in, completely changing the southern section of the map. There are three new locations: a refinery called Redline Rig, a vehicle arena called Nitrodrome, and a beach area called Brutal Beachhead. To go along with them are “Wasteland Warriors,” which are basically this season’s boss characters, with names like The Machinist and<strong> </strong>Ringmaster Scarr. Also: there are now two War Buses patrolling the island, which players can hijack and take over.</p><p>Here’s the new map:</p><p>It appears there are two main gameplay updates. One is a substance called Nitro, which you can either drink or use on your vehicle: it’ll make players faster, stronger, and reload quicker, while cars will go faster, consume less gas, and be able to ram with increased power. To go along with this, vehicle mods are back, so you can outfit your car with gun turrets, bulletproof tires, and more. And since <em>Fallout</em> is now part of the <em>Fortnite</em> universe, Nuka-Cola is being added to the game. Drinking it will replenish health and slowly build your shield.</p><p>Speaking of <em>Fallout</em>, those who purchase this season’s battle pass will get themselves some T-60 Power Armor, along with other characters, including a sentient pea pod. Starting in July, <em>X-Men</em>’s Magneto will be unlockable as well. Here’s the full crew:</p><p>This season will run until August 16th. And it follows a pretty busy period for the game, which included collaborations with everyone from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148086/may-the-fortnite-be-with-you"><em>Star Wars</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155840/lofi-beats-to-battle-royale-to">Lofi Girl</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After three months of godly gameplay, Fortnite's Myths &amp; Mortals season has come to a close, and the new season, Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked, is imminent. But, for the moment, we're stuck in limbo with Fortnite offline while Epic Games deploys the season update. This is standard procedure--we get at least a few hours of downtime before each new season. It's just a matter of time now.</p><h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Chapter 5 Season 3 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in this year's massive summer season, complete with a major collaboration with Fallout right off the bat, a new desert wasteland-type biome, some kind of new vehicular combat mechanics, and an all-new battle pass full of fresh cosmetics--such as Brotherhood of Steel power armor, which Epic has been teasing all week.</p><p>That Fallout collab is a big one that's got everybody full of hype, but all we can do now is wait until Epic brings Fortnite back online. But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end. Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, May 24--though there have been major exceptions. When this past season began, for example, there was some sort of technical issue that kept the game offline until late in the evening, with Fortnite staying offline for nearly a day. But that was a very unusual situation.</p><p>Once the game does return, Season 3 will introduce a whole host of changes to the battle royale island, thanks to the massive sandstorm that's been coming in from the south. The biggest immediate change will be the introduction of a desert wasteland with several new major locations like the Nitro Drome combat arena, and of course that Fallout collaboration is going to be a big draw for a lot of players, especially after the success of this spring's TV adaptation.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 right here.</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>The Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door doesn’t off up a ton of all-new content, but it does add a pair of tough post-game bosses for you to challenge yourself against. So, here’s how to face off against these bosses and a few tips on how to beat them.</p>
<p><em>Note: This guide contains Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door post-game SPOILERS.</em></p>
<p>Have the spoiler-phobic left the room? Okay, without further ado…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd38.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Prince Mush</strong></h2>
<p>That’s right, the original champion of the Glitz Pit before being replaced by Rawk Hawk can now be taken on for the ultimate title of champion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd39.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How to Fight Prince Mush</strong></p>
<p>While Prince Mush may send you a message challenging you earlier in the game, you have to finish up the main story and roll credits in order to fight him. He’ll be hanging out in the hallway near the save block and locker rooms in the Glitz Pit. Talk to him and accept his challenge. Then go to one of the GBA-shaped terminals to fight him as an exhibition match.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd40.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Strategy Tips</strong></p>
<p>Despite his unintimidating appearance, Prince Mush is definitely a tough customer, rocking 96 HP, 6 Attack, and 6 Defense. The Prince has a couple stances -- one where he’s kind of hopping up and down, and one where’s shimmying back and forth – you can only damage when he’s doing the former, as he’ll always dodge when he’s in the latter stance. So, when he’s moving back and forth, use your time to heal and use attack-boosting items like Power Lift or the Charge ability. If you pull off a successful Superguard, he will be essentially stunned for a turn, giving you more opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>Once you knock off about half of Prince Mush’s HP, he’ll repeatedly go Super Saiyan and boost his attack power. Prince Mush will gain a new combo during this phase, where he flies at you from all directions doing heavy damage with each hit. This combo sucks, but if you can pull off a Superguard during one of the strikes, he will be stunned again. He also has a move where he splits into three – hit the “real” Mush to return him to normal. This second phase is tough, but if you stock up on lots of Life Shrooms and hit a few Superguards, you’ll come out on top.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd41.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Whacka</strong></h2>
<p>And the other secret boss is… Whacka. He’s tougher than he looks!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd42.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How to fight Whacka</strong></p>
<p>Whacka is down at the bottom of the Pit of 100 Trials, which is located to the west of the underground room containing the Thousand-Year Door. Slip through the gate on the east side of the Thousand-Year Door room, bounce up to the paper airplane platform, then glide to the platform on the east side of the room to access the door to the Pit of 100 Trials.</p>
<p>In order to fight Whacka, you’ll need to play through the entirety of the Pit of 100 Trials and defeat Bonetail. Once you’ve done that… do it all again! You can pay 300 coins to skip to floor 50, but otherwise, you’re going to have to repeat the pit. Once you reach floor 100, Bonetail will be replaced by Whacka. Talk to him to fight him.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd43.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Strategy Tips</strong></p>
<p>Whacka is pretty straightforward, but he’s tough, rocking 108 HP, 10 Attack, and 1 Defense. Every time you attack Whacka, he’ll drop a “Whacka Bump” – basically, a little bun – which he can eat to regain HP or throw at you as an attack. These Bumps come in yellow and red variants, with red being more powerful. Basically, use attacks that don’t inflict a lot of individual hits so Whacka won’t generate too many Bumps. Other than that, just work on Superguarding Whacka’s attacks and load up on Life Shrooms. This fight will be long due to Whacka’s high HP and healing ability, but stick to it, and you’ll come out on top.</p>
<p>And there you go – that’s how you take out two of the toughest customers in the game!</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

One day, a heavy tariff was imposed by the king who ruled a neighboring country, making overland trade impossible. In order to save her country from its predicament, Rota begins a new trade by sea in the port town of Portamare. Let’s greatly develop Portamare through trade using ships and aim for the revival of Rosecania!</p><p>There are three types of residents in the town of Portamare: farmers, merchants, and sailors. Each resident has their own skills, and in the case of merchants, they play an active role in business negotiation battles. Build various facilities around the city and produce export goods. The cute residents drawn with pixel art move around the map while muttering to themselves. Sometimes tourists visit our town!</p><p>Business negotiations with other countries can be conducted by Rota himself or by hired merchants. The biggest challenge is how cheap imports can be bought and how high exports can be sold.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Trade is carried out by sea using ships. There are different types of ships, and the larger they are, the more export goods they can carry. Also, when it becomes possible to trade with new countries, the types of facilities will increase, and people from other countries will appear as residents of Portamare.</p><p>There is also a ranking event held once a year to evaluate the degree of development of the city. Let’s do our best to further develop Portamare!</p></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rotas-nautical-chronicles-of-trade/may-23-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_884588"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"For instance, non player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal.</p><p>"This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally.</p></div><p>Video games have endured a particularly complicated relationship with AI since its re-emergence in the last couple of years, and the debate will likely only grow larger and more complex in the coming years and as companies like Sony look even further ahead.</p><p>Embark Studios, the developer of smash hit shooter The Finals, was criticized for using AI voiceovers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-criticised-by-actors-and-devs-for-using-ai-generated-voice-overs">by myriad actors and even other developers</a>, for example, but Embark told IGN that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-responds-to-the-finals-ai-criticism-making-games-without-actors-isnt-an-end-goal">"making games without actors isn't an end goal"</a> and claimed it used a mix of both recorded audio voices and audio generated via AI text to speech tools for its games.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actors-speak-out-on-nsfw-skyrim-mods-nexus-mods">Video game voice actors have also called out AI-generated explicit Skyrim mods</a>, and Assassin's Creed Syndicate voice actress <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-calls-ai-generated-mods-the-invisible-enemy-were-fighting-right-now">Victoria Atkin called AI-generated mods the “invisible enemy</a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-calls-ai-generated-mods-the-invisible-enemy-were-fighting-right-now"> we're fighting right now”</a> after discovering her voice was used by cloning software. Paul Eiding, the voice actor behind Colonel Campbell in the Metal Gear Solid series, also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-voice-actor-paul-eiding-speaks-out-on-fans-ai-using-his-voice-work-without-permission">condemned its use</a>.</p><p>The Witcher voice actor Doug Cockle also expressed caution and frustration at the growing presence of AI within the video game industry, calling it "inevitable" but "dangerous." Ironically, however, the biggest developer to use AI for voice acting so far is The Witcher studio CD Projekt Red, though this was only done <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-developer-cd-projekt-used-ai-to-replace-deceased-voice-actor-with-familys-permission">to replace a deceased voice actor after gaining permission from the family</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still.</blockquote><p>Both the Necrons and the Adeptus Mechanicus are fully playable over multiple campaigns, Kasedo said. You manage your territories’ garrisons and assemble forces for each mission, choosing from an expanded selection of fighters from each faction’s range. New environmental mechanics require players to maneuver their forces, taking cover behind terrain as the Mechanicus, or destroying it as the Necrons (the Necrons have no need for cover, after all).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The story is penned by Black Library author Ben Counter, with music and audio design by composer Guillaume David. Narrative events will see the player choosing the course of the war and its outcome, Kasedo added.</p><p>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2 is coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. No release window was mentioned.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

If you're a fan of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun's retro-inspired first-person shooting action - and you might well be given how positively it was received - you've got a fresh chunk of the stuff to look forward to in a few short weeks now that developer Auroch Digital and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced an expansion is coming on 18th June.
</p>
<p>
Forges of Corruption, as Boltgun's first expansion is officially known, includes a brand-new campaign spanning five new environments. Three of those have been revealed so far - the Graia Battlefields, Manufactorum, and the heretic-infested Daemonic Forge - and there's also promise of new enemies inhabiting these dangerous locales.
</p>
<p>
Ultramarines stepping forth into Forges of Corruption can expect to encounter the vicious Black Havok Legion, the Helbrute, and the Terminator with its Lighting Claw. Luckily, there's a bit of (literal) extra bang for your expansion bucks in the form of two new weapons: the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher.

<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun's Forges of Corruption expansion launches for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on 18th June. It arrives alongside a new Forges of Corruption Edition - combining the base game and DLC for a "reduced" price - as well as a free update for all players.
</p>
<p>
This introduces a new Horde mode, featuring four difficulty levels and its own achievements, plus a navigation guide, bug fixes and quality of life improvements. Oh and if you haven't yet played Boltgun, it's currently on sale across all platforms, with discounts ranging from 25-40 percent.
</p>
<p>
And is it worth it? Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane was largely positive about the whole thing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-a-signature-weapon-so-good-it-breaks-the-game">in his three star review</a>. "If you want to make a big ol' mess with one excellent gun and several other decent ones," he wrote, "Boltgun satisfies this desire. A few design tweaks and a little more attention to detail would elevate it from a good shooter into a great one, but as a throwback starter course to the hotly anticipated main that is Space Marine 2, Boltgun does an acceptable job of stimulating the tastebuds."

                <p>EA has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-4-review/1900-6415867/" data-ref-id="1900-6415867">The Sims 4</a> now has a dedicated team that will primarily focus on addressing ongoing bugs.</p><p>The publisher shared the news today in a social media post, where it explained how it plans to combat ongoing technical issues for its popular free-to-play game that have continued to interrupt gameplay over time.</p><p>After recognising players' frustration, EA confirmed that it has officially assembled a team "to invest in the core game experience" which includes "tackling reported concerns."</p><p>"This newly formed and focused team means we'll be able to increase both the number of fixes and the frequency with which we ship these batched updates," the statement reads. The first of these patches is expected to release later this month.</p><p>EA has also offered up a Laundry List of changes that will arrive with the May patch, which will cover the base game and it's additional DLC expansions. You can take a look at these upcoming fixes on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_qol-ll-ig&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=80373&amp;ts=1716498498626" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Sims 4 Newsroom</a>.</p><p>"Our goal is to fix more reported concerns, both big and small, over the next six months and beyond to check off more boxes on our Laundry List," the blog reads. "This is our first release, with others following roughly every two months."</p><p>In addition, EA explained that it will continue to make "core improvements to the performance of The Sims 4" with the next patch set to include optimizations across all platforms so the game uses less memory.</p><p>"As a result, you may experience fewer crashes, a better frame rate, and/or a more responsive simulation," it said.</p>

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Embark on a thrilling<em>&nbsp;</em>treasure hunt in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/roblox-the-classic-event-start-and-end-dates-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblox The Classic</em>&nbsp;event</a>, where you can earn an exclusive Token. The challenge lies in locating all books, a task that can be daunting due to the vastness of the map. So, let’s dive into all book locations in the&nbsp;<em>Roblox The Classic&nbsp;</em>Buried Treasure quest.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-all-books-in-roblox-the-classic-buried-treasure-quest" data-injectable="false">Where to find all books in Roblox The Classic Buried Treasure quest</h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Before we delve into the specifics, let’s give you a quick overview of what to expect. The Buried Treasure book and treasure locations can only be found in the following areas of the <em>Roblox The Classic </em>hub (we’ll break down each one afterward):</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"> <li>Main hub near the fountain</li> <li>Your House</li> <li>Castle</li> <li>Food area</li> <li><em>Roblox </em>HQ building</li> <li>Volcano area</li> <li><em>Roblox The Hunt </em>portal</li> <li>Sphere structure</li> <li>Race car destination</li> <li>The ship (treasure location)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Classic</em>&nbsp;event doesn’t have a map for an exact location. So, here’s where you can&nbsp;find each one more efficiently:</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-1-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 1 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">When loading into&nbsp;<em>Roblox The Classic</em>, go straight to the Rubber Ducky Fountain area to claim your first book. Hold down the ‘E’ key to begin the Buried Treasure quest.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-2-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 2 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Another book will be located on the right side of the map. It’ll be in the same area as the ‘Your House’ location, where you can change into Classic clothing. On the left side of the home, you’ll spot the second book near the trampoline and teapots.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-3-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 3 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">After discovering the second book, cross the purple structure to the left. You’ll see a house with a red and white sunshade. Look by the tables to claim the third book.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-4-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 4 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">Return to the Your House location and jump on the reflecting walkway to the right. Make your way to the castle and collect the fourth Buried Treasure book by going up the ladders.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-5-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 5 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">The fifth book will be at the top of the&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>HQ tower. One of the walkaways is near the purchasing area for the Treasure Finder and Timeless Valkyrie skins. Once you’ve reached the building, use the ladders and stairs to get up high.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-6-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 6 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Another book will be to the left of the&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>HQ tower, showcasing a volcano domain. Go toward the right side of the volcano, where there will be a walkway to the sixth book location in&nbsp;<em>Roblox The Classic</em>. Although it will look like the pathway&nbsp;is broken, you can still get across it if you head straight forward on the yellow route.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-7-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 7 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

It’ll be right before&nbsp;<em>The Hunt</em>&nbsp;portal, so it should be easy to notice.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-8-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 8 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">The following book location will take you above the skies, presenting a floating guitar and orb. On the ground level, use the yellow jumping platform to go on top of the sphere.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">You’ll find a drop-down point at the back of the moon-like structure (to the right of the rocket). Enter it to discover a green-colored house. Then, go inside it and use the ladders to claim the book on the upper level.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-buried-treasure-stage-9-location" data-injectable="false">Buried Treasure Stage 9 location</h3> <figure data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">The last book location takes you down below&nbsp;<em>The Classic</em>&nbsp;map. You can get here by using the drop-down point by the pathway to the Your House destination.&nbsp;Travel to the car area to claim the book on the cliff’s edge.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-roblox-the-classic-final-buried-treasure-location" data-injectable="false">Roblox The Classic final Buried Treasure location</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Instead of finding a book, the last task requires you to find the hidden treasure underneath an ‘X.’ It will be next to a ship (buried in the sand.) Use the platforms to reach this area, but keep in mind that they can sometimes disappear.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="false">Upon&nbsp;reaching&nbsp;the X for the Buried Treasure Stage 10, you’ll be rewarded with a valuable&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>Token. Collect more of these Tokens by completing other quests and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-roblox-the-classic-games-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>. These Tokens can be exchanged via the Event Tracker, providing gifts like the Empyrean Reign of Awesomeness and Kelos Erebus.</p>

            <p>
With another week of 2024 now crossed off the calendar, Epic has delved deep into its big bag of treats to reveal the Epic Games Store's latest freebie - and this time it's Farming Simulator 22.
</p>
<p>
This not-quite-latest instalment in developer Giants Software's long-running agricultural sim (and I'm about to paraphrase the official blurb here seeing as I'm not much of an expert on this one) gives wannabe farmers the tools to establish their own vineyard or olive orchard in the south of France; to grow wheat, corn, potatoes, and cotton in the US Midwest, or even establish an animal farm in alpine climes. Presumably you can grow a potato in France too if you want to mix things up, but don't hold me to that.
</p>
<p>
Farming Simulator 22 squeezes in 400 machines and tools from over 100 real agricultural brands, alongside a "multitude of new gameplay features" - including a new character creator, an expanded build mode, and new ground working options including mulching and stone picking. Best of all, Farming Simulator 22 features cross-platform multiplayer support so you can build your agricultural empire with friends.
</p>

<p>
If, after all that, you're ready to straddle a tractor and trundle off into the great unknown, Farming Simulator 22 can be <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/farming-simulator-22">permanently added to your Epic Games Store library</a> right now - and the offers remains available until next Thursday, 30th May.
</p>
<p>
As for what comes after, that's currently under wraps. Expect next week's "mystery game" (as Epic is referring to it at present) to be revealed just as soon as Farming Simulator 22 steps aside.

Orders are currently expected to ship by October 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The chair uses Secrelab's NEO leatherette upholstery with the iconic blue and gold color scheme of the Ultramarines space marine chapter and features embossed decals like the Ultima emblem on the back of the chair and eagle icon on the front. There are also panel lines and thick, rivet-like stitching that resemble Space Marine armor. Like other Titan Evo chairs, the Warhammer 40K edition is padded with cold-cure foam.</p><p dir="ltr">To really <em>seal </em>the chair's authentic Warhammer 40K look, there is an Imperium purity seal on the headrest. In the 40K lore, these seals are affixed to the armor of space marines and other members of the Imperium forces who have proven their "purity of faith in the Emperor" through victory in battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306737-evowh40k.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4306737" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306737-evowh40k.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4306737"></a><figcaption>Secretlab Titan Evo - Warhammer 40K Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306737-evowh40k.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306738-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_backrest.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306739-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_back.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306740-%5Bsubimage2_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306741-%5Bsubimage1_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306742-%5Bmainimage_painting%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4306738,1300-4306739,1300-4306740,1300-4306741,1300-4306742" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306738-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_backrest.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306739-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_back.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306740-%5Bsubimage2_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306741-%5Bsubimage1_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4306742-%5Bmainimage_painting%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306738-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_backrest.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306739-%5Bsubimage%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000_back.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306740-%5Bsubimage2_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306741-%5Bsubimage1_gaming%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4306742-%5Bmainimage_painting%5Dsecretlabxwarhammer40%2C000.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the aesthetic differences, the Warhammer 40K edition Titan Evo sports all the same features as the standard Titan Evo line, including the four-directional armrests and dynamic four-way lumbar support built directly into the back.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warhammer 40K edition Titan Evo gaming chair is available now for $624 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsecretlab.co%2Fpages%2Fwarhammer40000&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsecretlab-announces-a-warhammer-40k-space-marine-editon-titan-evo-gaming-chair%2F1100-6523650%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Secretlab's online store</a>.
