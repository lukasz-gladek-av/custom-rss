            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">open beta</a> is over, and encouraging whispers of its oo-rahhable player count – peaking at over 500,000 on PC alone, so sayeth <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> – have been tempered with widespread <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">reports of invading cheaters</a>. That’s despite BF6’s new and unusual requirement to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">enable Secure Boot</a>, a BIOS-level security feature in Windows, ostensibly to prevent such do-badding.</p>
<p>In response, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">forum post</a> attributed to EA’s anti-cheat team has played up successes in tracking and catching the beta’s cheaters, whose crimes allegedly range from classic wallhacks, speed hacks, and aimbots to cheats that reduce recoil or display enemy health and weapon info. However, it also concedes that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet" – and in doing so, highlights the immense, perhaps impossible task that developers have of keeping cheater users out of their games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don’t mean to suggest that cheat makers are a breed of impressive technogeniuses. They trade in malevolence for profit, making them almost as big a bunch of loser babies as their customers. But they are persistent, and prideful, so attempts by publishers and developers to big up their latest anti-cheat as being particularly difficult to crack is often seen as a challenge as much as a deterrent. Vanguard, the AC system Riot Games use for their tactical FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>, holds a kind of grudgingly respected reputation among players for its relative efficacy, yet cheaters still show up now and then to spoil its shootouts.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's true that EA, or BF6 developers DICE, never claimed that requiring Secure Boot would keep hackers out for good. The feature is also just one component of the game’s wider AC protection, named Javelin, which that forum post boasts of having stopped 330,000 cheating and tampering attempts like they were .22 rounds pinging off a tank’s backside. That’s about three successful interventions for every five players, which suggests two things: one, Battlefield 6 faces an absolutely enormous number of malicious actors, and two, if you played the open beta at the weekend, there’s a very good chance that at least one of your games was saved from a cheating attempt.</p>
<p>Some of those numbers were undoubtedly passed around BF6 headquarters as evidence of Javelin’s great success. Except it was also beaten, in a matter of hours, and by a fairly wide variety of different cheats. And anti-cheat systems are a lot like Premier League goalkeepers: you can keep out attempt after attempt, but let just one through and people will think you're rubbish.</p>
<p>I’d argue, then, that the biggest challenge facing multiplayer developers isn’t the pursuit of creating a truly hacker-free game. That, based on current evidence, looks close to impossible. Instead, it’s expectation management: what’s a publicly acceptable proportion of hackers to breach the system, and maybe more importantly, how much can you ask of rule-abiding players before they start getting genuinely pissed off by your AC requirements? What’s a palatable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio">Blackstone’s ratio</a> of inconvenienced innocents versus catchable perps?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So far, there haven’t been any recorded instances of EA – or Riot, whose Vanguard system also goes rooting around in the deepest depths of your PC – using kernel-access anti-cheat for anything untoward. But having to manually enable Secure Boot, especially if you’re not a frequent BIOS spelunker, is enough of a faff that for someone, somewhere, it’s going to chip away at goodwill. There have been recorded instances of user-end problems after the fact, too. The most ironic of which being that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat can actually <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-faces-issues-with-val">clash with Valorant’s</a>, like two hench bouncers trying to fit through the same doorframe. Last year, a more extreme case of 'acceptable loss' calculations saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">Steam Deck players booted permanently out of Apex Legends</a>, on the grounds that the handheld's Linux-based OS was making it too hard to keep cheaters away.</p>
<p>For now, developers seem to be weighing security more heavily than convenience. Respawn would later, with barely concealed pride, <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1865148176275247312">wheel out an "infection rate" graph</a> as evidence that dropping Linux support was a worthy sacrifice. And as for Battlefield 6... well, their beta just got half a million concurrents. For all the grumbling about Secure Boot, it sure does look like players are happy to go along with it.</p>
<p>Provided, anyway, that it’s in service of an anti-cheat system that broadly works – or at least one that enough people <em>perceive</em> to work. Secure Boot might not be a particularly strong turn-off, but the one thing that gets players quitting faster than being lasered by some prick with X-ray vision is the belief, justified or otherwise, that he or his ilk will show up in the next game too. Battlefield 6 can’t stop every single cheater. But it’ll need to keep quiet the ones that do.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>On August 8, Grass Wonder, a real-world racehorse which gacha game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/umamusume-pretty-derby-horse-girl-gacha-game-ludwig-1851785849"><i><span>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</span></i></a> <span>based one of its anime horse girls on, died at the age of 30. According to </span><a href="https://www.bigredfarm.jp/post/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC-%E6%AD%BB%E5%8E%BB"><span>the official obituary</span></a><span>, the horse (who is male in real life) passed due to multiple organ failure. The official </span><i><span>Umamusume</span></i><span> social media accounts </span><a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804"><span>paid tribute to Grass Wonder</span></a><span> upon news of his death, and fans decided to pay tribute to the horse through </span><a href="https://x.com/Neshaa_3450/status/1954207604743254457"><span>a piece of pixel art</span></a><span> on </span><a href="https://wplace.live/"><span>Wplace</span></a><span>, a world map that users can paint and collaborate on. However, things nearly went awry when fans realized the art they were attempting to recreate was AI-generated, until the community rallied to change things up and pay a more honest tribute to Grass Wonder.</span></p> <p><span>If you’ve never heard of Wplace, it’s an interactive world map that lets you paint over any location, and people use it to create some pretty incredible digital art. It’s a living canvas that anyone can draw on, and that includes making a tribute to race horses who are no longer with us. A group of Umamusume fans started creating a piece on the map around Dolores, Quezon in the Philippines, where many of the organizing fans are based. The artwork depicts Grass Wonder walking through a field with a bouquet of sunflowers in hand. The text “Farewell, Grass Wonder” is shown above her in a blue sky. While it’s a lovely gesture, the group project got a bit more complicated when it was discovered that the original reference art </span><a href="https://x.com/scalizo_art/status/1954353052322058262"><span>was AI-generated</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The project began on a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kabayongbabaepilipinas"><span>Philippine</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kabayongbabaepilipinas"><span>Facebook fan page</span></a><span>, and once people realized the original artwork was AI slop, the group’s admin </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kabayongbabaepilipinas/posts/1427845951603157/"><span>put out an apology statement</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Message of the admin from the group of where the collaboration idea started! </p> <p>Truly, I apologize on behalf of the group alongside the admins. </p> <p>This wasn't meant to trick people, we genuinely wanted a community that works together. </p> <p>Again,I apologize.

Grass Wonder is one of 114 playable horse girls in</span><i><span> Umamusume</span></i><span>, each of which you train to race in a run-based, almost rogue-like fashion. The game originally launched in Japan in 2021 before rolling out in other Asian territories over the following years. </span><i><span>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</span></i><span> finally launched worldwide back in June, and has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/umamusume-pretty-derby-horse-girl-stable-guidelines-1851786102"><span>become a viral sensation</span></a><span> after big streamers like Ludwig and Northern Lion played it on their channels.</span></p>

            <p>A collaboration between The Pokémon Company and McDonald's has ended early due to scalping and food waste.</p>
<p>An exclusive Pikachu trading card was available as part of a Happy Meal promotion, from 9th August until 11th August. However, this ended after less than a day of availability "due to sales exceeding expectations", according to a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">statement from McDonald's</a>. "We sincerely apologise for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who have been looking forward to it due to the early end of distribution."</p>
<p>However, as reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/08/amid-chaos-mcdonalds-japan-sells-out-of-pokemon-tcg-promo-cards-in-less-than-a-day">Poké Beach</a>, the promotion resulted in chaos - long queues, card scalping, and food waste. Images show uneaten food left on the streets to rot as customers seek only the special card.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios, the team behind popular free-to-play FPS The Finals, was heavily showcasing its upcoming third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, with a large-scale public playtest this past April, followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/">major release date trailer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen anything more of the game, and Embark Studios has just confirmed that we'll continue to see nothing until we're much closer to its October 30th launch date. In a statement published to the game's official X account, Embark Studios has confirmed the team is in a heads-down state leading up to launch.</p>



<p>There won't be another public playtest for the game before launch, and Embark won't be featuring the game at Gamescom 2025, which is a little more than a week away at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>Our focus is now on polishing and expanding the experience, and putting all the learnings from TT2 into action ahead of release</em>," the statement reads. "<em>Just so you know, we're not planning additional public tests before launch. We've learned from our last announcement that it's crucial to keep expectations in check, so we also want to be clear that we won't be at Gamescom. But don't worry, our launch campaign will kick off before you know it!"</em></p>



<p>"<em>We'll have many more updates for you in the lead-up to launch. Thank you for all the support and encouragement you've been sending our way! It means the world</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to check out ARC Raiders earlier this year</a>, and in his preview noted it as a "<em>promising</em>" title, though of course there's only so much that can be gleamed from public playtests ahead of launch. That said, Alessio marked that "<em>Embark seems to have mixed in enough familiar and new elements to create an exciting recipe.</em>"</p>

<p>The<i> Puyo Puyo Tetris</i> series combines two classic puzzle franchises into a single fun and vibrant experience, and it tends to be a pretty damn good time. With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out in the wild, fans of the series can get their hands on <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>, an enhanced version of 2020’s <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</i>. You can tell it’s enhanced because of the “S”, which is the universal way to know something is extra cool, I think.</p> <p>Anyway, this new version of the game brings a variety of upgrades and new features, such as the new 2v2 Doubles Mode, a bunch of additional characters, and even mouse controls. But if you’re a diehard fan, you’ll probably be checking out the Adventure Mode, which sends you off on a journey across an overworld map to compete against foes for some puzzle mayhem. How long will you spend seeing things through? How does its mouse mode work? And what should you consider before grabbing a physical version? Let’s take a look.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%98s-adventure-mode"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>‘s Adventure Mode?<span></span></h2> <p>So, let’s get something out of the way: <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is a puzzle game with endless replayability, so how many hours of fun you get out of it will be based on how much you enjoy <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>. However, the Adventure Mode tells a story with missions to tackle, speaking more to folks who like a campaign to tackle. And that campaign is finite, naturally.</p>

 <p><b>Simply reaching the end of </b><b><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i></b><b>‘s Adventure Mode can take 10-15 hours</b>, depending on your skill level. But you can stretch things out much further by trying to tackle every optional mission and side story the game has to offer. Additionally, completionists will want to aim to get a full four-star rating on every mission to show they know their shit. Not me, though, because I’m equally dreadful at <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Speaking of being bad at puzzle games, you can mess with the difficulty to help set you up for success if you’re not making any headway in the campaign. I don’t feel much shame admitting that I’m just not very fast or good at stacking all this colorful stuff, and neither should you.</p> <h2><span id="how-well-does-mouse-mode-work-on-puyo-puyo-tertris-2s"></span>How well does mouse mode work on <i>Puyo Puyo Tertris 2S</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Not only does the <i>2S</i> version of this game toss in the 2v2 Doubles Mode, it also allows you to use the Switch’s “mouse mode” to move your blocks around. In this mode you’ll use your shoulder button to rotate the block, while pulling down with the mouse will accelerate how fast the block falls. While this adds a level of physicality you might otherwise not expect in <i>Tetris</i>, it can be a challenge to pull the mouse down in a perfectly straight line, so don’t be surprised if the blocks land a little to the left or right when using this mode.</p>

 <h2><span id="puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%99-physical-version-comes-on-a-gamekey-card"></span><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>’ physical version comes on a Game-Key Card<span></span></h2> <p>If you were hoping to grab a physical copy of this game, you should know that you’ll still need to download the full game with an internet connection. The card that ships in the case is only a key for a license to download the game and doesn’t have the full data available for you to play.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Switch 2 Owners Are Leaping On A Survey To Express Fury Over Game Key Cards</a></p> <p>On the flip side, you can still share or resell this Game-Key card, which you can’t do with a “digital” version. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Game-Key cards are an ongoing frustration</a> for Switch 2 fans, and <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S </i>is no exception.</p> <hr> <p><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>He’s the leader of the bunch, you know him well, but where is Donkey Kong in the roster of <i>Mario Kart World</i>? When you load up the game and try to find the newly-redesigned DK, you may be disappointed to not be able to find him. Luckily, you can find him without too much trouble! Here’s what you need to know to unlock Donkey Kong in <i>Mario Kart World</i>, which tracks he’s best on, and what karts you should use when playing as him.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-donkey-kong-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World<span></span></h2> <p>To unlock Donkey Kong, you only need to complete the Mushroom Cup in the Grand Prix mode. It might seem like a massive oversight to not have Donkey Kong unlock for completing the Banana Cup, but considering the Mushroom Cup culminates in the track DK Spaceport, it’s a good place to find him.</p> <p>Placement is irrelevant here; you only need to complete the grand prix to qualify. Whether you end up in first place or 24th, you’ll be able to add DK to your playable roster. You might want to try playing the cup again if you ended up in 24th, though.</p>

 <h2><span id="which-karts-are-best-for-donkey-kong"></span>Which karts are best for Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>There are at least four karts that will serve Donkey Kong well against other racers. Chagrin’ Truck is easily one of the fastest, but the Baby Blooper sacrifices top speed for some increased handling you may find useful. Following these two karts, the Reel Racer and Stellar Sled offer a nice combination of speed and handling.</p> <h2><span id="donkey-kong-unlockable-costumes"></span>Donkey Kong Unlockable Costumes<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616899"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616899">© Screenshot: Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unfortunately, as if making him unlockable wasn’t enough, the DK disrespect continues with his unlockable costumes. He has one costume for players to find out in the open world. This puts him barely above minor drivers like Cow and Snowman, and below the main cast of characters. I don’t know how it happened that costumes for King Boo somehow rank above the ape that started it all, but here we are.</p> <p>Donkey Kong’s only unlockable costume is All-Terrain. You can find it by eating quite a few different foods from around the map; try out a variety and you’re bound to find it before long. It’s a great looking costume. Just try to block out any memories it surfaces of 2022’s disappointing Mario Strikers: Battle League.</p> <h2><span id="what-tracks-favor-donkey-kong"></span>What tracks favor Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>For the most part, other heavy-class characters like Bowser might be the pick to hit the best times. But tracks like Crown City, Desert Hills, Wario Shipyard, Koopa Troopa Beach, Dandelion Depths, Choco Mountain all typically favor the heavy class, so Donkey Kong should perform well here.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 in the United States promises to remain stable for the immediate future, as Sony has already taken measures to limit the impact of tariffs.</p>



<p>During the Q1 2026 Earnings Call a couple of days ago, as transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810238-sony-group-corporation-sony-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed the company is diversifying their supply chain, and production has already been transfered outside China for units to be sold in the United States to limit the impact of the tariffs. Regarding peripherals, the shift is still ongoing and will be completed by the end of the first half of the fiscal year. Regarding the company's pricing strategy for consoles, the Sony CFO couldn't make a definitive statement, as factors like annual profit, lifetime value, sell-in volume and expected content sales will be considered, as well as how consumers react to prices. As such, the strategy remains flexible.</p>



<p>The current worldwide economic situation is making it challenging for console manufacturers to keep prices down. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">April</a>, the price of the PlayStation 5 was increased in Europe, the UK, and Australia, and although it hasn't in the United States, there's no certainty it will at some point, judging from the statement above. Nintendo, however, did not manage to keep the price of its previous generation system, as the Japanese company has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">increased</a> the price of all of the original Nintendo Switch models in the US, with price increases ranging from $30 to $50.</p>



<p>Economic uncertainty is definitely influencing how the next console generation will shape up. According to leaks, Sony is designing the PlayStation 6 to deliver a 4K, 120 FPS experience while keeping costs down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">a proposition that would be enticing at any price below $900</a>, according to a former AMD employee.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that their dating sim<i>&nbsp;Date Everything!&nbsp;</i>has managed to hit a major sales milestone in the weeks since its release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer" rel="nofollow">finally released back in June</a>, has sold 500,000 copies across all the platforms on which it's currently available. The game isn't playable as part of any major subscription services, either, so this figure does refer exclusively to sales and not just "players".</p>

<p>As part of celebrations for reaching this sales milestone, Team17 and Sassy Chap Games are giving away a washing machine (yes, you read that right), because, well, as the studios say, "people need washing machines [and] some people clearly like dating washing machines". Can't argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-sales-500k-himbos.jpg?itok=cv7b-u8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-sales-500k-himbos.jpg?itok=kaoihnIB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone, and there's a rather quirky giveaway going on to celebrate.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to enter this giveaway (which, I'll remind you, will result in you receiving a real washing machine if you win), all you need to do is send a custom description or drawing of your custom&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>character to Team17 and Sassy Chap. You can read more about how to enter <a href="https://www.team17.com/competition/date-everything-washing-machine-competition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a dating sim that allows you to date...okay, not quite everything, but certainly a lot of things you can't date anywhere else. That includes your washing machine, but also a candelabra, a piano, and even the concept of existential dread.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">announced in July last year</a>, it was due for release in 2024, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day this year</a>, which would have been the best possible release date for it. Unfortunately, it was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">pushed back again</a>, eventually finding its permanent launch day in June.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/date-everything-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and therefore also Nintendo Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

He joined in 2018.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Let’s be honest, Gigabyte. Your marketing for the <strong>Aero X16</strong> is giving Razer Blade, from the colors and font of the spec slides to the thin design of the space gray laptop itself. While we haven’t tested out this model to see how it stacks up to Razer’s gaming machine, its price is certainly a <em>lot </em>more attractive. At <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-aero-x16-copilot-pc-16-25601600-wqxga-amd-ryzen-al-7-350-1tb-ssd-32gb-ddr5-ram-geforce-rtx-5070-space-gray%2F6632266.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, you can get a capable midrange model with AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 graphics chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,299.99 (normally $1,649.99).</p><p>Whether you’re in need of a laptop built mainly for gaming, creative work, or work tasks, there’s a lot to like with this Aero X16 configuration. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio QHD screen, which affords a bit more vertical space than your average laptop screen (letting you read more lines at once without scrolling, for example). It has a lot of other specs that I’m happy to see in a laptop that costs less than $1,500, like a 165Hz high refresh rate screen, a capable RTX 5070 GPU, plus the ability to easily add more RAM (two slots, with support for up to 64GB DDR5 5,600MHz) and storage (two PCIe 4.0 slots) after purchase.</p><p>Comparing this Gigabyte model to its closest Razer Blade 16 equivalent isn’t exactly apples to apples, of course — there’s some features you just won’t see in the Aero X16. The<a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05286EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored"> RTX 5070-equipped Blade 16 </a>is $2,399.99, and likewise comes with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, but you’ll also get a QHD OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate by default, not to mention a more polished design.</p><div><p id="other-deals-to-get-your-monday-going"><h2>Other deals to get your Monday going</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>-inspired Xbox wireless controller</strong> that’s covered in Doom Slayer design flair is $54 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-DOOM-The-Dark-Ages-Limited-Edition%2F15128257819" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, down from its original $79.99 price. If you’ve always wanted a controller with a blood splatter painted on, and its ABXY labels replaced with in-game glyphs, this is the gamepad for you. Looking past the unique design, it’s a standard Xbox wireless controller, with replaceable AA batteries, reliable connectivity, and Bluetooth support for seamless pairing with PCs, phones, tablets, and more.</span></li><li><span>A bunch of PS5 disc games are discounted at Best Buy for seemingly no apparent reason — not that a reason is ever required for good discounts.

              <p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-show-ubisoft-plot-date-1851786489">isn’t the only hit Ubisoft blockbuster</a> getting a TV series spin-off. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-6-the-kotaku-review-1847830444"><em>Far Cry</em></a> will be adapted as well, according to a recent leak on the publisher’s website. But the psychological horror series for FX will be helmed by an unlikely individual: Rob Mac of <a href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540"><em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></a> fame.</p> <p>A news post that seemingly went up early <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">on Ubisoft’s news site over the weekend</a> before being quickly deleted indicated (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">according to Reddit</a>) that a <em>Far Cry</em> show will be coming from <em>It’s Always Sunny</em>‘s home network, FX, with Mac joined by <em>Fargo</em> TV creator Noah Hawley, who also recently launched <em>Alien: Earth</em>. Hawley will be showrunner, while Mac reportedly stars in the “anthology” style<em> Far Cry</em> show.</p> <p>The FX house style is probably a good fit for the franchise, though it remains to be seen what a TV version of sneaking through outposts and blowing them up with gas tanks and RPG launchers ends up looking like. Mac isn’t a completely left-field pick either. Ubisoft has been working with him up through the cancellation of <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, the workplace comedy about game development created with Megan Ganz and Charlie Day.</p> <p>Ubisoft has a new <em>Far Cr</em>y sequel currently in the works, and with previous entries being best-sellers, the open-world FPS franchise is an obvious candidate for the current video game-to-TV pipeline gold rush. And unlike <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, each <em>Far Cry</em> game features completely different characters and scenarios, giving the show’s writers and producers lots of creative flexibility with how to present the loose franchise’s pillars of carving up animals for inventory upgrades and cult-leader villains.</p>

<p>The principal game designer at DICE is asking players to share video examples of unexpectedly fast time-to-death (TTD) during the Battlefield 6 open beta. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s first open beta was a resounding success, becoming the franchise’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta</a> yet and also beating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty’s concurrent record</a> on Steam. However, players encountered several bugs during the weekend, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed. The developers have already begun investigating BF6’s unexpectedly fast TTD bug. </p>







<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta is now over, and the developers have started addressing the bugs players encountered over the weekend. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/as-the-dust-settles-on-battlefield-6s-first-beta-weekend-devs-confirm-theyre-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-kill-times-in-the-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan posted on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954811982399381685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, informing players that the developers are already in the office reviewing BF6’s open beta feedback. Soon after, Le Bihan posts <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">again</a>, asking players to share video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD” they might have experienced during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta – send my way 🙂</p>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many players shared video examples, and others shared their experiences in reply. One player <a href="https://x.com/Mokonoise/status/1954848559708221684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> videos of two such instances: one where they were fighting under cover and were shot down instantly, and another where they took delayed damage after downing an enemy. For those unaware, TTD or time-to-death refers to the duration it takes for the player to die after taking damage. </p>

We take nothing for granted and we don't claim success until it occurs. So while I couldn't be more optimistic than I am, all of us have to do the work. We have to deliver something great to consumers and then the consumers are going to tell us just how great it is," he said.</p><p>GTA is one of the biggest, most commercially successful gaming franchises and the pent-up demand for GTA 6 is surely going to make it an enormous success when it releases. One firm is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million sales and billions in revenue in the first year alone</a>. For its part, Take-Two has not shared any sales or revenue projections for GTA 6, but it's expected to be a juggernaut.</p><p>While Zelnick wouldn't give any specific sales projections, he did say, "I do think it's fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment."</p><p>GTA 5 was released in 2013 and has sold more than 215 million copies across all platforms, making it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">one of the best-selling video games in history.</a> Given the game continues to sell, one analyst believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">one of the biggest "threats" to GTA 6 is actually GTA 5</a> and convincing people to leave that game for GTA 6.</p><p>There is also the question of what will happen with GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out. Rockstar has yet to share any information at all about GTA 6's expected online element, but these details should become clear in due time. GTA 6 launches May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a PC launch expected later. </p><p>Beyond GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">bringing Red Dead Redemption II to Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">launching a GTA 4 remaster.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Activision Blizzard president Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that he thinks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will "boot stomp" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Call of Duty</a> this year, and that this will push the CoD series to stop being "lazy".</p>
<p>The full post reads: "Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it." He elaborated on his thoughts in a response to another X user, writing:</p>
<p>"CoD has gone downhill for years since then. It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it."</p>

<p>Ybarra even touched on the recent spree of layoffs at Microsoft, the company that owns Activision Blizzard and as such the developers behind the Call of Duty series. Ybarra stated: "CoD will get better because BF will be great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps."</p>
<p>Since his departure from Activision Blizzard ahead of the Microsoft acquisition, Ybarra has since become CEO of Prizepicks. This sports betting company is notable through a gaming lens as an early adopter of esports betting, which it started embracing back in 2019.</p>
<p>It certainly seems like Ybarra's chips are on Battlefield this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty is still no slouch in terms of sales</a>, though positive sentiment has certainly taken a dip in recent years with complaints piling up (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">such as a distaste for certain cosmetics</a>).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has been steadily boosting its anime business and it's now been likened to the PlayStation's PS1 era.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/3609be19cc49117b054e2818fd30808944dcc10e?page=1">Toyo Keizai</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sonys-anime-business-is-in-its-early-playstation-stage-executive-says/">Automaton</a>), Sony CSO Toshimoto Mitomo (in charge of global IP development) said the company's anime business is "in a phase roughly equivalent to the period between the launch of the PS1 and PS2".</p>
<p>Back in August 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">Sony completed a $1.175bn acquisition of anime-streaming service Crunchyroll</a>. Then at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony increased its shares in FromSoftware owner Kadokawa</a>, with the intention to co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime, and adapt franchises into live-action film and TV dramas. As such, anime was core to the business decision - not, as fans may have hoped, to secure Bloodborne 2.</p>

<p>Even more recently, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-increasing-shares-in-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-sony-now-owns-25-of-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco">Sony acquired 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco</a>, once again in a bid to boost its anime business. "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated," the companies wrote in a joint statement.</p>
<p>While the PS1 was Sony's first home console, it proved immensely successful. With over 102m units sold, it's the sixth best-selling games console of all time. It was followed by the PS2, which saw Sony dominate the games industry with the best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Mitomo's comments seem to suggest that Sony's anime business is poised for similarly explosive growth, following its recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>Indeed, as just one example, Sony is breaking records in Japan with its release of Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, which had the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/after-the-best-opening-weekend-ever-in-japan-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-might-break-mugen-trains-usd500-million-box-office-anime-record/">biggest opening weekend ever in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly contrasts to the company's live-service strategy, which has seen a string of flops and cancellations. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-concord-and-a-string-of-delays-and-cancellations-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao recently admitted</a> the strategy is "not entirely going smoothly".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-anime-business-in-early-playstation-stage-says-company-executive]]></content:encoded>

<p>The horn section</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Developer Underwater Fire and publisher First Break Labs have just launched a new story trailer for their upcoming puzzle adventure game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/particle_hearts">Particle Hearts</a>, and, simply put, it looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>This one will see you playing as The Drifter, a mysterious horned figure made entirely of particles, who sets out on a journey through a savage land... also made entirely of particles. There are a lot of particles, but it's an interesting visual style which, should it run well on Switch, promises to be pretty nice on the eyes.</p>
<p>We don't know who The Drifter is, or what it is capable of, but you'll be relying on its particle-manipulation abilities to solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and befriend creatures, all while trying to work out what the heck's going on — who are you? Why do you have horns? Why's everything so... particle-y?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the Particle Hearts <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074740/Particle_Hearts/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gain multiple abilities that allow you to manipulate the particles around you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use your abilities to solve puzzles, evade enemies, and gain access to hidden areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freely explore open environments any way you’d like.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Experience a story where the line between friend and foe is often blurred. Meet various creatures that help you unravel your purpose in this land.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It all looks really rather interesting, and we're certainly intrigued to see where some of these mysteries go. Fortunately, we don't have too long to wait, as Particle Hearts will be making its way to Switch on <strong>25th August</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New PUBG Anti-Cheat System Coming in Next Update]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-coming-in-next-update.1267140/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that a new anti-cheat system will be making its way to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the popular battle royale game's next major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>&nbsp;on the official&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, Krafton says the new system is designed to "directly detect abnormal behavior at the deepest layer of the operating system". The game already had kernel-level anti-cheat measures in place, but the new tool will offer "even more precise and effective protection", the studio says.</p>

<p>Essentially, it works as you'd expect kernel-level anti-cheat to work; once you boot up the game, the tool scans for abnormal code, and if it detects any illegal software being used, it'll boot the player using it from the game and ban them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=aVN89Dnb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=g8TWlfkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New anti-cheat tools are coming to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the game's next update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, the new anti-cheat tools will allow the studio to identify cheaters that were previously difficult to detect, and it'll also "proactively counter advanced cheats, reducing the damage caused by illegal software".</p>

<p>The studio also confirms that the new anti-cheat technology will only run while you're playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, and will immediately shut itself down once you exit the game. That feels like it should be fairly standard behavior for anti-cheat tools, but it's a nice reassurance all the same.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that you probably shouldn't use other anti-cheat solutions at the same time as this tool is running. Krafton says that doing so could cause "system conflicts or unexpected behavior", including "unexpected issues during launch or gameplay".</p>

<p>In future, Krafton says it intends to "advance [its] illegal software countermeasures by combining technological innovation with operational efficiency", so there's likely more anti-cheat stuff on the way, especially if this system proves to have flaws in day-to-day running.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=dCIb2-YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=2NlK6hxJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>isn't slowing its anti-cheat implementation any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in March, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">shared its 2025 roadmap</a> for&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, promising big updates to the game's world, more destructible terrain, and plenty of other improvements. The studio also reported <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024" rel="nofollow">record-breaking sales and profits</a> for its 2024-25 fiscal year back in February.</p>

<p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s future, the game isn't just getting the aforementioned roadmap features; it'll also play host to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">some kind of&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> courtesy of developer Starbreeze, and it'll also serve as a proving ground for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">plans when it comes to generative AI</a>.</p>

              <p>Are video game discs popping free of their spindles more often than ever before? That seems to be what some users believe. And what does Samoa Joe think about the recent<em> Battlefied 6</em> open beta? Did he like it? Oh, and everyone loves that new horror movie <em>Weapons</em>, so it’s interesting to hear that the director’s next project might be a really weird and totally fresh take on<em> Resident Evil</em>. All this news and more is featured in today’s hot and ready Morning Checkpoint!</p> <h2>What’s Up With Loose Discs In Video Game Cases?</h2> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/app.bsky.feed.post/3lvvy4i6q5226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigpnazgvm6tzssz5gsjj4yfkqgu7i2qk77wmr56nvaj5oms5lr5yi"> <p lang="en">I would love for someone to do an Investigative Journalism into why most disc-based games are just rattling around loose in their case when purchased brand new vs affixed to the spindle. This never happened until toward the end of the PS4 era, and now it's basically every game I feel?</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532?ref_src=embed">Brandon Sheffield (@brandon.insertcredit.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3lvvy4i6q5226?ref_src=embed">2025-08-08T19:24:13.437Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Have you bought a new physical video game in the last few years and noticed that the disc was rattlin’ around inside the plastic case? If so, you aren’t alone. Other people have been commenting on this phenomenon, which was brought to my attention via a BlueSky post by Necrosoft Games Director Brandon Sheffield. According to Sheffield, this has been a growing problem since around the final years of the PS4. Others chimed in, sharing that they too had bought a game and found it loose in the case. Many theories have been provided, including changes in plastic, cheaper plastics being used, and less human involvement in packing physical media. Personally, I’d say all of those play a part in games being loose in the case.</p> <p>Oddly, I’ve mostly avoided this problem when buying new movies and games, but I will admit that when pulling out a new game in 2025, those suckers just pop right out with no force. Meanwhile, I needed to use the jaws of life to pry out PS2 games back when I was younger. So something has seemingly changed, that’s for sure.</p>

 <h2>Look At These New <em>Sonic</em>-Themed Shoes</h2>  <p>These upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed Puma sneakers were announced <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">earlier this month</a>, but somehow I didn’t see them until now via social media posts about the cool shoes. These are honestly some rad-looking sneakers, with one big exception: The face bits on each shoe representing the character the shoe is based on. I get it, Sega wants some more branding on the sneakers, but it turns these shoes into cheap-looking things you’d buy on Amazon for $10 a day before your nephew’s 12th birthday party. Anyway, these new sneakers are arriving on October 30.</p> <h2>Samoa Joe Shares His Thoughts On The<em> Battlefield 6</em> Beta</h2> <p>All of my friends played the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta over the weekend. And a lot of people I know online played, too. It seemed like everyone was playing it, including Samoa Joe. Yes, the famous wrestler and actor apparently played a lot of EA’s upcoming FPS over its open beta weekend and <a href="https://x.com/SamoaJoe/status/1954544594483318926">shared his thoughts on social media</a>, saying: “Is the new <em>Battlefield</em> kinda hitting for anyone else, or was the bar so low I’m just grateful? I’m really rooting for the former over the latter.” You are correct, Mr. Joe, the new <em>BF6</em> indeed hits.</p> <h2>Indie <em>Persona</em>-Like RPG Finally Has A Release Date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-launches-september-3">Necrosoft Games recently announced</a> that its upcoming game, <em>Demonschool</em>, finally has a release date. The “school life strategy RPG” arrives September 3. <em>Demonschool</em>, which looks a lot like a never-before-released Game Boy Advance port of a <em>Persona</em> game (in a good way), will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>

 <h2><em>Weapons</em> Director Says His <em>Resident Evil</em> Movie Will Be Weird</h2> <p>The biggest movie in America right now is <em>Weapons</em>, a strange horror film from writer and director Zach Cregger. And it just so happens that Cregger’s next project is likely a <em>Resident Evil</em> movie. Cregger, who also created the hit horror flick <em>Barbarian</em>, recently spoke to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em> about his video game adaptation</a> and had this to say: “[<em>Resident Evil</em> is] an original screenplay. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other <em>Resident Evil</em> movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.” As someone who finds all the past <em>Resident Evil</em> movies to be dumb, mostly bad action flicks, I’m totally fine with someone coming in to make an actual horror movie based on the franchise. Let’s hope Cregger nails it.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">People used cheats and wallhacks in the <em>BF6</em> beta (Don’t tell Samoa Joe)&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo IV</em> boss Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633">Don’t worry, we ranked every song from Netflix’s massive hit movie <em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em></a></li> </ul>  <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>The new <em>Spider-Man</em> movie has been filming for only a few days, but Sony and Marvel already have a trailer.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Day One on Set" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ymmwq55sHY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

In particular, people are sharing their thoughts on the game's aim-assist and destruction elements, and now some developers from Battlefield Studios have weighed in.</p><p>On the subject of Battlefield's trademark destruction elements, some people noticed that players who are inside a building as it comes crashing down don't sustain health damage immediately. As it turns out, that's by design.

<p>Sirland said it would be simply "not fun" and "too random" for players to take damage or die immediately when a room crumbles around them. Instead, the game was intentionally designed to give players a window to escape a busted-out room. "Stay under rubble falling and you'll see. Most for bigger parts," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6845">And as with Battlefield 6's other elements</a>, the destruction-damage will be "tuned" ahead of launch, Sirland said.</p><p>As for aim-assist, community manager <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1954437485217333734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kevin Johnson reacted to a video</a> showing the differences between aim-assist in Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 6. A single video doesn't tell the whole story and may not be representative of every person's experience, but many have said Call of Duty's aim-assist is more active than Battlefield's. Johnson, for his part, said Battlefield 6 isn't doing anything significantly differently than any past title has. "It is there to assist, and it should guide you during heated moments so that you're able to be in fair standing towards other peripheral users, but not above. YOU are the skill," he said.</p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta recently wrapped up its first weekend of testing, and it was a huge success, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">eclipsing Call of Duty player numbers. </a>Weekend 2 begins August 14, and it includes more maps and modes.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches in full on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

		<p>Bandai Namco and Now Production have released a graphics comparison video for Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, ahead of its launch across PS5 and PS4, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on 26th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="PAC-MAN WORLD 2 Re-PAC - Official Graphics Comparison Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3cvveUuVYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac is a faithful remake of the early 2000s 3D platformer. The Ghosts have snuck into Pac-Village and stolen the Golden Fruit, freeing their ghost king, Spooky, and forcing Pac-Man to travel the lands to reclaim the fruit and foil his plans.</p>
<p>Originally released for PS2, GameCube, Xbox and PC, the game is getting a serious glow up with this remake, with Now Production giving a solid modernised take on the source levels and themes, adding a ton more detail and more nuanced lighting.</p>
<p>But it goes beyond that, as they promise new actions for Pac-Man, updated boss battles,&nbsp;characters, collectables, customisations, and a 2-player mode.</p>

<p>Kickstart to your weekend?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>There's something about side-scrolling BMX/motorbike games, don't you agree? They promise big silly accidents, skill-based gameplay that's easy to parse, violent falls from mid-air, fun stunts, incredibly painful crashes and... well, yeah, just loads of falling and people getting rag-dolled.</p>
<p>Now, we've got some good BMX stuff on Switch already, and especially in the form of the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a>, but we could certainly do with more, and so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mad_skills_bmx_2">Mad BMX Skills 2</a> may be of interest to any budding [insert BMX rider] out there!</p>
<p>Launching on Switch on <strong>15th August 2025</strong> for just <strong>$9.99 / £9.99</strong>, the game — created by Swedish dev Turborilla — has been around on IOS for a few years now. It's great to see it supports 2-player local fun, as that's always a huge bonus in these sorts of things, and it also has a bunch of cosmetics and unlockables alongside gameplay that, from the trailer at least, looks very decent indeed. Also, boss battles? We'll have some of that.</p>
<p>Can it best Trials Rising by performing at 60fps on Switch 1, well, that remains to be seen, but it would certainly be a feather in its cap if it did.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some further info and a few screens from the official PR release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mad Skills MBX 2 features dozens of hand-crafted tracks and 7 different BMX bikes. Players can also customize their rider and bike to suit their style.</p>
<p>In Career Mode, players compete against both standard opponents and challenging bosses. A local multiplayer mode is available as well, allowing two players to race head-to-head on the same console.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Skills BMX 2 – main features:</strong></p>
<p>arcade-style BMX racing;<br>
7 unique BMX bikes;<br>
dozens of varied tracks;<br>
boss battles in career mode;<br>
local 2-player multiplayer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writer spent a lot of his youth watching stuff like BMX Beat and Kickstart on TV in the 1980s, so he knows BMX games have always been about the fine balance between the falling and the skills. The ragdolling and the quality of challenge laid before you can see this sort of game either take off, like Elliott and his magical pals in <strong>ET</strong>, or wind up a bit more like Evil Knievel.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab Mad BMX Skills 2 on the eShop later this week.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>'s engine was updated with features lifted from later versions of the engine to enable PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features like PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution support.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, Ninja Theory's Technical Director Gavin Costello goes over the work that went into porting the second entry in the series to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, saying that the process was more about porting the technology than the game specifically. Taking advantage of the very good platform integration Epic has in place, the team had no trouble getting the game running and fully playable from beginning to end on Sony's consoles and getting an overview of where the game's performance was. From this point, the developer implemented every feature of the game into the new versions of the game, and also updated the older version of Unreal Engine 5 the game shipped on with new features taken from newer version of the engine to enable some PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features, like PSSR and variable rate shading. Considering the launch of the PlayStation 5 version of the game will coincide with the release of a new update for the Xbox Series version which introduces a 60 FPS performance mode on Xbox Series X, it is likely these new features have allowed the implementation of 60 FPS gameplay into this version of the game.</p>

<p>Introducing a Performance Mode on Xbox Series X is only <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/">one of the new features</a> that will hit Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II with tomorrow's update. On PC, this new version of the game will introduce a Very High preset that pushes visual fidelity further, as well as Steam Deck verification featuring optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the system. The update will also introduce a new play mode and other improvements.</p>



<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The PlayStation 5 port, as well as the Enhanced update, will launch tomorrow, August 12.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> got a surprise launch for Steam and Switch during last Thursday’s Nintendo indie presentation. As the name implies, you run a tiny bookshop in a seaside town, meeting the locals and recommending books to them.</p><p>Your bookshop is run out of a cart attached to a car, meaning that every day you have to decide where you’ll set up shop. People at different locations want different kinds of books: beachgoers want fantasy and kids books, while folks at the coffee shop want classics and drama. The sailors at the waterfront want travel books, while the students at the university want non-fiction. After you visit a place for the first time, their preferences are kept in your journal, and there’s a pleasant pre-departure ritual of stocking your shelves with the kinds of books your potential customers like best.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tiny Bookshop – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2i_HlDVtQRk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You can also boost the sales of specific books with decorative items around the shop. A skull will increase the sales chance of crime, for instance, while a vintage bell will boost the sale of classics. Some items will boost one sales chance while diminishing another, and all of these items will add a small cost to your daily expenses. New items, as well as more books, can be purchased at the weekly flea market or from a day’s edition of the town paper, where you’ll also find the weather forecast and upcoming town events.</p><p>There’s a light narrative atop all this in the form of various recurring characters, who give you small quests to complete as you get to know them. I didn’t personally find any of these characters terribly compelling–they wear their motivations pretty nakedly, and they glom onto you as a newcomer to town with an intimacy I found a bit too fast, but this all makes sense for the limited interactions you can have with them and for the story the game wants to tell about how relationships are formed in a small town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite part of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> has been the book recommendation system. While characters will mostly handle their own browsing and buying, every so often a character will ask you to recommend a specific book to them. These can be a straightforward request for a short romance or recent kids book, or it can be a more complex preference that could span genres. You scan your shelves for whatever’s turned up or still left, most of which are real books, and then offer them a book you think will meet their needs. If it does, in addition to getting to feel clever about it, the sale will give you a short boost that encourages other patrons to buy more books.</p><figure><figcaption>Neoludic Games</figcaption></figure><p>Besides breaking up gameplay that is largely just watching NPCs buy things, I loved flipping through the titles on my shelves and trying to think of what a character might like or not like. Sometimes the requests are hilarious– one character, with a kid in tow according to their dialogue, disturbingly asked me if I had “anything like <em>American Psycho</em>.” There’s also a lot of humor potential in what you can suggest; I skimmed to Elliot Page’s tragically-titled memoir <em>Pageboy</em> when I was looking for a book for a character who told me “I’m looking for a new hobby,” leading me to ponder whether transitioning is a hobby. I became determined to sell someone <em>Titus Andronicus</em> regardless of age level, or <em>Annihilation</em> when someone asked for a romance with a happy ending. (It didn't work.) Their responses will also sometimes be unintentionally funny: One character, looking for a long book, scolded me when I suggested <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Moby Dick</em></a> because it wasn’t long enough, and another, looking for a romance, reacted with delight like I’d found them the most obscure book in the world when I suggested one of Shakespeare’s romantic comedies. It helps if you know the books, though they also have pretty solid summaries to help you make your decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a literature person, a pretty solid assumption if you’re playing a game about books, making book recommendations is really fun and thought-provoking, and it’s super satisfying when you get one right. You won’t always have something appropriate on hand, especially if it’s been a busy day and your shelves are looking bare, but nothing in <em>Tiny Bookshop </em>is too punishing if you mess it up.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is broken into seasons; I’ve just completed summer, which ends with a surprisingly introspective bonfire. The gameplay has felt a little shallow and repetitive to me at times, but the book recommendations break this up, and, like many “cozy” simulation games, it feels like it’s more about chilling with the vibes than exploring the reality of running a business. (<a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank god</a>.) I’ve been playing it on PC, but it definitely feels like a game best suited to chilling on your couch, fiddling with your shop decor and flipping through your wares to unwind. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo on Steam</a> if you want to check it out first.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let’s Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin’s Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.
