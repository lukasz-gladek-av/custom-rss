			<p>The ancient mythological world depicted by Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a fascinating one. Set during the late Ming Period, an era of great sweeping change in China when ineffective leadership resulted in famine, rebellion, and war, the game is also imbued with mythological elements inspired by the amazing discoveries found in the Sanxingdui archaeological site. Some of these bronze relics featured mysterious half-bird half-human creatures, leading to the concept of ‘Feathering Disease’ that provides the basis for the game’s story. This horrific plague transforms those poor saps afflicted into hideous, mutated beasts, rampaging around the place and leaving chaos in their wake. That’s where the player steps in, cast as Bai Wuchang – a butt-kicking pirate – they must cut their way through hordes of demons to save the people of the land in this third-person action Soulslike.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMMMNGV9LqI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s just one problem for Wuchang as she embarks on her quest: she’s gone and caught herself the Feathering Disease too. Thankfully, like a dose of man flu, it doesn’t seem that bad for her. Sure, Wuchang starts to get a bit feathery and her eyes turn red, but that’s about it. The disease seems to just vanish, only to turn up again later for reasons unknown. In fact, this is one of the main issues that I had in my time with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, as I had absolutely no idea what was going on. In part, this is due to poor translation, the game failing to explain its core mechanics effectively, but it’s also due to many of those mechanics seemingly not being implemented fully, perhaps due to time or budget.</p>


<p>There’s a suggestion that the Feathering Disease will corrupt you, turn you into a mindless, murderous Big Bird, but that never comes to pass. Die and respawn a few times and the disease will disappear, your symptoms abating. Apparently, you deal more damage yet are more vulnerable when the disease is rampant in your body, yet I never noticed any tangible difference.</p>
<p>There are various items to collect that will ease your feathering, shrines to pray at to relieve your symptoms, but these are seemingly irrelevant, I never needed to use any of them, not once. More confusingly, the few survivors you meet don’t seem concerned in the slightest about your mutation, barely reacting to your glowing red evil eyes and feathery protrusions. It’s strange that so much fuss is made about Wuchang being afflicted by the Feathering Disease, so many mechanics and items devoted to managing it, and yet it’s so easily ignored.</p>


<p>What you are left with, without the intrigue of the Feathering Disease, is a bog-standard Soulslike. You wander around the maze-like environment, killing creatures, finding the bonfire-like shrines, and dying on numerous occasions to a big bad boss. Rinse and repeat. Combat, for the most part, is flat, uninspired, and oddly dull. This is mostly down to the enemies you face, which, despite intriguing designs, are made up of the same muddy brown textures as the environment around them. You face a handful of enemy types again and again, each using the same two or three attack combos at their disposal ad infinitum. The AI is dumb to a hilarious extent, enemies often failing to get through doorways, falling off cliffs to try to reach you, or getting trapped behind very small objects in an endless loop of walking-animation.</p>
<p>Wuchang can find a variety of weapons to use, but most of them are absolutely pants, with weird attack patterns that serve no discernible purpose. Indeed, I just stuck with the basic sword from beginning to end, with no real need to swap it out. Unlockable spells and special attacks are at Wuchang’s disposal, but the visuals that accompany their use are lacklustre and strangely understated, lacking the bombastic energy they would need to alleviate the combat tedium that soon sets in. Again, most of the specials are simply unnecessary and ineffective. The standard blink attack works the best and will serve you well enough without needing to even give the others a try.</p>

<p>Occasionally Wuchang: Fallen Feathers can be very pretty with wide-open vistas spreading far into the distance, but most of the time it insists you hang out in dreary caves and identikit villages. The level design is confused and unclear, not helped by samey visual assets being reused, leading to me getting lost. A lot. Not in the fun kind of lost that you feel when you are exploring a fascinatingly complex and mysterious virtual world, but where you just can’t find your way out of a teeny temple. More problematically, the game is borderline unplayable at times on PS5 due to gnarly lag and framerate drops in anything but Performance Mode, and even then, it still drags its heels on occasion.</p>
<p>Boss fights are by far the best part of the game. These hulking grotesque behemoths are much more interesting to fight than the multitudes of foe fodder that precedes them, with genuinely challenging attack patterns to overcome. Even here though, there are problems. All too often when bosses attack, they get distracted and attack the thin air around you because, well, they’ve been driven mad by the feathering disease I suppose? Or is it some naff AI rearing its unwanted head again?</p>

<p>Collison detection is questionable too, bosses causing damage despite missing you entirely. This is a problem throughout the game, with attacks rarely cancelling each other out, meaning both you and your foe lose health, even though you hit them first. The frustrating part is, they cause way more damage than you do.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is an intriguing ideal spoiled by poor implementation, with nearly every aspect of the game needing a thorough reworking. This is a game that required way more time in development before seeing the light of day.</p>

<p>Following the launch of Mario Kart World</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Toadette" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddc951ecba813/toadette.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it's clear the restrictions on the voice actor reveals for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> have officially lifted at this point, and more of the talent is now revealing who they played in the Switch 2 launch title.</p>
<p>Following the update on Peach yesterday (and also who voiced the NPC Toads in the game), we've now got the confirmation of the main Toad's voice actor. This character is played by Laila Berzins and was formerly voiced by Samantha Kelly.</p>
<p>Berzin's officially confirmed this in an announcement on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am overjoyed to be able to finally announce that I voice Toad in MarioKartWorld. Being a part of such an iconic franchise, let alone one of my favorite characters is a dream come true.</p>
<p>I am so inspired by the magnificient Toads before me; Jen Taylor and Samantha Kelley. The gaming community owes them a huge debt of gratitude for the years they've spent bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>I hope to do this little mushroom proud! He’s a fun guy! Get it? Fungi? Anyway…Immensely grateful to Nintendo America and cupofteastudios. “Here we go!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, Laura Stahl has confirmed she's playing Toadette in Mario Kart World. Here's what she had to say about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"peeking out of a social media hiatus to share that I am the voice of Toadette in mariokartworld! grateful to Cupofteaprod and NintendoAmerica for the opportunity! im still in disbelief, and so, so grateful"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see the names of all these voice actors in the Mario Kart World credits, although their specific character roles are not listed.</p>

			<p>Soulike games are truly everywhere nowadays. Back when FromSoftware's Souls series did not have the immense popularity it enjoys nowadays, the release of any game inspired by the series was an event in itself. However, today's increased offerings for hardcore action RPGs have led to some stagnation for the genre. While many Souslike games released in the past few years are solid games, very few of them are true standouts, as the vast majority of these games opt to stay within the boundaries of a tried and true formula that is starting to get a little tiring.</p>



<p>In this regard, Leenzee Games' Wuchang: Fallen Feathers definitely doesn't break the mold. While the game is a more than competent Soulslike featuring solid combat mechanics and a twist on the genre's typical character progression, it doesn't feature anything that makes it stand out from the competition, making some of its issues even more evident. This is not to say that it is a bad game by any means, just that someone who's experiencing Soulslike fatigue may not find the game particularly interesting.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250710000149_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers' setting is among the game's standout features</figcaption></figure>



<p>When it comes to the setting, at least, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sets itself apart from most games with its identity deeply steeped in Chinese history, lore, and mythology. Taking on the role of the amnesiac pirate warrior Wuchang, players will accompany her on a journey to reclaim her lost memories and find a cure for the Feathering disease that is ravaging the land. For some reason, Wuchang shows incredible resistance to the monstrous mutations this disease causes, allowing her to continue her investigation into the causes of the affliction and of a cure, without becoming a monster herself. </p>



<p>Supporting her is a varied cast of characters whose individual stories develop as the adventure proceeds, and simple side quests are completed, including recovering items or defeating certain enemies. The story and lore are further developed by documents scattered all over the game's world, item descriptions, and some environmental storytelling, which is generally well crafted, though it never reaches the heights of some other titles. Unfortunately, the story is never truly the focus of the experience. It tends to be a little predictable, never moving past the boundaries of the genre, but, at the very least, it gets its job done for those who wish to follow it, while hardly becoming an impediment for those who are only in for the action. However, those who are more invested in it will be more rewarded with the multiple endings the game features, which are rather different from one another.</p>



<p>Much like with the setting and narrative, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers doesn't innovate much within its genre, but it does what it does well enough. Controlling Wuchang with a third-person view, players explore a variety of intricately designed locations filled with powerful enemies and all sorts of traps, collecting gear and weapons on the way and using the obtained experience points, Red Mercury Essence, to level up at small shrine checkpoints.</p>



<p>In regards to character progression and gear, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers attempts to do things slightly differently, succeeding in providing a system that successfully deviates from the Soulslike norm. Instead of granting a single stat upgrade decided by the player, leveling up in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers grants the ability to unlock a single node in an extensive skill tree called Impetus Repository divided into different areas related to regular character progression. This includes improvements for the Manna Vase, the main healing tool which works similarly to the Souls series' flasks, and the Swift Draw ability, an extremely handy ability that allows Wuchang to switch between the two equipped weapons on the fly while unleashing a powerful special ability unique to the equipped weapon by consuming one charge of Skyborn Might (the main resource used to unleash Discipline Skills and powerful magic spell), and weapon type progression, which include stat increases, Mastery nodes requiring additional items to unlock, and extra abilities like new Discipline skills and passive skills that can profoundly change the playstyle of any weapon type. They can add passive abilities like clashing to specific attacks, allowing players to use them to parry attacks, stacks of other passive abilities that grant increased stats, the ability to gain Skyborn Might charges by performing certain attacks, and more. The ability to respec Wuchang at any shrine is also a great quality of life feature that makes it easier to experiment with different builds and playstyles.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250710013300_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers plot is further developed by interacting with NPCs and completing sidequests for them</figcaption></figure>



<p>Being able to experiment with builds without going through too many hurdles is only one of the reasons why WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers's combat system is one of the game's best features, if not the very best. Unlike your typical Soulslike, where the first few hours are made painfully difficult by the limited amount of combat options available, Wuchang is a competent warrior from the beginning of the adventure, thanks to the aforementioned Skyborn Might resource, which, at the start of the game, can only be obtained by perfectly dodging enemy attacks, but later on can be obtained by using certain attacks with all available weapon types - one handed swords, longsword, dual blades, axes and spears. While it is entirely possible to deal with most enemies using the varied light attack strings and the heavy attacks offered by each weapon type, it's by acquiring and using Skyborn Might that the combat system gets to a whole another level, as Weapon Skills, skills locked to a particular weapon, Discipline Skills, skills that can be assigned to any weapon of the same type, and magic spells can be seamlessly woven into any attack string. </p>



<p>As many of these skills can actually stagger, launch in the air, or knock an enemy down, these mechanics incentivize players to always be on the offensive and use these Skyborn Might-fueled abilities to prevent enemies from attacking Wuchang while keeping the offensive going. In some ways, these combat intricacies are more reminiscent of Team NINJA's masocore ARPGs like the Nioh series and Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, although with a slower pace that's closer in feel to the classic FromSoftware games. Unfortunately, this slower place sometimes feels more sluggish than slow, as there's some easily noticeable input delay, which is especially annoying when attempting to perform perfect dodges, as the timing doesn't feel very natural if you are more used to snappier games like the aforementioned Team NINJA games.</p>



<p>With Wuchang being rather competent right from the start of the adventure, enemy design had to take her abilities into account. However, there's still decent spread of enemies between weaker and stronger ones, though balancing is sometimes off, as weak enemies are generally some real pushovers, while some of the stronger enemies can feel a little bit overturned at times, as their movesets incorporate some natural dodges that can make it challenging to find a window of opportunity and take advantage of it. Enemy placement is generally decent, although the game still features enemies hidden behind corners and some difficult-to-reach ranged attackers, but they are generally manageable. What isn't, on the other hand, are select enemies found in some location that are either completely hidden until Wuchang gets near them, or that have a color palette which makes them blend with the environment, making it difficult to spot them and even understand what they are attempting to do while they are being attacked. This can sound a little like nitpicking, but the difference is stark with games that have a much better visual clarity, which makes it easier to keep track of what is going on. Bosses are generally well-designed, varied, and, most of all, challenging, thankfully not to the point of frustration like those in some recent Soulslikes. </p>



<p>Adding some more complexity to the WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers experience are a few other mechanics, including the Tempering mechanics, which allow players to add a variety of passive bonuses to weapons for further build refining, and the Inner Demon mechanics. The latter are particularly interesting, taking advantage of Wuchang's Feathering affliction to provide a risk and reward system. By fighting certain types of enemies, Wuchang's madness level increases and decreases, and after surpassing certain thresholds, certain skills learned via the Impetus Repository become active. If madness completely overtakes the young warrior, however, her attack power will increase at the cost of her defense, rewarding players who know how to properly defend against enemies. At the same time, getting defeated by an enemy at full madness will make Wuchang's Inner Demon manifest where she was previously defeated. While defeating the Inner Demon is the only way to recover the lost Red Mercury, leaving her be for a while is definitely a viable strategy, as she also attacks nearby enemies, providing players with new means to deal with a particularly strong foe. For example, you can let the Inner Demon and some enemies in the wear each other out, and then swoop in to finish them off and reap some rewards.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250715142606_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers' combat system is intense and quite fun</figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides combat, the other central element of any Soulslike is the level design, but in this regard, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers fares considerably worse. For starters, locations aren't exciting, except for a few that take good advantage of its setting, so you will be traversing the usual selection of ruined villages, spooky forests and dilapidated wastelands seen in a lot of other games, although there's a minor attempt at creating a bigger interconnected world in the vein of the original Dark Souls that is appreciated, and there are some definite standouts in terms of visual design, although not many. Their layouts, closer to Team NINJA's games rather than the Souls series, are not particularly remarkable either, as the game's locations are mostly linear, with a few branching paths that are not always rewarding to explore, not counting the handful of times when new gear is obtained. Unlike a few other games, finding new gear here is quite rewarding, as defensive affinities are critical to survive most bosses' attacks. Better yet, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers features a very simple transmogrification system, so any new gear a player finds unlocks visual customization options right away, of which I'm sure many will take advantage of during the around 40 hours needed to complete a single playthrough.</p>



<p>If one can look past the average level design of the game, which is ultimately not so terrible as to heavily impact the good WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers offers, looking past the game's middling performance on PC will be much harder for most. As the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-final-pc-requirements-dlss-fsr/">final system requirements suggested</a>, upscaling and frame generation may be a necessity for many system configurations to run the game at above 60 FPS, which is a little surprising considering the good-looking but not exceptional visuals. On my machine (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution with DLAA and high settings at an average of 37 FPS, 24 1% low, without frame generation in a benchmark session held in the Palace Hill area found around 10 hours into the game. Things fared better at 1440p resolution, hitting the 70, 75 FPS mark often, but it's only with Frame Generation that my system was able to hit to run the game at the maximum refresh rate of my monitor, 120 Hz, at this resolution. The tests above were conducted before NVIDIA launched a new driver optimized for the game, so performance could be better when the game officially launches to the public.</p>



<p>Frame Generation and NVIDIA DLSS set at Quality Mode using the slider found in the settings delivered better framerates in the same location, averaging 103 FPS, 32 1% low, but never hitting the 120 FPS cap. Even if it is possible to get a high refresh rate experience using upscalers and frame generation, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers never feels very smooth, as the game suffers from some evident micro stuttering. Thankfully, there are no gigantic stutters, but the game often feels choppy, especially during fast camera movements. Those who cannot use NVIDIA DLSS have the choice of using either AMD FSR or UE5's TSR, and the presence of an oversampling resolution slider allows a greater degree of customization to help the user strike a better balance between image quality and performance.</p>

<p>Despite a bit of Soulslike fatigue, I enjoyed my time with WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, though I often found myself wondering what the game could have been with a few tweaks and improvements. That said, considering this is Leenzee Games' first attempt at a Soulslike, they’ve delivered commendably, especially in the combat department, which is powered by interconnected mechanics that work quite well. As such, I  hope the Chinese studio will get the chance to develop a sequel that smooths out the rough edges, because the potential for a standout Soulslike is clearly there.</p>

				<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a solid Soulslike offering an interesting setting steeped in Chinese history and lore, and well-crafted interwoven mechanics that power satisfying combat. However, uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware's catalog of exceptional action RPGs has garnered critical acclaim, and as a result, spawned the Soulslike subgenre, known for its exceptionally high difficulties, expansive worlds filled with diverse enemies, a methodical approach to combat, and a dark fantasy or mythological worldbuilding. Outside of the FromSoftware games, we've seen plenty of successful Soulslike games like <em>Darksiders 3</em>, <em>Remnant</em>, <em>Code Vein</em>, the <em>Star Wars Jedi</em> games, and recent releases like <em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>, <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>, and <em>Lies of P</em>. Now we have a new entry with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date" rel="nofollow">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a></em>.</p>

<p>Developer Leenzee looks to join its fellow contemporaries with their latest action RPG release, putting their unique, refreshing take on the Soulslike subgenre by delighting players with a vibrant world, engaging combat mechanics, challenging bosses, and a formidable protagonist in which their <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wuchang-fallen-feathers-preview" rel="nofollow">"portrayal of historical events aligns with mainstream historiography," according to game director Xia Siyuan</a>. With all of this in mind, have the developers produced a game that lives up to the expectations of another classic Soulslike game, and can <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> stand out from its counterparts?</p>

<h2>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Review - A New Soulslike Journey Begins</h2>

<p>Following its official reveal, <em>Wuchang</em> has drawn comparisons to a myriad of Soulsborne and Soulslike games, including <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, as well as Game Science's action RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. While many believe the comparisons are primarily positive, developer Leenzee seeks to give <em>Wuchang</em> its own identity.</p>

(Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://wuchanggame.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-xbox-games-showcase-reveal/" rel="nofollow">game's story follows its protagonist, Bai Wuchang</a>, who embarks on a life-threatening journey while exploring the areas of the ancient Shu kingdom during the late Ming Dynasty that have been ravaged by war and a contagion called The Feathering. Unfortunately, for our protagonist, she awakens to this world suffering from amnesia, and she is afflicted with The Feathering, which has gripped the Shu region and is mutating anyone who comes into contact with it.</p>

<p>Bai Wuchang thus explores this region in the pursuit of truth and learns how The Feathering came into existence through steel, blood, and magical powers as she plows her way through contorted enemies and ferocious bosses in the hope of finding a cure to purge this contagion. Luckily for her, she has the guidance of various NPCs along with an arsenal of weapons, a collection of spells, and skill trees to utilize on top of the game's unique combat systems to aid her in perhaps the deadliest mission she has embarked on by facing mutated enemies, ferocious area bosses, and her Inner Demon.</p>

<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> Review -&nbsp; Feather Of Truth Behind The Madness</h2>

<p>Exploration and traversal in <em>Wuchang</em> is what many will anticipate from an action RPG or Soulslike game, as the game follows a non-linear structure, boasting interconnected areas governed by a foreboding boss. The environments are beautiful and vibrant, which is a deviation from previous Soulslike games, which can be tonally dark and depressive, and the various characters that inhabit this world have varying personalities that either add to its vibrancy or depressive state and overall distinctive charm.</p>

<p>There are temples that can be found during her journey, but one in particular, the Shu Temple, acts as a central hub for much of the early game's campaign. Many of the game's important NPCs can be found here, providing relevant information or offering unique items and valuables for sale or to sell back to them for Red Mercury; the latter is used for upgrading character and weapon stats, unlocking nodes, and more.</p>

While temples serve as an important hub in Bai Wuchang's journey, Shrines function as a save point, a teleport system to fast travel to other discovered Shrines she finds, and importantly, the Character Menu allows players to unlock and upgrade character and weapon stats and deposit items away.</p>

<p><a href="https://wuchanggame.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-2024-showcase-trailer-gameplay-bosses-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The game's combat system is one of the major gameplay aspects emphasized by the developers, as seen in multiple game trailers</a>, and has been designed to create magical and spectacular showcases and moments. Throughout her daring quest to learn the truth about The Feathering, Bai Wuchang has access to a range of weapons found throughout the world or acquired from enemies, bosses, and shop vendors, as well as spellcasting and skills.</p>

<p>These can be used in conjunction with the Skyborn Might and Temper systems, with Tempering allowing players to imbue their weapons with enhanced abilities through needles, while Skyborn Might is a valuable resource that enhances weapon abilities and spells but reduces their power. Additionally, Benedictions can also enhance various weapon abilities like blocking and counters, or character traits like stamina recovery or reduced damage taken when equipped.</p>

Madness is a modifier that gradually builds when defeating specific enemies or dying too frequently and near or at its max, it increases Bai Wuchang's damage output but also increases the damage she takes.</p>

<p>This is indicated onscreen by the <em>"Madness Descends"</em> demonic mark and her eyes glowing red, but at the site of her last death, her Inner Demon will spawn, attacking everything within the vicinity. Defeating the Inner Demon is rewarding as it cleanses her Madness (which there is an item that can cleanse it), but it also awards her with the Red Mercury she lost before her death.</p>

<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> Review - Ruffling Up Some Feathers</h2>

<p>During my experience with <em>Wuchang</em>, I encountered a few issues alongside some bugs, glitches, and technical/performance errors that either caught me off-guard or left me in a state of confusion. Granted, when I wasn't fighting for my life by clearing enemy mobs or bosses or paying attention to the story, it was also spent dying quite a lot and in rather spectacular fashion (RIP to me platforming at Narrow Stretch chasing after a Bamboozling).</p>

<p>One issue that concerned me was the developers not having or utilizing a better option to explain the core gameplay features and combat mechanics, especially pertaining to Madness, Skyborn Might, and the Tempering systems. As a subtle request, players will spend a considerable amount of time reading about many of the game's features and mechanics once they're unlocked, and I feel there are better implementations to get players familiarized with these features and mechanics.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-39.jpg?itok=14LqTGmr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-39.jpg?itok=JU84TMAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can unlock Weapon Skills and enhance their character stats and weapon abilities via the skill tree, which they must spend Red Mercury Essence. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>Much of this information is listed in the Help section, where players can read more or discover something new about these core gameplay features and mechanics below the System Help tab. This feels like a chore, having to switch between gameplay and the System Help tab all too frequently, which can potentially hurt the gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Performance-wise, there were few issues experienced other than the occasional input lag; however, given that this game is quoted as having "<em>high-fidelity visuals,"</em><strong><em> </em></strong>this could be an issue impacting gameplay (and not just visuals) for less powerful PCs. Character movement actions, such as sprinting and combat, will also be affected; however, for the best possible experience, toggle any or most graphics settings to the lowest possible setting, which may result in a less engaging gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Lastly, as much as I do love a good Soulslike game with a deeply immersive world and storytelling, <em>Wuchang&nbsp;</em>has an intriguing story on its hands, but how it's being told is less enticing than some of its contemporaries. The story heavily focuses on learning the truth behind The Feathering while uncovering the stories of Bai Wuchang's past, it felt there wasn't enough done to get me hooked on the story, nor continue developing the game's world into its story, and Bai's character writing is less desirable despite some NPCs being more fleshed out than her.</p>

<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Leenzee's action RPG <em>Wuchang</em> has the potential of being yet another great Soulslike game outside of FromSoftware's catalog, much like its predecessors in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>, and <em>Lies of P</em>. Its worldbuilding, quick and engaging combat, and intriguing narrative, explored through its protagonist, show that the developer has hit all the right notes, while adding some refreshing takes and plenty of vibrancy to the Soulslike subgenre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/screenshot-10527.jpg?itok=xLsDL-iS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/screenshot-10527.jpg?itok=ob1IvCnW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The area boss battles will be challenging and brutal but they can be defeated by learning their attack patterns and countering them. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>The enemies and bosses are challenging, and the encounters are pretty brutal, but the game's combat systems nail the key essentials expected from an action RPG (and a Soulslike game, generally speaking). Players will heavily rely on dodging attacks unless they wield weapons that allow them to block, and the Madness mechanic is an exhilarating addition, adding more nuance to the overall combat, making attacks more powerful, but similarly, leaving the protagonist more vulnerable to enemies' attacks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some inconveniences do make understanding various features and in-game mechanics quite tedious, resulting in spending too much time reading entries or questioning NPCs, and may frustrate players if they're not paying attention. The narrative is deeply fascinating, but the writing, character portrayals, and how it conveys this story are some of the weaker aspects of the game that didn't quite stick the landing in some instances, but certain characters and dialogue will be remembered and loved by players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The mass departure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of Waypoint’s writers</a> and its managing editor over the last few days appears to signal, if not the end, then at least a major setback for the second chapter of the Vice-owned video game vertical. That time can generously be described as eventful, but those events didn’t come out of nowhere. The saga of Waypoint to date is the perfect encapsulation of the state of games media in 2025.</p><p>The version of Waypoint that existed before Monday was <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought back to life</a> in 2024 after the original site’s high-profile closure in 2023 (<a href="https://remapradio.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribe to Remap!</a>). It was weird from the start; <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke once described it as an entire publication hanging askew</a>. Its tone was off-centre, it courted controversy a few times (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milph.mom/post/3loz4zbn3nc2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most notably with a now-deleted story about right-wing VTubers</a>), and has now been seemingly done in by the ill-advised deletion of a couple more complicated stories and, following that move, resignations.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s start with the site’s original closure, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vice-shutting-down-waypoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resulting in layoffs affecting an entire crew of talented writers, who had garnered a loyal following</a> over years of hard work. Those writers built that following in spite of the stewardship of Vice Media, once at the forefront of a kind of edgy, youth-focused journalism that evolved over the years into a company that often did great work in the face of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/business/media/vice-sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workplace</a> scandals and <a href="https://defector.com/vices-avaricious-stewards-finally-succeeded-at-bleeding-it-dry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lavish executive pay</a>. Vice ultimately declared bankruptcy in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65462957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 2023</a>, shortly after closing Waypoint, and announced it would stop publishing and lay off most of its employees in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/02/22/vice-media-shuts-down-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2024</a>. Even this ultimate end saw <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vice-executive-bonues-bankruptcy_n_64ad6e10e4b0e5efaade4e08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">executives making out</a> like bandits, while many of the company’s rank-and-file employees have claimed they <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/VICEunion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t receive the severance</a> owed to them.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...while all stories were approved by an editor, many of them were edited after publication, and potentially sensitive stories were not given the pre-publication legal review often common at other outlets...</p></blockquote></figure><p>Vice as a brand was resurrected in May 2024 via <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/09/vice-media-relaunch-savage-ventures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a partnership with Savage Ventures</a>, and launched new versions of some of its sites including, in October 2024, Waypoint. Former Waypoint managing editor Dwayne Jenkins told Aftermath he suggested the name be changed, but ownership obviously disagreed. Formerly a site of staffed writers covered by a union contract with the Writers Guild of America, East, the new Waypoint saw Jenkins as its only staffed employee, bolstered by a handful of contributors who were paid $30 a post.</p><p>High-output sites primarily staffed by <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-paid freelancers</a> is a popular model across games writing these days, as the industry shifts from staffed, often unionized employees to <a href="https://aftermath.site/valnet-report-freelance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">networks where writers are paid dollars per story instead of a salary</a>. Jenkins came from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwayne-jenkins-a467801b9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites</a> in the Gamurs network, as did the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/ana-valens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rest </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaun-cichacki-651417ab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/matt-vatankhah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waypoint’s</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentrkoepp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writers</a>, some of whom also had experience at a similar network <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-employees-detail-hostile-work-environment-cbr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valnet</a>, as well as other outlets. Those networks’ sites specialize in aggregation, reviews, and content geared toward Google results; they seldom, if ever, do reporting or analysis of the type the new Waypoint attempted.</p><p>Which isn’t to say Waypoint’s writers weren’t capable of or hadn’t done those forms of writing before, or that they didn’t do that kind of work at Waypoint. But they faced an uphill battle at the site. Former Waypoint workers told Aftermath that while all stories were approved by an editor, many of them were edited after publication, and potentially sensitive stories were not given the pre-publication legal review often common at other outlets. Jenkins told Aftermath that post-publication edits were “the norm” in his experience at Gamurs, where he said he learned “many, many bad habits” and “never had a REAL Capital-J journalist mentor.”</p><p>“I had, ‘Oh God I gotta make sure this content is churned out!’ Gamurs practices, and you know, of course, that Gamurs wasn’t exactly in the business of teaching anyone anything.”</p><p>"Waypoint is not equipped to handle reporting like it has been doing," VGBees’ John Warren <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/floppyadult.com/post/3luid7xv4us24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>. "I think the story of those pieces being taken down is important, but you have to acknowledge that…very little in the way of editing can lead to really massive mistakes in journalism."</p><p>This lack of experience, overseen by a venture capital firm led, predictably, to disaster: Vice is being rightly criticised for pulling the stories, and the mass resignations that followed have hollowed out the site and left writers with one less source of income in a brutal time for anyone trying to making a living as a games writer. The intentions of the site’s workers were surely in the right place, but the new Waypoint’s life was rife with pulled stories and others that just came off as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-want-waypoints-return-to-be-like-the-silent-hill-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tonally weird</a>, all of it while facing scrutiny and distrust from readers who saw the site’s new staff working under the “Waypoint” banner as a betrayal to what the site once was.&nbsp;</p><p>How much of this is on Waypoint’s staff or owners, and how much of it is just emblematic of the systemic rot in video games media and the wider media landscape in general? The mass <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs </a>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site closures</a> of the last five years have sucked whole generations of experienced, talented writers out of the games media industry. It has also meant the loss of experienced editors and leaders as well, the kind of people who understand the legal and journalistic rigor that has to go into serious reporting. But even beyond traditional journalism, experienced editors can help writers make sure any piece and its language clearly communicates what the writer means. This in turn helps create stronger writers, who can then mentor other writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The current media collapse is awful for so many reasons,” veteran games writer Carli Velocci <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlivelocci.com/post/3luidbpwgdd2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>. “But the lack of institutional knowledge and experience shaping reporting and mentoring the next generation might be one of the worst ones.”</p><p>Not only are there less and less jobs for these kinds of editors–as the sites that are still standing pivot to search-optimized, low stakes content–but as Jenkins’ description of his time at Gamurs shows, there are also less leaders to teach new writers and editors how to <em>become</em> those kinds of writers and editors. The consequences of this spirals, as journalistic best practices are lost in the games writing field, and even experienced writers, critics, and reporters find themselves without the support they need to do their work, outlets willing to take that work on, and the living wage that makes that work possible.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Under what other circumstances would Waypoint have lurched back to life other than capitalistic necromancy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p>As former games journalist Ian Boudreau <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianboudreau.com/post/3luifohbuqc2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Individual writers aren't the problem, they should be working with editors who are equipped to give them useful feedback and guidance on how to build a compelling and legally sound story. That layer of the business is effectively extinct.”</p><p>For Waypoint’s writers, being paid roughly $30 per post is a shocking, though <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not unheard-of</a> rate, little more than minimum wage when you work out the time required to formulate and write articles. Pair that with an inexperienced managing editor and Waypoint’s high volume output (relative to its headcount) and it’s little wonder the site struggled. It’s a pipe dream to think Waypoint or Vice broadly would ever be brought back with proper leadership, an investment in full-time writers, and a commitment to strenuous reporting and thoughtful criticism made possible by paying and protecting staff. Ownership dug up a URL that clearly still had some cache, and they got exactly what they paid for. Which all sucks, but how else could this have gone down? Under what other circumstances would Waypoint have lurched back to life other than capitalistic necromancy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t talk about the story of new Waypoint without noting that, despite what an obviously unpopular idea bringing the site back was, writers agreed to write there and be paid so little for their work. As former <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fanbyte-hit-by-round-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fanbyte</a> writer Colette Arrand <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colettearrand.bsky.social/post/3luijutb5ik2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “if you accept [$30] as your base rate of pay and it’s not a favor, you are actively making the material conditions for you and everyone in the field.” When <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valnet purchased Polygon</a>, gutted its staff, and then tried to hire again, many writers publicly shared their refusal to work at the corpse of a once-great site, despite being offered jobs (or, it seems in many cases, contract positions) in tenuous times. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zoehhannah.bsky.social/post/3lslpnl72ak2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Other</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/midimyers.com/post/3lriqqavk2s2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staffers</a> who kept their jobs eventually quit. Networks like Gamurs and Valnet run on writers desperate for games writing jobs, in a field that often chugs along on passion as an alternative to fair wages. A media owner with a games outlet on their hands might look around, see how the field works, and assume <em>that’s just how things work</em>, creating conditions that are, however wrongly and depressingly, industry standard. It’s hard to fault writers who need jobs for taking the jobs available to them in a landscape dominated by such jobs. Many workers have challenged journalism’s dismal status quo through <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/deadspin-entire-staff-quits-1203390454/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collective action</a> or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/08/04/about-one-in-six-u-s-journalists-at-news-outlets-are-part-of-a-union-many-more-would-join-one-if-they-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unionization</a>, but that sort of organizing is logistically and legally challenging–though not <a href="https://freelancesolidarity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impossible</a>–for freelancers. While there’s no denying that people accepting this kind of pay encourages companies to keep offering it, the true blame lies where these jobs and rates originate: at the top.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many instances in this whole saga where individuals could, and maybe even should, have made different decisions. But media owners and what they’ve turned the industry into hold the lion’s share of the responsibility for what is, ultimately, a <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemic</a> failure. They are the ones <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing sites’ focuses</a>, understaffing and underpaying them, and making the kinds of <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tone-deaf branding decisions</a> that set sites like Waypoint up to fail. Waypoint 2.0 might be ending (if this is indeed the end) exactly the way it started, as an example of everything wrong with how business and the wider internet view video games media in 2025: not as a source of news and entertainment, but as an undersupported mill that grinds out cents on the dollar, click by underpaid click.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires"><h3>Call Of The Night Is The Sensual Coming Of Age Anime I Craved As A Teen</h3></a><p>When you’re a teenager, falling in love is about as risky as becoming a vampire</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

That game had been expected to launch in early September. However, No Fate's publisher Reef Entertainment has announced that the game's release is being slightly delayed.</p><p>According to the message shared on Reef's social media accounts, the new release date for Terminator 2D: No Fate is Halloween, October 31, with the team deciding to give Bitmap Bureau "extra time to work on some final refinements for the day one patch," which is why both the physical and the digital versions of the game had to be held back.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1947688265047298504" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025.<br>Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game.

<p>Update: Ubisoft CEO says it's coming to "other machines"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e18eb17f5942/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-23T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 23rd Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has apparently hinted at <strong>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong> for the Switch 2 in the company's latest quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">highlighted by IGN</a>, in a conversation with an investor regarding this title, Guillemot mentioned how there will be "some new versions" of this title "that will come on other machines".</p>
<p>Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet appeared to support this, noting how there will be another game "launched on the Switch 2" (seemingly within the current fiscal year) and this will be "beyond the announced releases" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>).</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 19th Apr, 2025 14:45 BST]</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft was already rumoured to be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">multiple titles to the Switch 2</a>, so what else might we see beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>?</p>
<p>According to a new listing on PEGI's website, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> is on the way to Nintendo's hybrid successor. You can see this on the home page of the site, but when you click through to the rating, there's no mention of a Nintendo version (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d2d49997b76d/assassins-creed-shadows.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life, PEGI</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new entry in Ubisoft's long-running series was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms in March 2025 and received a 'PEGI 18' rating for violence and in-game purchases. Here's the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111337">official description</a> of PEGI's rating:</p>
<h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advice for consumers</strong> This game has received a PEGI 18 which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for persons under 18 years of age. This rating has been given because it features graphic violence, violence against vulnerable and defenceless characters, and motiveless killing of innocent characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Brief outline of the game</strong> Action role-playing game, set in ancient feudal Japan, following two protagonists: Naoe, a young female shinobi, and an African samurai, Yasuke.</p>
<p><strong>Content specific issues</strong> This game contains depictions of graphic violence to human characters. It is possible to decapitate or dismember enemies, using bladed weapons. There are also examples of violence towards vulnerable and defenceless characters. Players may encounter hostage situations, where enemy groups line up bound civilians and execute them. Players are additionally able to kill multiple innocent civilians in towns and cities.</p>
<p><strong>Other issues</strong> This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of cosmetic bundles and a premium in-game currency called Helix Credits, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are depictions of the Japanese form of ritualised suicide, seppuku, in which characters take their own lives using a blade. This occurs in the historical context of a game set in feudal Japan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest development follows Ubisoft confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration">Star Wars Outlaws will be arriving for the Switch 2</a> on 4th September 2025. A new trailer has also been revealed for this game's second "story pack" DLC.</p>

This is because there are all sorts of obstacles that can get in your way and destroy your ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll need to carefully sail around barriers or prepare to ram through them if you have enough ship to do so.

The big draw here is the sheer size of the game's roster, as it looks like just about every character from the show will be present and ready to throw down. Players assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing for special attacks to be chained together. When combined with the new "Rising" gameplay system, these heroes and villains can dish out a significant amount of damage during combat. The game also looks fantastic in action, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-hero-academias-next-game-already-looks-like-a-big-leap-forward-from-ones-justice/1100-6532925/" data-ref-id="1100-6532925">as the reveal trailer</a> showed off slick cel-shaded graphics.</p><p>So far, only a standard edition has been announced for All's Justice, and no preorder bonuses have been confirmed. However, we'll update this post if any additional versions or preorder incentives are announced. Physical PS5 and Xbox Series X copies are available to preorder at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're unfamiliar with My Hero Academia, the series began as a manga written by Kōhei Horikoshi and was then adapted into the now-popular anime series. My Hero Academia takes place in a world where certain people have superpowers, known as "Quirks." This has given rise to a new era of superheroes who protect the people from villains who use their quirks for crime, and the greatest of these public defenders is All Might. The series' protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, dreams of becoming a hero, but was born without a Quirk.

Depending on who you ask, those titular strides came off as either a bold, confident march forward or the haphazard lumbering of a robot that’s still not sure how to walk. But generally, the first wave of reviews describe the latest MCU blockbuster as a stylish and fun summer comic book capper that makes the Fantastic Four cool again, or at least more entertaining than their last three Hollywood outings. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of today, July 22, <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is reviewing better than most recent MCU movies, with an 88 percent on Rotten Tomatoes that puts it in line with <em>Thunderbolts</em>. But where that modern ensemble flick was grey and grimy, <em>Fantastic Four</em> is a hyper-chic spin on the meta-human family channeling the glamor and hopium of Silver Age comics. Starring Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm, and Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, the surrogate family is forced to save a retro-futuristic Earth-828 from Silver Surfer and Galactus, Devourer of Worlds (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-galactus-popcorn-bucket-big-80-price-1851784215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-galactus-popcorn-bucket-big-80-price-1851784215">and wallets</a></span>). </p><p><em>Fantastic Four</em> has the style, but can it break from the MCU’s overly studio tested, increasingly cookie-cutter formula that impedes some of its other films from feeling substantive? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-marvel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-marvel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Bibbiani at <em>The Wrap</em></a></span> thinks it does just enough. “And in capturing the vibe of the Silver Age — if not its actual spirit — Matt Shakman has done something Marvel Studios doesn’t do very well anymore,” he writes. “He’s made a superhero movie that embraces the ‘super’ part. And the ‘hero’ part. And the ‘movie’ part.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1235140218/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1235140218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ehrlich at <em>Indie Wire</em></a></span> was less impressed. “’First Steps’ loses its footing when it launches into space, loses the benefit of its scenery, and forces our attention on the plug-and-play jizz whizz at its core,” he wrote. “The sky’s the limit until the Fantastic Four leave Earth’s atmosphere, at which point they immediately bump into the same low ceiling that makes all of the biggest Marvel movies feel like they have nowhere to grow.”</p><p>Critics seem to at least agree that <em>Fantastic Four </em>is a visual feast and way better than the first three movies Fox made. As someone burnt out on the MCU since <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>, I’ll take clearing the low bar over getting walloped in the face by one higher up. Here’s what other reviewers are saying:</p><h2 id="h343"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1236466922/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1236466922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>What a pleasant surprise then that the opposite proves true in “First Steps,” which centers almost entirely around a threat from Marvel’s biggest villain to date, the planet-sized Galactus. The Fantastic Four are already famous when the film opens, appearing on an Ed Sullivan-style variety show to celebrate four years of protecting the world from all manner of human-scale villains (relatively manageable pests like Mole Man, who resurfaces here in the form of Paul Walter Hauser, or Red Ghost and his Super-Apes, name-checked early on in a nod to the vintage comics). ﻿— Peter Debruge<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h344"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/22/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/22/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> here is much incidental fun to be had in luxuriating in the film’s hallucinatory 60s production design, down to the imaginary movies being shown in cinemas in Times Square: The Emperor’s Twin from Disney and an Alistair MacLean-type adventure called Subzero Intel. Then when the baby is born, Ben Grimm earnestly brandishes his copy of Dr Benjamin Spock’s Baby and Child Care, a permissive book which conservatives were later to blame for raising a generation of undisciplined slackers. Certainly, Kirby’s Sue Storm looks very good for a sleep-deprived new mother with no childcare staff other than one small goggle-eyed robot. As for paterfamilias Reed, he always wears his tie, though sometimes tucks it into his shirt. Overall a very silly movie – though it’s keeping the superhero genre aloft. ﻿— Peter Bradshaw</p></blockquote><h2 id="h345"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Slashfilm</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Fantastic Four” makes space seem large and ineffable. There is a lot of time devoted to them boarding and operating their spacecraft. I appreciate that “First Steps” is set in a gorgeous, sleek universe of miracle technologies, and the filmmakers, through subtle editing and wide camera angles, allow us, the astonished viewers, to sit and take it all in.

Setting it in a half-imagined past avoids all the baggage Marvel movies come with nowadays, here at the ass end of Phase Five or whatever. It likely won’t last. The Fantastic Four, we are assured, will return in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, and there will inevitably be some timeline-shifting that occurs then.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Splitgate 2 launched on June 6 during Summer Game Fest, but the less-than-stellar reception from players since has prompted developer 1047 Games to go back to the drawing board. This means the studio is taking the free-to-play portal-jumping shooter back to beta, which has resulted in a number of layoffs at the studio.</p><p>A lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/">Steam post</a> penned by 1047 founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian states that the negative player feedback has made them realize the game “launched too early” and may have been too ambitious. “We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with,” reads the statement.</p><p>Splitgate 2 will now return to a playable beta form, with 1047 going “heads down” until early 2026 to significantly rebuild the game. This includes, among other changes, reworking the progression systems from scratch, adding more portals to maps, simplifying monetization, and refocusing on classic game modes. During this time, 1047 plans to host more playtests and send more surveys to gather as much community feedback as possible. The studio also promises it will still ship Chapter 3 of the game.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unfortunately, 1047 states that this long-term shift in direction requires reducing an unknown number of studio roles to move development resources towards this rework. The developer promises affected employees will receive severance and job placement support and hopes to “bring them back when we can.”</p><p>To retain as much staff as possible and save costs, 1047 is also shutting down the servers for the original Splitgate in one month; the exact date is unknown. “While we'd love to keep servers online indefinitely, it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team,” reads the statement. 1047 says it's exploring supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches for fans of the first game.</p>

<p>It’s been a rough launch for Splitgate 2. On top of players not enjoying the game nearly as much as the 2019 original, which at one point was so popular on consoles that its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/07/26/splitgate-launch-delayed-to-august-due-to-server-overload">servers routinely crashed</a> due to full player capacities, the game suffered a PR blow stemming from co-founder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">Ian Proulx’s stage appearance</a> during the Summer Game Fest Showcase.</p><p>While promoting Splitgate 2's launch on stage, Proulx wore a hat bearing the message “Make FPS Great Again”, a play on the slogan of the polarizing MAGA movement. Many viewed this reference as tone deaf and insensitive amid the ICE raids occurring in Los Angeles (where SGF takes place) during that time, which ignited several protests in the city. Proulx's appearance garnered significant backlash from some players and industry peers, with many vowing never to play Splitgate 2 as a result. After initially attempting to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/im-not-here-to-apologize-but-i-am-here-to-clarify-splitgate-2-boss-says-his-make-fps-great-again-hat-is-not-a-political-statement/">clarify his actions</a>, Proulx would later issue a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">video apology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we've learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible," reads 1047's Steam update. "Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-returning-to-beta-following-poor-reception-as-developer-1047-games-lays-off]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now coming on <strong>31st October 2025</strong> — as opposed to its original 5th September release date — publisher Reef apologised for the delay and thanked fans "for bearing with us".</p>
<p>The delay affects both the physical and digital version of the game, and will allow "the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself".</p>
<p>"We would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> together", Reef concludes, praising fans hype and support for the pixel art arcade-style game.</p>

<p>We're more than happy to wait; this is one of our most-anticipated games of the year, so while we're champing at the bit to get our hands on it, we're sure the final game will be worth it.</p>
<p>We spent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-like-on-steroids-versus-our-previous-titles-how-terminator-2d-no-fate-changes-the-past-and-future">a good chunk of time chatting to the devs of Terminator 2D</a> about how the game is much, <em>much</em> bigger than anything Bitmap has tackled before, and just how you balance inspiration with faithfulness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> boxed set has been announced. In collaboration with Netflix, Wizards of the Coast is producing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em>, a box packed with adventures taken straight from the world of their hit series, <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast's Managing Game Director, Justice Arman, explained that <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is not unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-borderlands-starter-set-is-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other starter sets</a> available. It contains five pregenerated characters, four prewritten adventures, multiple monster and character tokens, and reference cards for different monsters, spells, and magic items.</p>

The adventures, monsters, and game pieces are all pulled straight from the Netflix series, Stranger Things. Specifically, the material is based on the character Eddie Munson from Season 4, the rock-music-loving head of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> group, the Hellfire Club.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is packed with inside references to the Netflix series. Every piece in the set is drawn in a distinct artstyle invoking the 1980s. The adventures will include creatures from the show like the Demobat and the Demodogs as well as a new creature from the Upside Down. In addition, each adventure is loosely based on <em>Stranger Things'</em> four seasons.</p>

<p>The set even includes a double-sided map of Greyhawkins, a fantasy world created by Munson. The name is a portmanteau of the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting Greyhawk and Hawkins, the small town where <em>Stranger Things</em> is set.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has been a key part of <em>Stranger Things</em> since its debut in 2016. The main cast aren't just avid players, but promote the fantasy TTRPG's core values of communication and teamwork to confront larger-than-life threats. Several of the series' major antagonists even share names with certain <em>D&amp;D</em> baddies, like Demogorgon, Mind Flayers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and Vecna</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> well release on October 7 at an MSRP of $49.99. The set will also be available digitally on D&amp;D Beyond. The release coincides with the premiere of Stranger Things' fifth and final season on November 26.</p>

He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Osbourne, also known as music’s Prince of Darkness, is known for shaping the metal world with his unique vocal and songwriting skills. He truly broke into the music scene as the lead vocalist in Black Sabbath, a pioneering ‘70s group known for projects like 1970’s Paranoid and 1971’s Masters of Reality. Even as the band remained through to the 2000s, Osbourne would go on to release his own solo projects, including 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz and 1991’s No More Tears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate Osbourne’s impact on rock, metal, and music in general, but he’s known for more than his legendary Crazy Train laugh. TV watchers were thrown for a loop in 2002 with The Osbournes, a reality show that featured Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, and Jack Osbourne. It ran for four seasons and 52 episodes before coming to an end in 2005.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning.

He’s lent his voice to South Park and, more recently, Trolls World Tour in the past, and he even made cameo appearances in films like Ghostbusters (2016), Austin Powers in Goldmember, and Little Nicky.

It was meant to serve as a farewell show dedicated to the mark Osbourne left on music as he continued to struggle with Parkinson’s disease and other health complications. All proceeds generated from the concert were donated equally between Cure Parkinson’s, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and Acorn Children’s Hospice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans and fellow musicians from across the globe have already taken to social media to talk about what Osbourne’s music meant to them. Those paying tribute range from Elton John to Metallica as the world gathers to mourn his life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods - a true legend," John said.
