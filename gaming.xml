<p>The claim originally came from SwitchForce over on <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">X</a> (formerly Twitter), but VGC has also heard from multiple sources that a presentation is planned for <strong>12th September</strong>. If that's the case, it'll be taking place the day before the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros</a>.</p>
<p>The 12th <em>is</em> a Friday, which is a bit of an unusual day for a Direct, but Nintendo has previously held presentations on the last working day of the week, with the most-recent being an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>-focused one in 2021. Others have looked at Super Nintendo World (2020), the Wii U, and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-direct-presentation-full-broadcast-history-list">bigger general Direct in 2013</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Plus, besides 2024, Nintendo has held a Direct in September every single year, except last year. So a Direct in September is almost expected. Of course, as always, none of this is confirmed until Nintendo says anything, so remember that healthy pinch of salt!</p>

<p>One of the big reveals of this rumoured Direct will likely be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release date. The game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">was recently rated</a>, meaning it's most likely ready. That and the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are the only big 2025 releases waiting on a date.</p>
<p>So, let's wait and see what happens, then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two minutes past midnight on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">SwitchForce</a>, a leaker who has previously been accurate when making claims on Nintendo events, dropped a tease for a new Nintendo Direct coming next month, specifically, September 12, 2025. Following that tease, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> corroborated SwitchForce's claim by reporting that its sources have stated a Nintendo Direct is coming mid-September, though they did not take a stab at the date.</p>



<p>VGC did, however, point out that there's been a Nintendo Direct in September for nearly as long as Nintendo Directs have been around, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOooMjvltuQbJgWKKYXh3mNz-5KKgkJS8-AvxntJwYVDaiACa8RKC">save for last year</a>, and that if it is on September 12, that would put the Direct one day ahead of the Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary.</p>



<p>While we've had leaks and reports accurately predict dates for these Direct events, what's always been less accurate in that kind of early reporting is the size of the event, regarding whether it'll be a full-blown general Direct, with first and third-party news. Or, if it's just a third-party Partner Showcase, or an Indie World Direct, or a Direct focused entirely on one game.</p>



<p>The most recent Nintendo Direct presentation was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">Kirby Air Riders-dedicated showcase, </a>with Masahiro Sakurai spending 45 minutes detailing everything you'll need to know about the return of the cult-classic racer. Before that, it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, and before that, we had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/">Donkey Kong Bananza-focused Direct</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>



<p>In April, when Nintendo finally revealed the Nintendo Switch 2, was the last time we had a general Nintendo Direct. Hopefully, with three Directs focused on one specific game and a partner showcase between April and now, we're due for a bigger, general Direct that debuts what Nintendo has planned for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>Namely, the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is one announcement that could appear tomorrow. The last we heard, it was due for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/"> late 2025 release</a>. There was also a playable demo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> in Germany and Fan Expo in Canada.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview-for-lovers-of-split-fiction-and-it-takes-two.1279809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t, has never been, and will never die. Local co-op, especially, isn’t going anywhere, and many developers and publishers, thankfully, know what people want. LEGO is about as notable as any leader in the genre, and its new co-op adventure—LEGO Voyagers—seems to get everything right. Walk with me as I explain all in my Gamescom 2025 LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Star Wars</a>: The Video Game was a landmark moment in gaming: Super-popular licenses working hand-in-hand with one another. The ability to relive famous Star Wars moments with another player was the tip of the lightsaber. It spawned annual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> games (sometimes multiple releases a year) and gave friends, couples, and families the chance to enjoy cooperative play.</p>



<p>In LEGO Voyagers, you and a <em>human </em>friend need to learn every trick (and brick) in the book to overcome obstacles, move forward, and rescue a spaceship. I walked away from my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> demo with a big compliment to the game—Hazelight Studios would likely be proud of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-stud-in-its-own-right">A Stud in Its Own Right</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers</a> is a mandatory two-player game with a Friends Pass system, similar to Split Fiction, It Takes Two, and A Way Out. This means you only need to buy one copy of the game, and two players can join forces. There’s no AI or computer-controlled co-op cohort here.</p>



<p>I had the privilege of teaming up with Light Build Studios’ creative director, Karsten Lund, and got to hear his insight into the game as he led me every step of the way. The control scheme is simple enough, as one button lets you jump, and the action button attaches your character to most creations in the environment.</p>



<p>You’ll cling to planks to form a bridge, attach to fallen lights and structures to cross gaps, and even form a literal attachment with your partner as you become a giant poking device you’d only find in Olympic Pole Vault competitions to reach new heights. The handful of platforming sections I conquered won’t have you consulting help manuals or scouring YouTube for walkthroughs, but there’s just enough there to have you thinking. Voyagers could be a great learning tool for young ones.</p>



<p>Lund assured me that some of the game’s later challenges will ramp up the difficulty, though. Making this a co-op game for both young and old to enjoy—more than likely together. You also can’t help but admire how cute the game is. Our muted LEGO bricks are aesthetically endearing and are likely to be a merchandising masterstroke if the game sells—which I think it will.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-steps-into-the-hazelight">LEGO Voyagers Steps Into The Hazelight</h2>



<p>I’m desperate to avoid the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> comparison. The Josef Fares-founded company is seen as a modern-day pioneer of co-op-only gameplay. Creating intertwining adventures where two players must work together to prevail in the face of adversity and swat away negativity in search of the ultimate cathartic conclusion.</p>



<p>LEGO Voyagers gameplay has a similar vibe, and it’s hard to ignore. On the plus side, is this a bad thing? I don’t think so. I adore what Hazelight is doing, and the roughly 30-40 million copies sold across the studio’s first three games are symptomatic of a public that feels the same way.</p>



<p>I love to play co-op games with my fiancé. Always have done. LEGO Voyagers appeals to a wide-ranging demographic and is extremely accessible. From what I played, I don’t think LEGO Voyagers is going to break new ground, but it doesn’t need to, as it’s LEGO, it’s charming, pleasing on the eye, and a lot of fun.</p>



<hr>



<p>Make your way to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to share your thoughts on co-op gaming. Do we need more efforts like we’re seeing from Hazelight and Annapurna/Light Brick Studio? Also, let me know what you thought of my LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>

<p>You can seemingly play Doom on any device with a screen. A modder named Aaron Christophel has managed to get the 1993 classic running on a portable Anker Prime charging station.</p>



<p>The charging station features a Synwit SWM34S SoC(system on a chip) with 8MB SDRam and 16MB of external flash memory. These specs allow Doom to be played on the built-in 200×480 LCD screen.</p>



<p>The controls are also pretty straight forward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOU8SqCqeY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for what Christophel</a> had to work with. You can move forward and backward by turning the dial; pushing the dial in and turning rotates you left and right; pushing the dial in without turning allows you to fire and open doors.</p>



<p>Christophel says that it was done without making any modifications to the internal hardware of the device. He was able to get it running using the debugging header connected to another device. </p>



<p>It may not be the most convenient way to play Doom, but the fact that you can is impressive in and of itself. Who knows, maybe this will also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">become an Xbox</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is introducing a new, higher level cap and rebalancing the XP requirements for existing levels — though no player will see their current level reduced. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's current level 50 cap, introduced back in 2020, will rise to level 80, giving players a significant new milestone to aim towards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the game's levelling curve should be smoother, developers told IGN in a pre-announcement briefing, meaning XP levels overall should be hit more frequently. This will be achieved by a rebalance of all XP levels to date, and the removal of additional, time-consuming levelling tasks between levels 41 to 50.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, players who have already earned the necessary XP will be boosted up to the new level system's requirements when they go live on October 18 — though the exact XP amounts required post-rebalance are yet to be confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cruically, Pokémon levels, which are currently tied to your player level, will not be expanded or rebalanced, with level 50 remaining the cap there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't expect hitting the new level 80 player cap to be easy, however. Alongside the necessary XP requirements, a fresh set of levelling tasks will be added for the final climb from level 71 to 80, ensuring only the toughest Trainers hit the game's new top level (and there's still plenty to grind for).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New rewards for levelling up will include fresh avatar items, plus increased storage capacity for Pokémon, items and gifts — upgrades you would otherwise pay for. (And if you're already at the game's maximum limit for one of these, developers confirmed you'll still be boosted above that.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's even a new boost for friends at level 70 and above, who will have an increaed chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/25/unnamed-1756128853121.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's current level 50 cap has stood since 2020. What do you mean you're not there yet?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those keen to preserve their legacy of levelling up prior to the October 15 update, existing avatar items will be retired and made exclusive to those who already earned them (for example, the Level 50 Jacket item). A pair of new profile medals will also be available, if you reached up to Level 49 prior to the new cap being introduced, and another if you made Level 50.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help players on their way to the new milestone, XP will be boosted in-game from today until October 14 with double XP for catching, and an additional 3,000 XP for winning raids and Max Battles.  Timed Research will offer further rewards, with a tasty 7 million XP on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a busy time for Pokémon Go, which is also now teasing its next in-game season. A video released yesterday included confirmation that Meta Metagross would debut in the coming months, alongside the long-awaited return of Keldeo — a Mythical creature only made available once via a premium purchase for a brief time back in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When it was first revealed earlier this year, we said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-from-the-developer-of-warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-looks-a-lot-like-a-new-mass-effect-and-yes-there-is-romance">“looks a lot like a new Mass Effect.”</a> Now, after having watched almost an hour of it in action at gamescom 2025, developer Owlcat Games has done nothing to change my mind. That is, of course, a very welcome thing – it’s been eight years since the last Mass Effect (13 since the last <em>good</em> one), and the upcoming, undated sequel is both far away and has a lot to prove following BioWare’s recent chain of underwhelming releases. Owlcat stepping up with its own 3D, space-faring adventure is something of a relief, then – finally, after so many years of waiting, we’re getting a “new” Mass Effect from a studio that’s really proven its RPG talents with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Pathfinder</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>. But while Osiris Reborn is certainly comfortingly familiar, the hard sci-fi nature of The Expanse is new territory for this format, as opposed to BioWare’s Star Wars and Trek influences. That allows it to neatly circumnavigate any “we have Mass Effect at home” jokes, but does run the risk of being a colder cousin to Commander Shepard’s so easily likable odyssey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Osiris Reborn takes place in parallel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-expanse">The Expanse</a>’s core story – the first two books, if you're a reader, and the early TV seasons if you're a watcher. You’ll feel the impact of important events ripple through your adventure; the mission I watched creative director Alexander Mishulin play took place in the wake of the Eros Incident, and several minutes in the news of the Canterbury being attacked was spreading among a panicked space station. If all that means nothing to you, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about – I’m only a casual fan of The Expanse myself, with a fading memory of those early episodes, and everything seemed to slot into place. I imagine Owlcat is making efforts for this original story to be a gateway into the universe.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While familiar faces will eventually turn up, Osiris Reborn charts the journey of a player-created protagonist and a team of original characters. Among your crew of Pinkwater Security mercenaries is J, our companion for this demo mission as well as your sibling (they’re modelled after your custom character to ensure family resemblance, a nice touch that means everyone will get their own version of them.) Owlcat aims to make every companion feel present and alive, and as we explore the mercenary station J wanders off to chat with NPCs, providing the sense that he’s his own person and not just a pawn to direct in battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we push on and gossip with a vendor and a technician, I find that the writing doesn’t hit the highs of either Mass Effect or Owlcat’s own isometric RPGs. It’s somewhat flat and lacking in character-defining flourishes, and as a result I’m not yet convinced these companions will be as charming or engaging as those in the series Osiris Rising is so clearly built upon. But don’t take that as me writing them off – The Expanse has some excellent, complex characters that reward a slow burn, and so there’s every chance your crew will get where they need to be over the course of the 30-ish hour campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The siblings previously escaped the disastrous Eros Incident by stealing a spaceship from the shadowy Protogen corporation, and the repercussions of that are where the demo kicks into action: Protogen has followed us back home to demand justice. It’s here we’re presented with a classic RPG choice: we can ask our Pinkwater Security colleagues to resist and cover our escape, or simply try to slip away unaided. One persuasion check later, the station’s senior officer has agreed to have his mercenaries hold the line while we make our exit. Mishulin promises there will be repercussions for this, both immediate and delayed. As we crawl through the station’s vents, the roar of battle echoes as our allies hold the line against Protogen. Later, we see the cost of that choice: dead bodies strewn through the corridors. After unlocking the station’s armoury in search of new equipment, we find it completely stripped of guns – every rifle taken in an attempt to secure our safety. These are perhaps somewhat surface-level consequences, and I suspect the alternative route wouldn’t have been significantly different (Protogen later announced that they would have dealt with us reasonably peacefully, so certainly there’d be fewer bodies.) The real question is how our choices ripple across the campaign. Perhaps by resisting and losing so many mercenaries, we’ve set ourselves up for more significant failure later on down the road.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Expanse’s hard sci-fi nature means there’s not really the opportunity for space wizards or aliens with bizarre abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the station’s staff were doing plenty to fight off Protogen, there were multiple opportunities for us to deal out our own punishment. Like Mass Effect, combat is a core part of The Expanse, and is similarly a cover-based shooting affair augmented by abilities. The rocket grenades are perhaps the most fun – thrown explosives with their own guidance thrusters that zoom across the arena like fireworks. There’s a lore reason for such extravagant properties: thrown explosives don't tend to go where you want when there’s little-to-no gravity, and half the battle sequences shown in the demo were in such spaces. Anchored to the side of the station by mag-lock boots, these fights didn’t seem significantly different to those waged inside, despite a bespoke system that adjusts the way movement feels and handles, but were made striking by the way bodies and debris float across the arena. Destructible environments splinter and shatter under heavy gunfire, which does occasionally eliminate the enemy’s cover, but mostly seems there to score cool points rather than be a significant tactical advantage. And it really does look cool, especially when explosions tear entire wall panels apart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My main concern when it comes to combat is the threat that there will be few options beyond guns. The Expanse’s hard sci-fi nature means there’s not really the opportunity for space wizards or aliens with bizarre abilities, and so it may be that the entire combat experience is delivered via the muzzle of a gun. Mishulin assures me there’s a wide variety of firearms that provide a range of experiences even within weapon classifications (there are three assault rifles and all of them have significantly different properties, he explains), plus the distinction between a sniper-focused marksman and the more typical run-and-gun class. But that’s all very Call of Duty, and my hope is that Owlcat has a smart, more RPG-style approach beyond that. With any luck, there will be technical characters such as hackers that provide a more specialised, ability-driven approach.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t say I’ve instantly fallen in love with any one single part of Osiris Reborn, and I’ll need to see at least a few more hours to know if I’ll truly connect with its characters – arguably the most important part of an RPG. But what I have seen appears to be exactly the kind of foundations I’ve been looking for since I took Shepard on their final mission. It’s combat-forward, but conversation-heavy. It’s about the team, but with none of the micromanagement of more traditional computer RPGs. And The Expanse itself is a promising ore vein to be mined – it may be a colder, more grounded universe that puts hard restrictions on several RPG staples, but it’s also a world rife with complex politics that hopefully will lead to conflicts that are deeper and more nuanced than the typical bleeding heart leftie vs tyrannical fascist scenarios so common in this genre.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t exactly the first time Owlcat has “done a BioWare.” As the demo came to a close, Mishulin compared the studio’s Pathfinder games to Baldur’s Gate 2. This project sees the developer take inspiration from a later era of BioWare – and so Owlcat must also tread the same path as its muse, shifting from isometric to cinematic. But it knows it can’t just follow in those exact footsteps. “We are building on that legacy and expanding what players anticipate from this experience,” said game design producer Yuliya Chernenko when The Expanse: Osiris Reborn was announced. I wouldn’t say I saw much evidence of that expansion in this demo, but I hope that it exists and will be revealed in time. But even if it falls short of those ambitions and is simply a hard sci-fi version of Mass Effect, I think I’d still happily settle for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-our-best-hope-for-a-new-bioware-style-rpg]]></content:encoded>

Everything listed in this paragraph, <em>except for the Clint Eastwood jam track,</em> is included in one big ole bundle, but you'll also be able to buy everything individually if you only want one or two things.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gorillaz music pass</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555028-fest_10_gorillaz_musicpass_outfit_russel_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555028" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555028-fest_10_gorillaz_musicpass_outfit_russel_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555028"></a><figcaption>The Russel skin unlocks instantly when you purchase the Gorillaz music pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555028-fest_10_gorillaz_musicpass_outfit_russel_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>The rest of the Gorillaz cosmetics can be found on the new music pass, which costs 1400 V-Bucks and is included with a Fortnite Crew subscription. Buying the pass immediately unlocks the Russel skin, and progressing through the pass by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode will unlock a series of other cosmetics--with the Murdoc skin coming at the end. Along the way you can also unlock back blings, instruments--Russel's drums and Murdoc's bass--and four licensed jam tracks:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>On Melancholy Hill</strong> by Gorillaz</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Interstate Love Song</strong> by Stone Temple Pilots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Run It Up</strong> by Hanumankind</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Montagem Tomada</strong> by MXZI</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Free stuff!</h2><p dir="ltr">As is Fortnite tradition, there's a decent bounty of free stuff on the new music pass as well, like a keytar, an additional drum kit, an aura, and four new Epic-produced jam tracks, including the full version of the song from <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=3918" rel="nofollow ">this emote</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Festival updates</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555029-fest_10_gorillaz_newstagereveal_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555029-fest_10_gorillaz_newstagereveal_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555029"></a><figcaption>The new Gorillaz-themed Festival Main Stage.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555029-fest_10_gorillaz_newstagereveal_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Epic rarely makes major changes to the Festival mode during each season, and so for fans of the rhythm game, the beginning of a new season is an exciting time because this is when we get quality-of-life improvements. For Season 10, we've got several small but fundamental changes that address some specific complaints.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">They redesigned the look of lift notes in hopes that it will make them easier to read for folks who struggle with them. This change can be toggled in settings if you don't like the new look.</li><li dir="ltr">They added a "Good" popup for when you miss the center of the note to go along with the existing "Perfect" popup, to make it easier to track those in your peripheral vision.</li><li dir="ltr">You can sort by length and difficulty when browsing songs on the Main Stage.</li><li dir="ltr">Folks with guitar controllers and other non-gamepad devices can now strum when they calibrate using the in-game "tuneup" tool.</li></ul><p>The Festival Main Stage got a makeover, too, as you can see above.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A tease for next season</h2><p dir="ltr">In a surprising move, Epic's announcement for Season 10 also included a tease for what comes next, which it described as a "celebration" of Festival with "Fortnite-original rewards and awesome music." That could very well mean it won't have a headlining artist like Gorillaz or Bruno Mars, and Epic wants to mentally prime us for that in advance.</p>

                <p><em>Until Dawn is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, August 25, 2025. Below, we explore the fascinating legacy and origin of a classic horror game.</em></p><p>Video games are an incredible medium for horror stories. Some of the greatest games of all time are firmly planted in the horror genre. While games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill showed audiences the importance of tension in gameplay, the advancement in gaming technology allowed for more cinematic experiences in gameplay design and storytelling.</p><p>In 2015, one of the best examples of horror storytelling in gaming was released and left a lasting legacy that can be felt to this very day. That game was Until Dawn.</p><p>Developed by British developer Supermassive Games, Until Dawn actually started life as a game for Sony's scarcely supported PlayStation 3 peripheral: the Playstation Move. Supermassive sought to create the experience of living through a slasher film and designed the game to appeal to couples in their early 20's, promising a game that would deliver the blood, guts, and scares that come with slasher films.</p><p>This early version of the game had players controlling on-screen flashlights from a first-person perspective, guiding their characters through dark environments and interacting with objects with the motion controls to progress the game. The version of the game did not make it out of alpha testing, and Supermassive went back to the drawing board.</p><p>When Until Dawn finally reemerged, it was a title for the newly released PlayStation 4. Gone were the first-person perspective and motion controls. They were replaced by fixed, cinematic camera angles and more interactive gameplay design, akin to the works of Quantic Dream like Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. Supermassive also made the transition to the Decima engine, a proprietary PlayStation engine that would eventually power games such as Horizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding, that would help provide photorealistic graphics. Until Dawn went from being a title that potentially would not have found an audience due to requiring a motion peripheral to a game that would provide a more loving tribute to horror films that could be played using just the controller.</p><p>With this change in direction, the game was entirely recast with actors whose likenesses were used in the game, including Academy Award winner Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere (Scream 4 and 6), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, John Wick: Chapter 2), among many others. Supermassive tapped writers Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick, known for their work in horror films, to pen the script, providing an even deeper layer of authenticity to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554694" data-ratio="0.56279988710133" data-width="3543" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554694"></a><figcaption>Until Dawn (2015)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg"></figure><p>Until Dawn's story starts off as a treasure trove of slasher tropes and eventually evolves into something far more sinister and supernatural. Characters begin as one-note cliches and archetypes and eventually blossom into fleshed-out people with meaningful relationships. Thanks to that strong writing, it's devastating when one accidentally dies due to a bad decision by the player. While most horror games of the era emphasized action, Until Dawn provided players with a sense of dread and a fear of the unknown unlike anything else at the time.</p><p>Until Dawn ended up being more of a movie-like experience that let player's' decisions affect the ultimate outcome of the story. The game featured a "butterfly effect" mechanic that showed players the exact moment one of their decisions or a character's death affected the story and helped incentivize repeat playthroughs to see the other possible narrative paths. Until Dawn also held onto some of its roots as a PlayStation Move title, DualShock 4 controller's motion control capabilities, and even included a "Don't Move" mechanic that asked players to hold their controllers as still as possible to determine certain outcomes and fates.</p><p>Until Dawn was a massive success both critically and commercially. It helped turn Supermassive into a reliable source for interactive horror experiences and the studio went on to make more cinematic games, such as The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry, but none of these titles ever quite reached the high bar set by Until Dawn.</p><p>Supermassive revisited the Until Dawn universe with the virtual reality games Until Dawn: Rush of Blood and The Inpatient, the latter of which was set around 60 years before the original game and brought back Fesseden and Reznick as writers.</p><p>Until Dawn would receive the full remake treatment in 2024 when Sony announced a version for the PS5. The remake, developed by Ballistic Moon (which was founded by former Supermassive employees), features a new third-person camera angle, a new musical score, and extended prologues and new endings. One of those endings is open-natured retconning the original's conclusions, implying that a direct sequel to Until Dawn could one day be possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554695"></a><figcaption>Until Dawn's remake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg"></figure><p>But the remake was not received well. It featured a myriad of performance issues, minimal improvements over the PS4 original, and felt unnecessary overall, when the original still holds up to this day.</p><p>Until Dawn's legacy would come full circle in 2025, when Sony released a film adaptation of the game. There was speculation when the film was announced about how exactly the movie would adapt the game, since a prime part of Until Dawn's storytelling was the possibility for narrative branching based on the player's decisions and their success or failure in gameplay at key moments. Would the film adapt a "canon" version of the game's story? Would it reuse the same actors? Would it be a secret project connecting to the recently released remake?</p><p>The answer, it turned out, was none of the above. Instead, the movie Until Dawn tells a wholly original story that pays tribute to video games in numerous respects. The film tells the story of Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends travelling to a mysterious cabin in search of her missing sister. While there, they encounter numerous threats, and every time the characters are killed, the day resets, trapping them in a time loop.</p><p>Facing a new threat every night, the group realizes the only way to break the loop is to survive until dawn. While the film features some tributes to the original game (and even features Stormare reprising his role), it ultimately ends up a mishmash of ideas and cliches that fail to capture the experience of the game.</p><p>That is perhaps what's most fascinating about the legacy of Until Dawn: It's a video game inspired by horror films that spawned a horror film inspired by video games. What started off as a PlayStation Move game took on a whole new life and cemented its legacy not only in video games but the horror genre in general.</p><p>While numerous attempts have been made to recapture the magic of the original game, none have reached the high levels of sincerity, rich storytelling, and gameplay that Until Dawn delivered. A decade later, Until Dawn remains one of the definitive horror gaming experiences.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic has announced some big changes to the mobile game, as starting in October, progression is being completely overhauled. Not only is the level cap being raised substantially from 50 to 80, but players can also expect several other changes geared toward making progression feel more meaningful with new rewards and cosmetics.</p><p>The update will go live on October 15, and existing players will have their levels determined based on their total earned XP to date. <a href="http://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niantic says</a> no player will go down a level and there'll also be a limited-time update with XP bonuses and a Timed Research event. Here's a breakdown of all the changes:</p><ul><li>Level cap increases from 50 to 80</li><li>Tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 to 50 will be removed</li><li>New Level-Up Research tasks will be added to levels 71 to 80</li><li>Players at level 70 and higher will have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players</li><li>New rewards will be added to level-up progression, like increased storage capacity for Pokemon, items, and gifts.</li><li>New avatar items can be earned starting at level 25</li></ul><p>Players who experience a jump up in level will receive rewards associated with reaching those levels at that time, and Niantic will share details on these at a later date. Before the update goes live, players can also earn new cosmetics by reaching levels 40 through 50. The items include a Level 50 Jacket and an all-new avatar pose, and these will not be available once the leveling overhaul is implemented. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555893"></a><figcaption>You only have until October 14 to get these Pokemon Go prizes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg"></figure><p>From now until October 14, several bonuses will be available to help players level up more quickly in Pokemon Go. These include:</p><ul><li>2 × Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws</li><li>+3,000 XP from winning raids</li><li>+3,000 XP from winning Max Battles</li></ul><p>Time Research quests that can net up to 7 million additional XP. Additionally, an existing level 47 Level-Up Research task will be changed so it's easier to complete; rather than exploring 25km eight times in a week, the task only asks you to do so twice.</p><p>In case you missed it, the final month of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-events-raid-bosses-spotlight-hours-community-day/1100-6533384/">Pokemon Go's Delightful Days season is almost over</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo hosting a Nintendo Direct in September would not be surprising at all given Nintendo historically hosts Direct events in September. Regarding the potential September 12 date, that timing is conspicuous given it is one day before the 40th anniversary of the release of 1985's original Super Mario Bros.</p><p>As for what Nintendo may have to show or discuss at a potential Nintendo Direct in September, people are speculating that the company may finally reveal the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-is-still-scheduled-to-launch-within-the-next-150-days/1100-6533663/" data-ref-id="1100-6533663">confirmed for release in 2025</a> but doesn't have a specific date on the calendar yet.</p><p>It is one of the Switch 2's big games coming in 2025, alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> on October 15. Many have been expecting Nintendo to share more information about the inevitable next 3D Mario game, but as of yet, there is nothing to suggest an announcement will come in September.</p><p>A Nintendo Direct in September could help Nintendo set the stage for the all-important holiday shopping season and help give people further reason to buy a Switch 2. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">Switch 2 got off to a hot start upon launch in June</a>, experts said early sales were always going to be strong due to pent-up demand and how the enthusiast crowd is not as price-sensitive. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-was-not-an-issue-at-launch-but-next-test-is-this-holiday-analyst-says/1100-6533403/" data-ref-id="1100-6533403">"next test" for the Switch 2</a>, some have said, will be how the console performs during the holidays with the mass-market consumer.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on August 19 and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/" data-ref-id="2900-6889">beefy broadcast focused exclusively on Kirby: Air Riders.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">Microsoft and Sony have raised console prices this year</a> due in part to US President Donald Trump's tariffs, but Nintendo is keeping the Switch 2 at $450 or $500 for the Mario Kart World bundle. However, one industry expert said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">Nintendo could raise the price of the Switch 2 in 2026.</a> Nintendo itself, meanwhile, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">cannot rule out a price hike for the Switch 2.</a></p><p>Nintendo has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and some Switch 2 accessories</a> due to market factors.</p>

<p>Other than the Switch 2 reveal trailer and a follow-up at the Partner Showcase in July, we know little else about the game, so hopefully we'll get some news next month.</p>
<p>Nintendo doesn't usually attend the Tokyo-based showcase, so this might be the only Nintendo-published game at the event. We'll see!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon Go Level Cap to Increase to 80 in October]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-level-cap-80-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-go-level-cap-to-increase-to-80-in-october.1279752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic and The Pokemon Company have announced that later this year, the level cap for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>will be increased, which the developer says will lead to a "more fun and engaging" leveling experience.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Niantic says that on October 15th, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>level cap will increase from 50 to 80, which, according to Niantic, will lead to players "celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more".</p>

<p>According to Niantic, the new level cap means that some players "can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP", but that nobody's level will decrease. As such, when the update arrives, if you suddenly find yourself at a higher level, that's why.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=eXrT9rau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=GX_FWCQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go</em>'s level cap will be increasing in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is the level cap itself increasing, but leveling between 1 and 80 will be rebalanced, according to Niantic. Naturally, Level-Up Research tasks for levels 41 through 50 will be replaced with tasks from levels 71 through 80.</p>

<p>You can also expect other goodies like a boosted chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players when you hit level 70, as well as new rewards for progression, including increased storage capacity and new avatar items.</p>

<p>By the time October 14th (the day before the update is set to hit) arrives, you'll get a "special medal" commemorating the highest level you've achieved in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, and if you hit 50, you'll get a special jacket and avatar pose.</p>

<p>Between now and October 15th, you'll get double catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws, and you'll get an extra 3,000 XP for winning raids and Max Battles. Timed Research will also become available to those level 7 or over, giving you the chance to "earn over 7 million XP", Niantic says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-bonuses.jpg?itok=piSccBxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-bonuses.jpg?itok=AjXSrQJ5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>between now and October 15th, you'll get bonuses galore.</figcaption></figure><p>News of the level cap follows the announcement of a new season in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, with various new 'mons set to debut from September 2nd, including Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and more.</p>

<p>All of this follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games" rel="nofollow">sale of Niantic to the Saudi-backed firm Scopely</a> back in February, a move that Scopely was quick to reassure fans would not affect the day-to-day operations of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em><em>.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-switch-2-mario-metroid-prime-4-date-2000619997</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-switch-2-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-soon-and-will-probably-be-a-big-one.1279749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">has been out in the wild for several months now</a>, but we still know very little about what Nintendo has planned for its future. Could that be about to change? The next Nintendo Direct is reportedly planned for mid-September and seems poised to offer way more than just a deep dive into the company’s holiday lineup.</p> <p>While there’s a big Nintendo Direct almost every September, the company’s post-Switch 2 launch marketing has been all over the place. <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">A new rumor from SwitchForce</a>, however, claims a Nintendo Direct is planned for September 12. That’s a Friday, which would be a bizarre time for a Nintendo showcase. Perhaps that’s the Japan date, which would put the showcase during the late afternoon on Thursday, a much more believable time for a livestream. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/"><em>VGC</em> corroborated the broader claim</a> that Nintendo is holding a mid-September Direct, but was unable to specify the date. It’s possible Nintendo’s plans could still change.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> for the NES arrived on September 13, 1985, making next month the franchise’s 40th anniversary. That would make a Nintendo Direct the perfect time to announce a new Mario-themed Switch 2, Switch Online multiplayer spin-off, the return of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Star</em>s, or something more. I’m hoping for an HD remake of <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>Where is the Switch 2’s new 3D <em>Mario</em>?</h2> <p>Fans are also still waiting on a release date for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which Nintendo continues to affirm will come out in 2025. With <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> coming in October and <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> in Novembe</a>r, December is looking like the only option at this point, unless the company can sneak out its new sci-fi shooter earlier than expected. There are still some Switch 1 games ripe for Switch 2 updates like <em><a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1959813021230149807">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>.</p> <p>As for what lies beyond this year, there are already some previously announced exclusives, like<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753"><em> The Duskbloods</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon Raiders,</em></a> waiting in the wings. But Nintendo has yet to tease new arrivals in some of its biggest franchises, like <em>Animal Crossing</em>,<em> Super Smash Bros.,</em> and<em> The Legend of Zelda</em>. And then there’s Mario. Reports that the <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> team is a splinter group from the original <em>Mario Odyssey</em> team suggest the plumber’s next big platforming adventure could be just around the corner. Would Nintendo really let the Switch 2 go its whole inaugural year without a new <em>Mario</em> game?</p> <p>The company has seemingly spent the last few years of the Switch 1’s lifecycle saving up big releases for its new hardware. Maybe it’ll finally pull back the curtain on what some of them are next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158188/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes the lines between remaster and remake can be blurred. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> seems much more like a full remake, and a few games called remakes don’t quite live up to expectations. For <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> - based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar</a> - even the term remake doesn’t quite seem to do it justice. This feels more like a fresh new entry in the <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> franchise that picks up the best elements of the DS title to deliver a spectacular farming sim that gleefully digs its own path.</p>
<p>Grand Bazaar casts you as a fledgling farmer in Zephyr Town, a gorgeous little place with a friendly cast of characters waiting to become your friends, or if you play your cards right, your spouse. While you may be familiar with the regular farming mechanics in this series, Grand Bazaar’s titular mechanic - the bazaar - adds an engaging twist to proceedings that kept me up for hours.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158183/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every Saturday you take your best produce or crafted items to the bazaar and peddle off as much as you can, granting you the ability to earn a little more cash than the regular way of selling, but also the chance to level up your bazaar. Doing so brings other vendors to Zephyr Town along with more options as new shopkeepers allow you to spend your hard-earned money on new gameplay elements, expansions for your barn, farm, or pockets, and other neat additions.</p>
<p>Much like the addictive push and pull of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>’s shop mechanics, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar effectively balances its addictive farming gameplay with the bazaar-building side of things to keep you hooked. Ringing your little bell draws customers over, and occasionally they will flash up with an item they want; if you quickly place the requested item on your stall, they'll rush over. Plus, you can use the new Nature Sprites (more on those later) to cheer for you, which unlocks helpful bonuses and put a big stupid grin on my face every time I set off this fanfare.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158185/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Actually navigating your bazaar is a touch annoying, as you use full 3D movement to approach your stalls. I would have preferred to just press left and right to move, which would make the process much quicker. But, for me at least, the addictive loop of farming and selling at the bazaar meant often I played the game until I fell asleep holding my Switch 2 in bed. While I’ve never played the DS original, I have played other <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> / <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> games, and with the upgrades on Switch 2, Grand Bazaar might nestle into the very best of the series.</p>
<p>Now onto the other side of things, the farming. Much of this is what you expect, especially if you’re a genre aficionado. Grab some seeds, use a hoe to till some soil, scatter the aforementioned seeds, then keep them watered and fertilised to see the fruits of your labour. You eventually get a barn and get to look after some animals, and keeping them fed and happy rewards you with produce like eggs, milk, and even wool.</p>
<p>One thing that gets my goat with farming games is when the farming feels like busy work, and occasionally Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar nudges that feeling. Thankfully, better farming tools are steadily introduced which improve your ability to till crops and slowly allow you to make more crops and earn more cash. However, you'll also have to contend with your stamina, much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158182/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, managing stamina is particularly painful. Smashing rocks or watering multiple tiles of soil sees your stamina plummet, and while you can eat food or take a bath to replenish this, you essentially have the energy of an 80-year-old after a marathon. Importantly, you can find ways to permanently increase your stamina, but for the first 40-50 hours of the game at least, these opportunities are very sparse.</p>
<p>One of the key changes in Grand Bazaar is the movement. You can double jump, just like the original, but you now also have a glider, which you can use to take advantage of the wind to sail across Zephyr Town easy-breezy. Between the ability to farm multiple tiles at once, the immensely satisfying platforming, and the small but richly-packed Zephyr Town, it's so fun to scurry around and do your chores. You can even hop across rooftops and, on very windy days, you can use the extra height to glide to hidden areas and smash some rare rocks or find other foragable items. Just watch out for hurricanes, where you’ll have to use the new windscreens to keep the blustery menace from ruining your crops.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158186/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new mechanic comes in the form of those aforementioned Nature Sprites, adorable little creatures dotted around the map. Hand them your foragables like fish, mushrooms, and more, and they will increase the overall quality of these. However, the vast variety of items and different possible qualities means your inventory fills up much quicker than you’d like. Make sure to invest in storage or pocket space immediately. Thankfully you can quickly place boxes around town and in the many windmills - where you can craft better and more complicated delights - so you don’t have to lug everything around.</p>
<p>Fishing, unfortunately, is easily the weakest part of the game, which is a shame as I normally love catching fish. The actual gameplay is fine — you press certain buttons to reel in your fish — but it is painfully slow, especially with bigger fish. Compared to catching bugs, which you pick up immediately, or the fact you can just instantly smash rocks, I rarely wanted to spend my precious moments reeling in fish, so this part of the game stayed largely forgotten for me.</p>
<p>However, one part I really love is cooking. You earn recipes by eating food from the local restaurant, unlocking the item once you’ve gulped it down for the first time. Cook with your crops and animal produce to make dishes that not only top up your stamina, but also grant buffs like increased running speed or temporary stamina increases. It’s all instant, and you can make multiple of the same recipe at once provided you have the materials. I’ve been eagerly anticipating the occasional Cook-Offs, one of the many seasonal events that give you a chance to show off your wares, or earn some trophies for your house.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158179/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a lot of smart choices in Grand Bazaar which help to make the most of your time and keep you engaged. A request system helps you unlock new bazaar vendors, and these often test your abilities. You can ring a bell to say hello to folks as you run around, allowing you to build friendship points easily. And when it comes to bazaar time, you can choose different pieces of decor to help keep food fresh or sell more items in bulk.</p>
<p>Marvelous has really taken a lot of time to perfect the gameplay loop of Grand Bazaar, and that polish has also spilled out into the characters and the visuals. When greeting your townsfolk, you’ll now be met with fully voice-acted dialogue, adding charm and personality to every interaction. The voiceover work here is lovely, and makes it <em>much</em> harder to choose who you want to marry. You aren’t restricted by gender option either, so there’s plenty of bachelors or bachelorettes to pick from, and that’s before mentioning some of the new characters added to this remake. If you must know, I’m hoping to settle down with June if I can impress her with enough tea.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158181/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Harvest Moon series is well known for its adorable chibi style, here everyone has been given more human-like proportions. It works with the gorgeous visuals to make Zephyr Town feel a touch more realistic and homely. The visuals on Switch 2 are crisp and colourful, with a rock-solid frame rate. Trees blow with the wind and the water ripples with a gorgeous detail. It might not be the most demanding game on the Switch 2, but it might be the best-looking Story of Seasons entry, even if the occasional texture can look very pixelated up close.</p>
<p>After about 50 hours with the game, I do have a few other small nitpicks. While it’s nice to be able to organise your items by quality or freshness, it’s annoying you can’t quickly sort by sale price. One other niggle is the implementation of HD Rumble. I might be spoiled by the clip-clop of the horse in Stardew Valley, but here it’s just a flat ‘BZZZTT’ whenever you hit anything. It’s annoyingly sharp and loud, especially in handheld.</p>
<p>Overall, though, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish. I’ve had a blast doting over my farm animals, training up my dog so he can better corral my flocks, and spending time getting ready for the bazaar. Then, when Saturday hits, I open up my shop and enjoy the flurry of purchases, before spending my money on some much-needed new abilities, changes to the town, or some of the many customisation features. Even if they do demand quite a lot of wool and dye from you.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re in the mood for an engaging, endearing, and cute farming game, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar should tickle your pickle with aplomb. It might not have the depth of other farming sims, but it's fantastic to control, and the well-written (and voiced) characters alongside the many tasks and calendar packed with events to occupy your time, make you feel like part of a bustling little community.</p>
<p>I fell in love with Zephyr Town, and thanks to the satisfying gameplay and intricately connected web of rewards, I can't see myself putting it down any time soon.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Turok: Origins, a sort of reboot of the classic sci-fi shooter franchise. </p>



<p>As some old-school gamers may already know, Turok was originally a comic book character who appeared as a master Native American tracker, survivalist, and hunter in late 1954 in comics published by Dell Comics. Later, he would also appear in comics published by Valiant Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Dynamite Comics, but his fame mainly came from the successful video game series created by Acclaim in 1997. Five years later, just before the launch of Turok: Evolution, Acclaim could boast that the franchise had already generated over $250 million in sales revenue.</p>



<p>However, the IP's luck didn't last much longer. Following the release of Evolution, there was only one more installment, the 2008 game developed by a studio called Propaganda Games. While not well-received by critics, the game sold more than one million copies in its first two months on the market, prompting the Vancouver-based studio to start working on a sequel. Propaganda was owned by Disney Interactive Studios, though, which decided to shut down the studio (and the new Turok title) in 2011 after Tron: Evolution also disappointed.</p>



<p>Around seventeen years later, Saber Interactive is hoping to reignite the interest of long-time fans in the series. They are, after all, quite experienced in the feat following the successful revival of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, not to mention the upcoming Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake.</p>



<p>During a Gamescom 2025 presentation, we learned that most of Saber Madrid, a studio composed of around 250 employees, has been working on Turok: Origins for nearly five years now. The game will feature a story campaign of around fifteen hours, and the narrative will somehow connect to that first game installment from 1997.</p>



<p>The story sees the legendary warriors dealing not only with the usual dinosaurs but also with an alien threat, the so-called Xenia civilization, that seeks to eradicate all human life from the galaxy. The Turok and humankind as a whole are losing the war, so they embark on an interplanetary quest to find a superpower capable of turning the tide of the conflict. Yes, that means there will be various planets to visit in the final game; Ancient temples, wasteland canyons, and dense jungles are just a few examples of the places you'll find in Turok: Origins. </p>



<p>Following the brief presentation, we tried a demo of the game itself. The game supports three-player online cooperative action, so it's no wonder that there are three playable characters with their own weapons and perks and Ultimate abilities. During game sessions, players can also extract Echoes from fallen foes and the environment to unlock powers in real-time.</p>



<p>Other than that, Turok: Origins plays like pretty standard shooter fare. The maps are fairly linear and don't allow that much exploration, so you'll just be mowing down enemies while heading toward the next control point. When you have injured a foe enough, you can swoop into melee range to trigger a cool-looking execution move. The demo required using the grappling hook occasionally, but it was only available at predefined points, rather than giving players free rein on where to go.</p>



<p>One thing that long-time franchise fans will be happy to learn is that the developers have added the option to switch in real-time (by long-pressing the d-pad) between first and third-person view. The game had been announced as a third-person title, but Turok games have always been played in first-person view, and now you have that option available.</p>



<p>The highlight of the demo was the boss fight with a giant Tryceratops-like creature, which not only charged us but could also teleport and had a lightning attack. Indeed, Saber had previously said that the Xenia aliens control some of the dinosaurs with their technology and have empowered them with it.</p>



<p>Turok: Origins doesn't have a release window yet, but it looked fairly polished based on the Gamescom 2025 demo. Whether its structure and content will be enough to draw players remains to be seen once the final version becomes available. Meanwhile, we can confirm that the game will run at 60 frames per second on consoles (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">except for the Xbox Series S version</a>). </p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA will Announce the Early Access Release Date for Skate Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-announce-the-early-access-release-date-for-skate-tomorrow.1279731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next entry in EA's Skate series will have its cover art revealed tomorrow, but more importantly, the early access release date for Skate is due to be announced in a new trailer premiering tomorrow, August 26, 2025, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BST.</p>



<p>EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-into-early-access-in-summer-2025-major-playtest-update-coming-july-2/">announced this past June</a> that Skate would launch in early access sometime this summer. Well, at the time of this writing, summer is nearly over, so if that's still the case, then we might see Skate get shadow-dropped tomorrow. Or, it'll be out in the coming weeks. Either way, Skate has been in closed playtesting for months at this point, and considering that it'll be an early access release, it feels like EA could decide to launch it at any point.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="skate. | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Which, admittedly, feels odd considering the amount of excitement there was around the return of the series when EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-new-studio-full-ciricle-staffing-up/">first announced it.</a> Back in 2021, when Full Circle was just starting up for the purposes of making this new Skate game, you never would have guessed that the hype around a Skate 4 would wane as much as it has, or that EA might just drop the game without much of a marketing lead-up.</p>



<p>In fairness, that was before we knew that this new iteration of Skate would be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">full live service-focused game</a>, and that it would require <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players to always be online</a>. Neither fact has helped ingratiate players to this new version, and it'll be interesting to see how the early access release fares once it is in public hands and no longer just for playtesters with access to a closed beta.</p>



<p>After years of waiting, tomorrow, Skate fans will finally have a date to look forward to for a new Skate game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With every <em>Story of Seasons</em> release, developing studio Marvelous gets closer and closer to finding the best recipe for a farming/life simulator, and <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> is its next remake that blends old-school farming sim mechanics with all of the quirks that made Zephyr Town a beloved location in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> is a remake of the original Grand Bazaar title, though it was called <em>Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar</em> at the time. The game sends players to Zephyr Town, where they not only take the role of the local farmer but also open a booth at the local bazaar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-farm-view.jpg?itok=VOXcfesh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-farm-view.jpg?itok=LctRgiJr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Certain areas around&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>give special views of the surrounding areas that change through the seasons.</figcaption></figure><p>In the latest iteration of the game, players are asked to grow the bazaar after the previous farmer left town years prior. There’s a storyline that drives this bazaar growth, making <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> more narrative-driven than ever before in the franchise (with the exception of perhaps <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="34bff8c7-b745-4cf9-b20f-236a7829b85f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/story-of-seasons-wonderful-life" rel="nofollow"><em>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</em></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every Saturday, players will sell anything they have at their own bazaar stall. The bazaar is also where players will buy most of their things, though there is a general store that carries seeds and animal food for emergencies.</p>

<p>That leaves the rest of the week for farming and general day-to-day activities, like talking to villagers and foraging for supplies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> Makes Every Area Shine</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-bazaar-day.jpg?itok=k8TWXc2R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-bazaar-day.jpg?itok=2dXaos11 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Selling at your own stall in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>makes the stakes of farming feel even higher as you appeal to customers and try to boost your profits.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Whether it’s a busy bazaar Saturday or a leisurely Tuesday, <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> makes every in-game day enjoyable. Between an impressive number of events around town and plenty to do, there’s a feeling that every day matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the bazaar days are constantly busy. Selling to customers involves getting their attention with a cowbell and placing items they like on display. Don’t be fooled, this is harder than it sounds – things get hectic easily, and it’s easy to lose the interest of some customers while you’re serving others.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-playing-with-pet.jpg?itok=MvE8fwZT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-playing-with-pet.jpg?itok=Ec5St1JC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The animals in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>are as full of life and love as the characters.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Events crop up around the map consistently as you get to know the characters, breathing life into an already-bustling town. Not only do these give each day meaning, they’re easy to find – a map with notifications when an event is happening and where leads you to where you need to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These events highlight all the villagers in Zephyr Town, and some of them are sweet glimpses into the lives of townspeople you’d otherwise know little about. These also do a great job at pushing the relationships of bachelors and bachelorettes and the main story.</p>

<p>All of this also helps push the idea that the player is welcome in a loving, full-of-life town. It also helps that, for the first time ever, the major events and story are completely voiced.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-windmill.jpg?itok=m2qEq-T5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-windmill.jpg?itok=9jG5vShL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The windmills in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>are the key to making high profits -- once you've restored them, of course.</figcaption></figure><p>Even without events, there are plenty of quests to focus on. Villagers will ask for help as your relationship with them builds. Additionally, you can endlessly gather materials and forage to donate to sprites. Not only does this give rewards, but it also increases various quality levels of the things you donate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, crafting things is a major part of the game, and crafting takes time. As you get further into the game, you’ll be going through long, multiple-step crafting formulas using a variety of materials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This isn’t something that’s really a big focus in newer games in the genre. It’s definitely something that adds complexity to a farming sim in a great way without being overbearing, and its presence in the remake is a welcome reminder of where the genre was nearly 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-mountain-view.jpg?itok=67jjSZMk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-mountain-view.jpg?itok=DlsgDy2r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the views around&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>give a hint at the world around Zephyr Town that some of the other characters frequently visit.</figcaption></figure><p>However, all of this does take a bit to set up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s easy to feel like things are slow at the beginning, as unlocking every available thing to do and starting to build relationships takes time. This does make the first Spring feel a bit slow, particularly if you know your way around farming sims or have played the original <em>Grand Bazaar</em> title.</p>

<p>After the first Spring, things progress at a nice pace, and I found I always had something to do around town the entire rest of the first year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even Spring of Year 2, while a bit slower on festivals, still had plenty for me to focus on doing. As someone who’s an avid farming/life sim lover, this was something I’d never really experienced in other games in the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Zephyr Town Has Never Been More Beautiful</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-sophie-and-june.jpg?itok=lzCR5pKN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-sophie-and-june.jpg?itok=KtrggFvO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>make every day an adventure between events, new dialogue, and quests.</figcaption></figure><p>It’d be easy for everything already mentioned to make a great <em>Story of Seasons</em> game, but <em>Grand Bazaar</em> outdoes itself with the aesthetics of Zephyr Town.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zephyr Town is arguably the best-looking town in <em>Story of Seasons</em> history, and it’s always been gorgeous. It strikes a great balance between the natural environment and a tiny, yet bustling, town, and the windmills and traversal mechanics have always been fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wind and movement mechanics, including jumping around and gliding to other areas, feel intuitive and make running around entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-fishing-in-the-rain.jpg?itok=hWMoKTL9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-fishing-in-the-rain.jpg?itok=BzvJi6AM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first time I heard the rainy day music in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em>, I fished all day just to listen to it.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>And then, perhaps the most surprising part of <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> for me was the music. Farming Sims aren’t known for their soundtracks, but <em>Grand Bazaar</em> had several gorgeous tracks that forced me to stop and appreciate them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Is One of The Best Yet</h2>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c66e36ec-389d-4125-b93f-0d46957d3097" href="https://techraptor.net/games/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar" rel="nofollow"><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em></a> is a home run for players who loved the original and an amazing introductory farming/life sim for newcomers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s cozy without being too simple, the characters and town are brimming with life, and it’s one of the prettiest <em>Story of Seasons</em> games. I had high hopes for the remake, and I’m glad to see that Marvelous did more than deliver – it awed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rumors are circling regarding the next Nintendo Direct event. According to multiple reports, Nintendo is planning to hold its next direct showcase sometime in September.</p>



<p>According to SwitchForce, who has been accurate with Nintendo information in the past, the next direct appears to be planned for September 12.</p>



<p>“Nintendo tried to phone in an emergency about the missing Switch 2 games, but they accidentally dialed 912,” <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>.</p>



<p>It’s not just SwitchForce claiming a direct is coming. While not confirming the date, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> did say that its own sources tell them that a mid-September Nintendo Direct is planned.</p>



<p>As far as what this upcoming direct would cover, that’s currently unknown. There has been speculation that it will focus on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, especially with it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-receives-esrb-rating-ahead-of-launch/">recently receiving an ESRB rating</a>. The game is also scheduled to release sometime this year, and with only four months left in the year, signs point to it being time to give fans a deeper dive into the game.</p>



<p>What are you hoping to see from the next Nintendo Direct? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Last year, Coffee Stain Studios brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> out of its half decade in early access with an announcement <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/satisfactory-is-now-in-the-works-for-consoles-following-1-0-launch-on-pc/1100-6526360/" data-ref-id="1100-6526360">that console versions would follow</a>. Now, the studio is inviting players on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S to join PC players on planet MASSAGE-2(A-B)b when Satisfactory launches on consoles on November 4.</p><p>In Satisfactory, players assume control of Pioneers who have traveled to an alien world on behalf of the mega corporation FICSIT Inc. to build factories and exploit the natural resources of MASSAGE-2 (A-B)b. You'll construct increasingly elaborate sets of automated machinery to mine, craft, and expand.</p><p>It's a big job, but luckily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a> is supported across all consoles and PC, and up to four players can work together via co-op.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TURoNOy6eC0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TURoNOy6eC0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The console versions of Satisfactory will launch with everything in the PC version up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/satisfactory-gets-a-1-0-release-and-flushable-toilets-in-september/1100-6524709/" data-ref-id="1100-6524709">the 1.1 update that debuted in June</a>. For example, the toilets will be flushable from the very beginning. The Xbox version supports game suspend, while on PlayStation, there is support for the integrated controller speaker support and haptics. There will also be performance presets, including Quality mode target at 30fps, Balanced at 40fps, and Performance at 60fps. Additionally, players can utilize cloud saves to take their assembled factories across consoles or PC, depending on which platform they choose to use.</p><p>Satisfactory isn't the only factory simulation game that's set on an alien world. Earlier this summer, developer Creepy Jar shared a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starrupture/" data-ref-id="5000-590982">StarRupture</a>, a game that seems very similar to Satisfactory, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starrupture-early-access-trailer-looks-more-dangerous-than-satisfactory/1100-6534020/" data-ref-id="1100-6534020">also more dangerous</a>. The alien inhabitants in this game appear to be very lethal. StarRupture will debut in early access on January 6, 2026.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Horizon 5 - Horizon Realms Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Earlier this month, an Australian car import company uploaded an Instagram post showing off a Playground Games employee digitally scanning a rare compact Japanese car, adding more fuel to the fire when the post mentioned that it was for a new Forza Horizon game. The Tokyo Game Show takes place September 25-28, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5799/" data-ref-id="2900-5799">Microsoft has in the past held dedicated showcases</a> during the event.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-review-its-about-four-wheeled-family/1900-6417778/">Forza Horizon 5 launched back in 2021</a>, and it saw the game's titular festival move to Mexico and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-biggest-game-of-2025-is-a-former-xbox-exclusive-analyst-says/1100-6533368/">the best-selling game on PS5 this year, per gaming analyst Alinea</a>. The game was well-reviewed and featured hundreds of vehicles to collect with frequent content updates, eventually <a href="https://x.com/GAMERNEWSonX/status/1958214507739922667" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reaching 50 million players across all platforms</a>.</p><p>Recently, the cadence of those updates has slowed down, leading many to suspect that developer Playground Games was gearing up for a sequel, in addition to its work on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-4-everything-we-know/1100-6485774/" data-ref-id="1100-6485774">next Fable game</a>. Japan has been a frequently requested location for a Forza Horizon game to take place in, as the country has a rich history and appreciation for car culture, car meets, and an infamous underground racing scene.</p><p>The rumors come after numerous layoffs and the cancellation of several games at Microsoft's game studios, and Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 was hit particularly bad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">with reportedly 50% of its staff affected</a>. The studio says that it still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-studio-turn-10-breaks-month-long-silence-on-its-future-following-recent-layoffs/1100-6533793/">plans to support the more-realistic counterpart to Forza Horizon</a>, with several events for the game having already kicked off recently.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is at long last expanding its trainer level cap.
</p>
<p>
At present, the maximum level for trainers is 50, but from 15th October this will be increased to 80 to rebalance the existing curve for more frequent level ups due to less XP required for each level.
</p>
<p>
As a result, some trainers may jump in level automatically if excessive XP past level 50 has already been gained. Niantic will share more details on how many levels in the future, but noted no trainers will drop in level.
</p>
<p>
Any tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 - 50 will be removed, while new tasks will be added for levels 71 - 80. Trainers at level 70 or higher will have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with others.
</p><p>
However, some existing rewards will be removed - notably, the level 50 exclusive jacket. While this will still be in-game for those trainers who have already received it, it will no longer be obtainable. Further, avatar items earned by reaching levels 40 - 50 before the update will not be available after 15th October.
</p>
<p>
To mitigate this, Pokémon Go will host an XP Celebration event from 25th August until 14th October, with extra XP rewards to help players level their trainers ahead of the level cap increase.
</p>
<p>
Event bonuses are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws</li>
<li>+3000 XP for winning raids</li>
<li>+3000 XP for winning Max Battles</li>
<li>Level-Up Research update for level 48 - now reduced from walking 25km eight times in a week to twice in a week</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Trainer Level change will not effect Pokémon levels, which will remain capped at Level 50.
</p>

<p>"I would say it looks better than the PS4 version"</p>

<figure><a title="FF7 Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/194501ab62791/ff7-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> was playable on Switch 2 last week at Gamescom, and it seems that most who managed to go hands-on with the game came away feeling pretty positive about it.</p>
<p>Now, in a new post from Digital Foundry advertising its latest DF Weekly episode, John Linneman has come out and said that FF7R is "the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2". High praise, indeed! Now, this is only from a short clip posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk/post/3lx6fxspghc2r">Bluesky</a>, so we might be missing a little bit of extra context here, but the overall sentiment is that this is a really solid Switch 2 port from Square Enix.</p>
<p>Here's what Linneman had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm gonna say right now, this is the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2. Seeing that game running at a stable 30fps, with that excellent motion blur especially, it looked fantastic. It was completely stable, it looked on par – actually I would say it looks better than the PS4 version, at a glance.</p>
<p>"If I had to guess – and I haven't been able to compare because we don't have footage – it's gonna fall somewhere between the PS4 and PS5 versions. So we'll see if that holds true for the final game, but that's the sensation I got while playing it. The image quality was absolutely superb, like it looked really great, it matched the 1080p screen. I was really, really happy about that. So that's a good one."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no firm release date for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade just yet, but it's supposedly still on track to launch later this year.</p>
<p>Square Enix is adopting a new approach with its games, striving to make as many of them available on all major platforms where possible. It recently detailed its efforts to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/square-enix-details-plan-to-reboot-and-awaken-its-business">'reboot and revive'</a> its business in the midst of challenging financial results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4’s release date is screeching into sight and is set to be one of the biggest releases in 2025, and we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview of Borderlands 4</a> at Gamescom raised our excitement levels for the title, which comes a whopping six years after the previous entry in the series landed, and there’s plenty to take in, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 billion guns featured</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to lock in for release, perhaps calling in sick from work for the day, we’ve got all the crucial release datte and start times information you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-borderlands-4-coming-out">When is Borderlands 4 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Claptrap is waiting. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>September 12 is the official release date for Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with Nintendo Switch 2 players having to wait a while longer until October 3</strong>.</p>



<p>With the Borderlands 4 release date now locked in and on the horizon, there shouldn’t be any changes to the release date. Gearbox has already made the rather unusual move of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-move-forward-after-randy-pitchford-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing the Borderlands 4 release date</a> forward, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-addresses-gta-6-release-date-rumors-after-borderlands-4-is-moved-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Randy Pitchford then denying</a> the decision had anything to do with Grand Theft Auto 6. </p>



<p>The release date was brought forward by “confidence in the game and development trajectory,” giving fans a nice early bonus. As mentioned, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 players have a little while longer to wait</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-start-times">Borderlands 4 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4’s official start times are yet to be announced, but listings on the PlayStation store suggest it will be available a midnight regionally.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UK PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-au/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian PlayStation Store</a> both have midnight in their respective time zones, while the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US PlayStation Store</a> has a midnight release in Eastern Time stated—though it’s unclear whether this means those in other US time zones will gain access at the same moment.</p>



<p>A midnight regional release would also open the door for players to gain earlier access by switching their time zone, which is much easier to do on Xbox Series X|S than it is on PlayStation. However, we won’t know for sure if this is possible until the release times are confirmed.</p>



<p>For easier viewing, the table below shows the release times in popular time zones. Please remember that these are subject to change; we’ll be sure to keep them updated.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Borderlands 4 Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">21:00 – September 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">23:00 – September 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">00:00 – September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">00:00 – September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">00:00 – September 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have always felt that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>’ mage class was more complete, perhaps even more dominant, than the game’s other two classes, the rogue and the warrior. But why was that? Former BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah has said it’s mostly about second edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/qwdaQo6Cdv4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently published video</a>, Darrah explained why the mage in BioWare’s much-loved 2009 role-playing game ended up feeling so much better to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's actually I would say more because the design space that Dragon Age: Origins was being built into was heavily influenced by second edition D&amp;D," Darrah, who worked at BioWare from 1997 to early 2021, said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So in that case, the reality is mages and rogues were less… they were thinner classes, they were simpler classes. And the mage was the stronger, more fully implemented, more fully considered class. Much more complicated, much more in terms of spells and such.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: Origins was not designed to be played with Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition rules, but rather it was built on a custom system that was heavily influenced by the design principles of the 2nd edition era of D&amp;D.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also said Origins’ more grounded tone affected the abilities of the warrior and the rogue, which in turn had more grounded abilities than in subsequent games in the fantasy franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, of all the Dragon Ages, Dragon Age: Origins is the most grounded. It's the one that's worrying the most about everything making perfect sense within the overall lore of the game. So, warriors and rogues in Origins basically don't have talents, or they don't have talents or skills that violate physics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whereas, as we move into Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition and Veilgard, you get a lot more things that are not really possible for someone to physically do.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s plenty of agreement with Darrah’s assessment from fans, particularly on his point about Origins’ more grounded setting and tone, but also on how important mages were to the game’s story. Morrigan, a mage party member, ended up one of the most popular in Origins. That was in part because she was powerful, but there were also… other considerations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this unbalance was rectified for subsequent Dragon Age games, as Darrah points out. But following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/report-sheds-new-light-on-dragon-age-the-veilguards-development-turmoil-reveals-dialogue-rewrite-sparked-by-forspokens-failure">the failure of Veilguard</a> and the layoffs that followed, fans often point to Origins as the kind of Dragon Age they would love to see BioWare return to one day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will that day come? It seems unlikely any time soon, given BioWare is focused squarely on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>. Darrah, meanwhile, via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarkDarrah" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel,</a> has been running through his time at the studio, explaining everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-has-there-never-been-a-dragon-age-origins-remaster-bioware-exec-explains-past-plans-and-continued-difficulties">why there has never been a Dragon Age: Origins remaster</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bioware-executive-producer-breaks-down-what-really-happened-to-anthem">what went wrong with Anthem</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
