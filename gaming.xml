		<p>It’s bloody freezing out and about in the UK right now, so I hope you’re all keeping nice and toasty with some added layers, fashionable scarves and silly bobble hats, as needed. But despite the chill over here, the games industry in doing its stretches and warming up for the year. Things are going to start getting really interesting again in the next few weeks, after the slumber that always settles in over the end of year holidays.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> has been prepping for a house move, so gaming has been limited to just a smidgeon of Astro Bot, which was a Christmas present, and a bit of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm.</li>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong>, meanwhile has been having a blast of nostalgia with RoboCop: Rogue City. The slow movement works for combat, but less so when doing detective work, but it’s really having the authentic likenesses and actors from the original movies represented that does it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, bringing a deeply realistic open-world RPG experience to players everywhere. It’s one of the most highly anticipated games of 2025, featuring a widely branching and immersive story that might leave newcomers feeling confused about what’s going on.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve pieced together a guide to tackle the topic: ‘Do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance first?’ The first game came out in 2018, and the second game is a direct follow-on from that title.</p>



<p>But do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance before 2? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a Sequel?</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a direct sequel to the first game, which was released in 2018. The events of the second game start very soon after the ending of the first title, with the player assuming control of the same protagonist in roughly the same game world.</p>



<p>That means that you might be feeling wary about going into such an expansive story with no idea of what happened in the first title.</p>



<p>Is it worth playing Kingdom Come Deliverance before KCD2, though?</p>



<p>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>In the game’s opening sequences, you’re given a step-by-step introduction to the universe, and Warhorse Studios, the game’s developer, has done a wonderful job of letting you know what happened in the first game while making it seem like a natural walkthrough.</p>



<p>You’ll learn about – or have the option to <strong>choose </strong>– what happened in the first game. Many themes pull across from KCD into KCDII, but if you’re completely new to the series and want to get started with the second game, you won’t feel like a fish out of water.</p>



<p>By itself, KCDII is a perfectly enjoyable game that can be appreciated by anyone who hasn’t played the first title. There are many flashback sequences and conversations that help you piece together the main character’s story before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-kingdom-come-deliverance-story-real">Is The Kingdom Come Deliverance Story Real?</h2>



<p>Most of the events that unfold in Kingdom Come Deliverance (and the sequel) are true-to-life. The historical figures are mostly real, and the setting is a like-for-like replica of real-world locations. The era has been represented perfectly by Warhorse Studios, which employed scores of experts to make sure everything was as accurate and authentic as possible.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s highly likely Henry of Skalitz <strong>wasn’t</strong> a real person. He’s a fictional rendition created to explore this wonderful world at a turbulent time.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-photomode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-photomode-answered.1079760/</guid>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, and previews are running wild. It’s scoring high in the early impressions – including mine. This open-world RPG from Warhorse Studios is a direct continuation of the 2018 epic, both of which are steeped in history and authenticity.</p>



<p>In this snapshot game guide, I’m answering one key question: ‘Does Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 have photomode?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-there-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Is There Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 does have photomode</strong>, but it’s a relatively unassuming, toned-down inclusion.</p>



<p>When you activate photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be presented with a freecam that you can move around, but that’s about it. There are no options to zoom, tilt, or alter the field of view, and there is no function that allows you to apply filters, or to edit the image in any way.</p>



<p>It’s simple, but it’s <strong>there</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Kingdom Come game, released in 2018, did <strong>not </strong>have a photomode, so users found it awkward to capture shots of the game’s environment. If you played on PC, there was a command to remove the UI, which was the best you could get.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has gone one step ahead of that in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 by including a basic photomode.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that this is where it ends for the feature, though. The team may enhance the photomode once the game has been released in full on February 4, adding poses, facial expressions, a time of day scroller, and frames. It’s likely not high on the list of pre-release priorities, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Use Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>If you’re playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with a controller, simply click both L3 and R3 together to open up the photomode menu.</p>



<p>If you’re playing the game with a keyboard, you need to tap F1 to open the photomode screen, but that can, of course, be rebound at your will.</p>



<p>That’s all there is to it – owing to the simplicity of the feature, there’s not much else to say.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivels-just-hit-a-new-peak-player-count-and-topped-steam%E2%80%99s-charts.1079748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to impress fans worldwide since being released in December. The increasingly popular hero shooter secured 20 million players by the end of December, and it has refused to move from the top of the charts in the days that have followed. Hours ago, Marvel Rivals hit a new peak player count on Steam as season one was rolled out.</p>



<p>The charts are little more than a plaything for Marvel Rivals, which is already defying the typical performance of a live-service game, getting stronger over time rather than ebbing away a month after release. There are no signs of the game slowing down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-performance">Huge Performance</h2>



<p>Following the deployment of the game’s first full season, the player count soared on Steam. Marvel Rivals secured a peak concurrent player count of 644,269 users, and for a time, it was the single-most popular game on Steam, beating the likes of Counter-Strike 2, which is by no means a simple feat.</p>



<p>NetEase hit the nail on the head with Marvel Rivals. It helps that the game had a pre-existing fan base, and one of the most engaged communities in the world at that, but it <strong>also </strong>helps that it offers a solid, enjoyable experience with few issues.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has untapped potential abound – there are so many characters that the developer can implement in the game, and that’s in addition to an already dense roster featuring Marvel’s greatest heroes. There are also some unsung gems in that crowd, of course.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 20 – 30 million people playing Marvel Rivals, or is the hero shooter not your kind of thing? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro is one of the most talented and consistent players in the Call of Duty League. While flying the OpTic Texas banner last year, he won the CDL Championship, securing yet another ring in the game he’s scarily good at. He’s one of just two esports pros in history to have earned a world championship title in two games, so he’s got a little prestige to his name.</p>



<p>Recently, the 23-year-old superstar exploded on social media, going on a rant against his peers and fellow CDL competitors. In a series of inflammatory comments posters on Twitter, the young player roasted others around him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-excuse">‘Another Excuse’</h2>



<p>It all began <a href="https://x.com/Shotzzy">when Shotzzy posted</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Most teams study break offs more than playing efficient – fkn idiots’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a response to a comment on that very post, Cuevas-Castro followed up by explaining: ‘Truly dgaf anymore I’m speaking wtf I think to day’. As fans settled in for the heel turn, Shotzzy then posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Players getting payment cuts every year and wonder why, fking clowns most yall guys don’t do shit besides collect a check’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His most devoted fans lauded his attitude, stressing that he’s ‘one of the only pros’ who applies ample effort to his content and career. Recently, Shotzzy proposed that organisations should stream their scrims to give fans of the Call of Duty League something to watch during the mid-stage breaks that happen once every few weeks.</p>



<p>He’s one of many COD pro players to stress recently that Black Ops 6 is in a dark place.</p>



<p>From there, Shotzzy got even more aggressive:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘8s don’t help this and that SnD 8s WON ME CHAMPS AND EVERY TOURNAMENT I HAVE EVER WON another excuse of not playing the game lazy fucks’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He capped off his rant with a coupe de grace:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Gonna chill now but yo @ most cdl pros put the fries in the bag in a couple years ty</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After that, Shotzzy kicked off a stream on Twitch. It’s possible this was all a plan to generate engagement before leaping onto a stream and capturing an enthralled audience. It could also be the player’s true feeling bubbling to the surface after containing them for quite a while.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that the Call of Duty esport scene isn’t in the best shape, but is it up to the players themselves to heft it up onto their shoulders and bring it back to life? Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Nickmercs has announced a withdrawal from FaZe Clan, an organisation he has been with for more than five years. In a lengthy announcement posted on social media, both Nickmercs – real name Nick Kolcheff – and FaZe Clan posted an emotional farewell message.</p>



<p>The content creator, who at times has been highly controversial, let his followers know that it’s not a ‘bad blood’ situation and that he has ‘no issues with them whatsoever’, it’s ‘just that time to move forward’. He didn’t explain if he’ll be joining a new organisation but stressed that on Monday, he’ll have a ‘huge announcement’ to share.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>On social media, Nickmercs wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, I wanna let y’all know that we are no longer with FaZe Clan. No issues with them whatsoever, it’s just that time to move forward. Y’all know I gotta lot of love for Banks, Tommy, Rug, Apex etc &amp; wish them &amp; the boys all the best. Beyond grateful for the memories &amp; achievements we had together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, FaZe Clan then posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NickMercs, you joined FaZe at the worst possible time. The fact we made it 5 years with you just goes to show what kind of a guy you are. We clicked almost immediately and always felt like you were truly one of the boys. “Cut from the same cloth” if you will. You repped this FaZe shit and rode through the absolute worst period of its existence.</p>



<p>He’s hard planted in Michigan building MFAM and taking care of his beautiful family. It’ll always be nothing but love for you big guy. Best of luck in your future endeavors</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nickmercs was one of FaZe Clan’s most prominent creators, boasting a following of 10.8 million users between Twitch and YouTube alone. He has been streaming for years and regularly partners with some of the biggest content creators in the business.</p>



<p>Recent years were not smooth sailing for the 34-year-old. In 2023, he landed himself in hot water following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-drama-subscribers/">an anti-LGBTQ tirade</a>, but his return after the debacle saw him rack up 11,000 subscribers in a single stream. Later that year, he came under fire for signing a contract with Kick.com that included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-kick-gambling/">a requirement to host gambling streams</a>.</p>



<p>Then, in June 2024, Nickmercs was banned from Twitch for the first time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-banned-from-twitch/">for using a ‘transphobic slur’</a> while talking in the wake of the Dr Disrespect controversy. </p>



<p>Since then, the ship has been righted and the creator is back on top where he loves to be.</p>



<p>Will you miss Nickmercs following his departure from FaZe Clan? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Five Nights at Freddy’s has become wildly popular in recent years, earning itself a movie adaptation in 2023 and boasting a catalog filled with over a dozen horror games. Later this year, two of its most recent games, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Into the Pit</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-Nights-Freddys-Wanted-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DFRLZBP8?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Help Wanted 2</a>, are getting physical editions after previously only launching in digital formats (or making physical formats only available on select platforms). Both titles earned positive reviews, and if you’re a fan of the series, they’re an easy recommendation. Best of all, Into the Pit comes with a nice bonus when you purchase the physical edition.</p><p>Into the Pit’s physical edition is expected to arrive on June 20, while Help Wanted 2 will get physical editions for Switch and Xbox Series X around March 31 (though that date is likely to change). <strong>Preorders are now open ahead of their release</strong>, so consider reservering a copy if you plan on playing them later this year.</p><div title="6528746 - Into the Pit and Help Wanted 2 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3050" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6528746 - Into the Pit and Help Wanted 2 Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Five Nights at Freddy’s: Into the Pit</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases June 20</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The physical edition of Into the Pit will eventually launch for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Pit-PlayStation/dp/B0DSLVS2N6?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Pit-Xbox/dp/B0DSLTKBQR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Pit-PlayStation/dp/B0DSLTKH3N?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>, though only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DSLVYMGL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> version is currently available to preorder.

                <p>Candy Crush is getting another feather in its cap. Rather than offering another twist on match-three puzzling, Candy Crush Solitaire will bring the franchise's sickly sweet aesthetic to the card game classic. It will be the first Candy Crush game to release after Microsoft's acquisition of developer King.</p><p>Candy Crush Solitaire bases itself on tripeaks solitaire, in which players must clear three "peaks" of cards. The game will feature familiar power-ups from Candy Crush, including jelly fish, the lollipop hammer, the color bomb, and the UFO. They will offer similar, but not exactly the same, powers as their match-three counterparts. Much like other Candy Crush games, the basic solitaire gameplay will be altered and made more challenging as players progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHVpfZIpPL8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lHVpfZIpPL8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Candy Crush Solitaire will launch worldwide on February 6. Players can pre-register now on the app store of their choice and they'll receive some in-game rewards: 5,000 Coins, four undos, two fish cards, and three color bomb cards.</p><p>Back in 2022, when Microsoft's now-completed acquisition of Activision Blizzard (which included King in its holdings) was still uncertain, Xbox boss Phil Spencer claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-activision-blizzard-deal-is-focused-on-candy-crush-not-call-of-duty/1100-6509176/" data-ref-id="1100-6509176">the purchase was more motivated by King</a>, and by extension the mobile market, than console games like Call of Duty. Since Microsoft's acquisition, Xbox has emphasized its mobile and Smart TV offerings with the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">This is an Xbox</a>" campaign.</p>

Health is basically zero. I need help. So I step past a demonic dog and enter a dark, ominous bathroom. I quickly knock on the lone stall inside. It creaks open, I hear...something inside and then a single soda can rolls out. Instead of drinking it, however, I gamble, and knock again. And once again it rolls me a soda. I don’t press my luck, instead returning to the aforementioned evil dog and giving it one of my soda pops. It chugs it and, in exchange, lets me reload my weapons faster. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196131,195410" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After that, it’s right back to the action of running for my life from a pixelated burning apartment while fighting cultists using a revolver, melee items, and my foot. It’s all very weird, but it’s also a blast, and I keep returning to play more <em>Cruel</em>, even though I keep dying over and over. </p><p>Over the last few years we’ve seen the rise of the boomer shooter subgenre of FPS games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">Stuff like <em>Cultic, Dusk, Fashion Police Squad</em>, and <em>40K Boltgun</em></a></span> all look like older <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-shooters-2022-pc-destiny-warzone-fortnite-apex-1849853877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-shooters-2022-pc-destiny-warzone-fortnite-apex-1849853877">shooters</a></span> from the ‘90s, but often leverage new technology and decades of game design to create shooters that feel retro, but fresh. The latest of these boomer shooters to catch my attention with its fast-paced, roguelike action is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cruel</em>, out now on Steam</a></span>. </p><p>In <em>Cruel</em>, you play as someone trapped in a building that is burning floor by floor. Like any good character from a ‘90s-era FPS you are always running, which is helpful in this case as the fire will kill you quick if you linger. Each floor of the building is filled with cultists, evil ghosts, and soda machines. These machines will heal you if you need it, or you can use the soda to upgrade your character between floors. </p><p>And you’ll need those upgrades, as each floor gets harder and introduces new enemies with better weapons. And if you drink all your soda, well, you can always gamble in the bathroom and hope the evil monster in there gives you a soda and doesn’t jumpscare you and kill you where you stand. Like I said, it’s a weird experience. </p><p>But <em>Cruel’s </em>oddball setup isn’t what keeps me coming back to the game death after death. Instead, it’s the game’s crisp, responsive, and retro-inspired FPS combat. Guns are loud. Enemies pop when you get that perfect headshot. And one mistake can end a perfect run. Then again, if you use all the tools <em>Cruel</em> provides you with—slides, kicks, and melee weapons—you can often improvise your way out of a bad situation. </p><p><em>Cruel </em>reminds me of last year’s <em>Anger Foot</em>, but with better combat and a crunchier, more boomer shooter-inspired aesthetic. The soundtrack is a banger to boot. Oh, and if you click the reload button when your gun has full ammo, your character flips it in the area. 10 out of 10. Love it! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At only $10 and under 400MB</a></span>, <em>Cruel </em>is a perfect bite-sized FPS to kick the new year off with, just don’t gamble too much in the bathroom. Trust me. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2023, Evil Geniuses won VALORANT Champions, claiming just the third ever world championship in Riot’s tactical FPS. Less than two years later, only one face remains: coach Christine “potter” Chi.</p>



<p>Potter, a former Counter-Strike pro who first joined EG as a player in 2021, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potter-signs-three-year-extension-with-eg-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed an extension this offseason</a> to continue coaching through 2027. The team also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed Jacob “icy” Lange and once-upon-a-time best player in the world Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker</a>.</p>



<p>This year, the goal for potter is the same as it always is: do more with less.</p>



<hr>



<p>Insider Gaming had the opportunity to sit down with potter at the VCT Americas Media Day. The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: At the SEN City Classic you talked about wanting to work with that roster specifically, but what led to the team ending up with icy as opposed to&nbsp;Tyler “sym” Porter?</strong></p>



<p>“My mindset towards rosters has always been tunneled towards making it work, no matter what. I’ve never looked at it from the angle of ‘when can I replace this player?’ So when I said that at the time, I fully believed that would be our roster in 2025.</p>



<p>After that tournament though, it was clear there were some issues with sym. I do really wish we could have made it work; sym is incredibly talented, he’s really hungry, an incredible teammate and a really good human. But the time issue was always on my mind, with trying to bring yay into a comfortable environment and highlighting him to be successful. We need to make sure everyone was playing their roles properly, especially with all of yay’s role changes and not being as comfortable on the sentinel role.</p>



<p>This roster that we’re going into Kickoff with, this combination of players turned out to be better for us.”</p>

<p><strong>IG: The last time you kept the same roster core between years was from 2022 to 2023, and we all know how well 2023 turned out. How important is it to keep the same core together through the offseason?</strong></p>



<p>“It’s so important. Even at that time, I was getting so much shit from the community, my peers, from some in management about replacing certain players on that 2023 roster. But I knew keeping a core was going to be important. All the work, all the small annoyances that teams have to do that take so much time, that was already out of the way [in 2023].</p>



<p>And it’s the same with this roster in 2025. We took last year to hash out a lot of those details, to learn about each other, get those fundamentals down. All those things are done. And yeah we lost Alexander “jawgemo” Mor, and that fucking hurt really badly, and it hurt us as a team. But, we put in a lot of work last year, and we feel very confident about that work we put in.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: What do you hope to see out of both yay and Icy? What can they bring to the table that VCT Americas viewers haven’t seen yet?</strong></p>



<p>“Over the last three years, EG has been a place where every player ends up not by choice, but more so by how things turned out. Each player has their own hunger, and drive, and story they want to rewrite for themselves. And that’s always been my strength: having these misfit players with their own desperate drive they need to prove. I see exactly [those kind of players] in yay and icy. </p>



<figure><figcaption>In his OpTic days, yay was regarded as the best VALORANT player in the world. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With yay, he’s gonna have to prove that he’s not just a Chamber main. That’s his ultimate goal. He’s swapped over to the sentinel role, and every day it’s a work in progress. We have El Diablo on our team, but we still need him to do his job, which sometimes isn’t as sexy as going out there and getting three crispy headshots. Sometimes he’s gonna have to play off of his trip, and it’s small things like this we’re working out as a team. He’s such a capable player, but sometimes being that capable can bait you into into certain engagements that don’t make sense.</p>



<p>For icy, he’s an incredible role player. His IQ is up there, he’s humble, and he’s a very sacrificial duelist. As a duelist, you have to be greedy, but you also have to be willing to go in there and die for your team. So my focus for him is to highlight his mechanical skill. That consistency wasn’t there last year, and I’m hoping he finds that here on this roster.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: You had the prestige and name power to go coach another team. What made you want to stay with EG?</strong></p>



<p>“I did get a lot of offers, and they were all exactly the same: building up a roster of misfits or players that need to prove themselves from tier two or tier three. I did want to look at a team that was willing to spend the big bucks on big names, but that didn’t work out. A lot of the rumors are true. I did look into NRG, and those talks did go pretty far, but they went a different route. At that point it was either go somewhere brand new and do what I’m already doing here, or continue what I’ve done at EG with the core I’ve already built here.</p>



<p>I fully believe in Phat “supamen” Le, in the same way I was fully convinced jawgemo was going to be the best duelist at the end of the year. Turns out he wasn’t even our main duelist!”</p>



<p><strong>IG: He wasn’t even the best duelist on EG!</strong></p>



<p>“[Laughs] Right! And NaturE is a top IGL. He and I have worked so long together, and we’re in that sweet spot. And Derrek is casually good, and I like that. In practice and matches, he’s not straining for highlights. His energy is fantastic.</p>



<p>I really stayed because I believe in this core. I think we made the right roster moves. Yay is a big question mark, but he absolutely is elevating us and catapulting us up like how Ethan and Demon1 did in 2023. So I’m excited about this roster.”</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is getting local co-op support next month - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.
</p>
<p>
Not coincidentally, of course, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix (which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a>) and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.
</p>

And Epic has now revealed that, from Tuesday 14th January, Fortnite Festival will get a little closer to capturing the social spirit of those heady Rock Band days, by letting multiple players jam away in the comfort of the same room - but only on Xbox and PlayStation. The company hasn't shared much in the way of specifics just yet, but judging by the <a href="https://x.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921">excessively elaborate, Snoop Dogg-starring trailer</a> it's released to announce the new feature, it'll support local co-op for up to four players, as well as the simultaneous use of two plastic guitars.

This marks the first major new feature for Fortnite Festival this year, and follows Epic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-commits-to-rock-band-like-festival-musical-mode-support-through-2025-and-beyond">confirmation last December</a> that it would continue to support its rhythm game through "2025 and beyond". It made those assurances after revealing it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">no longer be releasing themed updates for Fortnite's Rocket Racing</a>, which has struggled to maintain player numbers since being introduced alongside Fornite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in 2023.
</p><p>
The arrival of Fortnite Festival's local co-op support on 14th January coincides with the end of the mode's current Snoop Dogg-themed season and the start of the next, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">likely see Vocaloid popstar Hatsune Miku step in as the latest featured artist</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/what-we-played-marvel-rivals-destiny-2-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first full week of the year definitely picked up the pace again, and there’s been plenty of headlines, new trailers and general stuff happening in video games. And there’s also new games coming out sooner than you might think!</p>
<p>I’ve had an old platformer on the go that you’ll hear about next week, and&nbsp;I also played a few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to cobble together a preview video for the game earlier today.</p>
<p>But it’s <strong>Gamoc</strong> who on point for our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, and it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">his first impressions</a> that we were able to share in our final preview. He’s really been enjoying it so far, so keep your eyes peeled for our review next month! That’s not all he’s been playing, though. There’s also been some bits of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Black Ops 6, and Terraria with his sister (who’s having to put up with just having a PS4 for the time being).</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> also been playing Kingdom Come… but only the first one – “My enjoyment took a momentary dip during the notoriously dull monastery main quest in which you become a novice monk, performing mundane daily duties while also investigating which of your fellow brothers is a criminal. It was great in terms of historical immersion but was surprisingly punishing. I much preferred my next quest, giving the villagers of Pribyslavitz a good telling off for pooing in the nearby river.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> continuing adventures through The Witcher 3 have taken him through Novigrad, where he’s just picking up quests and some Witcher contracts. He’s also been on the sidelines of Football Manager 24, getting Valencia to the Champions League semi finals, but getting knocked out, meaning he’s just got the slimmest of hopes left for a league win if Real Madrid and Barcelona ever slip up.</p>

<p>There’s been a fair bit of Marvel Rivals for <strong>Jason</strong>, where he’s been having to do an awful lot of carrying as the team healer. Alongside that it’s been Atlyss – &nbsp;“a very enjoyable MMO-style game with some, uh, very specific character models.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> and his wife have reached the final credits of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, so now there’s just all the catching of fishes, bugs and everything else still to do!</p>
<p>While <strong>Dom</strong> was feeling like he was going to be crushed under the sheer weight of a Lenovo Legion Go – he is, after all, a very small person, and it is a large handheld – <strong>Miguel</strong> has been mainlining gacha games including Girls Frontline 2, some Zenless Zone Zero, a pinch of Nikke and a whisper of Honkai Star Rail. Also some Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on PSP!</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> wrapped up and enjoyed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (except for that stupid map), and so has gone back to Another Crab’s Treasure. He also played the first few hours of Alone in the Dark on PS5 and trawled through FromSoftware’s back catalogue to play Ninja Blade on 360 – his PC version is stuck in German, somehow?</p>

<p>And aside from being disappointed by the final act of Destiny 2’s story after The Final Shape, <strong>Tuff’s</strong> been playing “writing a CV” for the first time in 28 years, which is both a new and old experience.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>

All of a sudden it’s digital Jenga time and you have to figure out what to delete from your library. Or you could this one quick thing and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-ssd-western-digital-price-8tb-preorder-release-date-1851626940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-ssd-western-digital-price-8tb-preorder-release-date-1851626940">quickly free up a bunch of space on your SSD</a></span>, maybe even enough to finish installing whatever’s stuck in your download queue. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trick I’m talking about is deleting all your trophy footage in the media folder. The PS5 is over four years old now. If you’ve been playing since launch, there’s a good chance you’ve earned a bunch of achievements across all of the games you’ve played, and mementos from those milestones are clogging up your SSD. I knew my PS5 was doing this but I didn’t realize just how much space it was taking up. </p><p>Fortunately, I came across <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this really helpful PSA by user wolfgang784</a></span> over on the PlayStation 5 subreddit today. “Just found over 2200 videos while trying to free up space and wondering why my media folder was so big,” the thread reads. Wolfgang784 points out that the PS5 records and stores a 15-second clip of your gameplay every time a trophy pops. If you aren’t vigilant, all of those clips can add up quick. Here’s how to fix that:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Turn on your PS5</li><li>Go to the gear icon on the far right of the home screen to access settings</li><li>Choose the storage option and open up the media folder</li><li>toggle over to the trophy category and then select all and hit delete</li></ol><figure id="" data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like I said, it’s a very simple fix that’s easy to overlook. At least that’s what I tell myself to explain why I never noticed this until now. Usually I’m sorting through albums for various games trying to figure out what precious clips I want to delete to try and win back one precious gigabyte here and another there from my precious SSD space. In addition to everything else, the dedicated trophy section of the media folder makes it easy to quickly nuke a ton of footage without worrying.</p><p>After that, you can go and change the settings for what’s recorded when you earn a trophy. It can be just a screenshot, or you can limit captures to only gold or platinum trophies. If you’re serious about documenting all of that stuff, then by all means feel free to hang onto it or move it to an external drive before purging. I am not, and instantly got back 7GB of storage. </p><p>That’s not much when it comes to behemoth game file sizes like <em>Destiny 2 </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, but as someone who recently went through their digital collection and downloaded a ton of stuff I’ve never played, 7GB is enough to install half a dozen smaller indie games or older PlayStation classics. One of these days I’ll install a bigger SSD. Until then, thank you, wolfgang784, for the super useful tip. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Metroid fans have been waiting for the better part of two decades for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The sequel was officially announced in June 2017, and Amazon put up preorders sometime after that. Through the game's extended development, those orders still stood. Now, even after last summer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">re-reveal of Metroid Prime 4</a>, Amazon is canceling those longstanding preorders.</p><p>Presumably this is a mistake on Amazon's end, rather than anything dire like another delay for Metroid Prime 4 or even a cancelation of the game itself. GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment. At least one person on GameSpot's staff noted that his six-year-old Metroid Prime 4 preorder--which was discounted to $48--was among the canceled orders today.</p><p>Following the initial announcement in 2017, Nintendo updated the status of Metroid Prime 4 in 2019 when it was revealed that the previous development was being abandoned in favor of a fresh start with Retro Studios, the same studio that developed the Metroid Prime trilogy. During the years between announcements, a standalone title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-dread-review-space-truckin/1900-6417757/" data-ref-id="1900-6417757">Metroid Dread</a> and a remastered edition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were released on Switch. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-2-and-3-are-reportedly-still-coming-to-switch/1100-6511589/" data-ref-id="1100-6511589">are both reportedly getting remasters for Switch</a> as well.</p><p>Aside from those games, Metroid's leading woman, Samus Aran, remains a regular in the Super Smash Bros. franchise. But to stay current with Samus' in-continuity adventures, you should probably brush up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-the-series-story-so-far/1100-6524350/" data-ref-id="1100-6524350">everything that's happened in the Metroid Prime games so far</a>. Nintendo recently reiterated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-re-emerges-reiterates-2025-release/1100-6527895/" data-ref-id="1100-6527895">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be released in 2025</a>, but it doesn't currently have an exact date.</p>

Keep in mind this likely isn’t a complete list and it’s possible that more games will be announced for PS4 later in the year.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em></strong> (PS5/PS4, Switch) - January 7</li><li><strong><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch) - January 10</li><li><strong><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 17</li><li><strong><em>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 23</li><li><strong><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - January 30</li><li><strong><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, PC, Switch) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Tomb Raider IV-V-VI </em>Remastered</strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S ) - February 21</li><li><strong><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</em></strong><em> </em>(PS4, PS5, PC, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 6</li><li><strong><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Atomfall</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 27</li><li><strong><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - April 24</li><li><strong><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, PC, Mobile) - June</li><li><strong><em>Double Dragon Revive</em></strong> (PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, XSX/S) - October 23</li><li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> </strong>(PS4/5, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></strong> (PC, Switch, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Splitgate 2</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS5, PS4, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>The House of the Dead 2: Remake</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>WWE 2K25</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li></ol><p>Now, as mentioned before with the PS2, it’s not unheard of for very popular video game consoles to keep receiving new game releases a decade after the device first hit the market. A big install base is a big install base. But usually, this far into a console’s lifespan, you might get, say, one or two new games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For example, in 2018</a></span>—12 years after the PlayStation 3 launched—we got two new PS3 games, and one was <em>FIFA 19. </em></p><p>What we’re seeing with the PS4 in its 12th year is unlike anything in modern gaming history. Nearly two dozen games, at least, are set to arrive on PS4 this year, and not all of them are sports games or old ports. Some are brand new remasters, others are smaller 2D titles, and some are big AAA games like <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> and <em>Elden Ring Nightreign.</em> </p><h2 id="h283710"><a id=""></a>Console generations aren’t the same as before</h2><p>And before someone jumps on me for suggesting PS4 games launching in 2025 is a bad thing, let me be clear: I’m not saying that. Most AAA video game studios have moved on to more powerful hardware, so I don’t think the industry is being held back by the PS4 (or the Xbox One, for that matter, which is also getting new games.)</p><p>The reality is that in 2025, the video game industry and market are very different than they once were. Back in the era of the PS2 and even PS3, tech was advancing rapidly from 2D to 3D to HD to 4K. New consoles felt more necessary every few years. That’s not the case in 2025. </p><p>The PS4 is still a fairly capable machine, especially for indie devs or people making smaller games or RPGs using pre-established tools and tech. And thanks to digital marketplaces, you don’t need to stock your game at Walmart to sell copies. It also helps that modern engines like Unreal and Unity are very scalable and flexible, so a single game can run on Switch, PS4, PS5, and even mobile devices. </p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that some of the most popular games around right now—<em>Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Genshin Impact, Overwatch 2, GTA Online, Minecraft, </em>and <em>Roblox</em>—are all on PS4, and still receive updates each month. There’s a giant group of players who don’t feel the need to move on because the big games they play every week are still active and alive on PS4, so it’s not shocking that devs are still making plenty of games for the 12-year-old console in 2025. </p><p>The real question now is whether the PS4 can last longer than the PS2. I think it can. Even if, come next year, we only see half as many PS4 games launch as we get in 2025, that’ll still be over 10. We might even be getting PS4 games up until and beyond the launch of a theoretical PS6. Wild stuff. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this week, Los Angeles and surrounding cities in California were struck by multiple wildfires and intense Santa Ana winds that caused catastrophic damage to Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and other areas. Major Hollywood events and pro sports games were canceled in the wake of the fires. However, Niantic has announced that it still plans to go forward with next month's Pokemon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles event in Pasadena's Rose Bowl stadium.</p><p>"Our team has been carefully observing the situation in Los Angeles with the well-being of Pasadena, greater Los Angeles, and of course our Niantic community," said Niantic's director of communications, Mark Van Lommel, in a statement to <a href="https://dotesports.com/pokemon/news/niantic-is-carefully-observing-the-situation-in-los-angeles-ahead-of-pokemon-go-unova-tour" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dos Esports</a>. "While we are currently continuing our preparations, any updates regarding the event will be shared as they become available."</p><p>The Los Angeles fires are still ongoing and have been hugely devastating to the community and the people who live there.

Prior to the fires, Niantic announced that the event will mark the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-january-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-day-and-more/1100-6528604/" data-ref-id="1100-6528604">Pokemon Go</a> debut of Black Kyurem and White Kyurem ahead of their global rollout on March 1.</p><p>Late last year, Niantic revealed that it has used the activities of Pokemon Go players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-used-pokemon-go-players-to-create-real-world-ai-navigation-model/1100-6527871/" data-ref-id="1100-6527871">to create a real-world AI navigation model</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a preview of an upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. This more experimental spin-off of a Secret Lair, which quietly launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in December</a>, is continuing its eclectic streak with some new psychedelic land cards.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault 2025 Drop</h2>

<p>IN an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast briefly restates the intention of the Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. They are designed to be unexpected. Sales launching at unexpected times to selling unexpected items. The post also confirms an email list for updates on future Chaos Vault drops.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=d_h9_YkZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=JUXqkmW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post continues with a preview of the drop. Starting "sometime next week" the next drop will feature new basic land cards. These land cards showcase a vibrant art style with abstract, rainbow-like colors by artist Scott Balmer. They look more like background vignettes to a prog-rock album than a fantasy landscape.</p>

<p>If you are worried about cost, this latest Chaos Vault drop will try something different. Buying this Chaos Vault drop will get you ten copies of each basic land card by popular demand. That is fifty cards in total as part of this drop. In keeping with the chaotic nature of these drops, there is no current listed price.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-koi-pond-artwork.jpg?itok=Vf-wST80 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-koi-pond-artwork.jpg?itok=Bd4yyP-C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, the post ends with a tease of what other Chaos Vault drops will entail. It features several pieces of artwork by Rhonda Libbey, Heikala, Ashley Mackenzie, and kelogsloops. The artwork moves back and forth between watercolor vignettes, cozy anime imagery, and impressionistic koi ponds.</p>

<p>This promise of experimentality is in keeping with the first Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. That drop, titled the Fairest Drop of All, had several cards in the style of art deco title plates. One card was illustrated in full profile. If this is maintained, Chaos Vault could serve as an outlet for alternative artists and to entice players with more eclectic taste.</p>
