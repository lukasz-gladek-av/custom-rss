              <p>On Sunday, Vince Zampella, executive vice president at EA, head of Respawn, and one of the devs who helped create <em>Call of Duty</em>, was reportedly killed in a car crash in Southern California.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/"><em>NBC4</em> reported that Zampella</a> was killed in a single-car crash that happened on December 21 at 12:45 pm local time on a road north of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Mountains. California Highway Patrol told the outlet that the car veered off the road and collided with a concrete barrier. The car’s passenger was ejected from the vehicle. The driver was reportedly trapped in the ensuing car fire and died at the scene. The passenger reportedly died later at a nearby hospital.</p> <p>No details have been released as to why the car crashed, nor did <em>NBC</em> specify if Zampella was driving. <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA.</p> <p>The 55-year-old game developer was one of the key people behind the creation of <em>Call of Duty.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/when-call-of-dutys-creators-left-they-took-a-lot-of-pe-5817329">He later left that franchise</a> and helped co-found Respawn in 2010 with fellow <em>CoD</em> developer Jason West. The studio’s first game was the critically acclaimed Xbox-only, EA-published <em>Titanfall</em>. It would later produce a sequel, a popular battle royale spin-off, and two highly successful <em>Star Wars</em> action games, <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em> and <em>Jedi: Survivor.</em> In 2017, Respawn was acquired by EA and became a key part of the publisher’s roster of studios. In 2021, Zampella was put in charge of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-modern-day-specialists-classes-release-da-1851649399"><em>Battlefield</em> and helped the series rebound</a> with this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-sales-black-ops-7-charts-2000645794">massively successful <em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a> which is one of 2025’s biggest games of the year. Meanwhile, the franchise he helped create, <em>Call of Duty</em>, continues to be one of the biggest game franchises in the world.</p> <p><em>This is a developing story…</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Grand Theft Auto franchise was very close to branching out with a game set in the Japanese capital of Tokyo, a former Rockstar dev confirmed, before eventually being scrapped.</p>



<p>GTA has become synonymous with the USA over the years, with Rockstar creating the likes of Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City as counterparts to New York, California, and Florida, and it’s been over 25 years since GTA briefly visited the streets of London, and an exit from North America now seems extremely unlikely.</p>



<p>However, a game based in Tokyo was on the agenda in the past and “almost happened,” though the idea was later scrapped.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-tokyo-almost-happened">GTA: Tokyo Almost Happened</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Almost. Image via Rockstar</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesHub</a>, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij, who worked on the likes of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas, confirmed that discussions did take place for a Tokyo-based version of the game to release.</p>



<p>“We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan was going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn’t happen in the end,” he said.</p>



<p>With the GTA franchise ballooning further since the release of GTA V, and the huge anticipation for GTA 6, Vermeij believes the time has passed for a move to another continent to take place, and believes it wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>“People love having these wild ideas, but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicentre of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>



<p>“I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work.”</p>



<p>Additionally, while fans have been holding out hope for the bottom of the GTA 6 map to be expanded to include some of the Caribbean, or even Colombia, Vermeij believes it’s still unlikely to happen, even though he admits it’s something he would enjoy.</p>



<p>“I would love that. I think drug running is a good match. I was actually constantly trying to push to get that into the earlier games but it never happened. But is that what Rockstar are doing? I don’t think so. It doesn’t really make sense. It’s a lot of extra work for what it would be.”</p>

The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.</p><p>All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.</p><p>WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years. The impending closure is a bummer for people who want to keep playing online, but this kind of thing is not uncommon in the world of sports games and beyond, for 2K and other publishers.</p><p>In September this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-shutting-down-servers-for-these-two-games-soon/1100-6534421/" data-ref-id="1100-6534421">2K shut off the online servers for The Golf Club 2019 and PGA Tour 2K21</a>.

Like other Fanatical deals, you choose from a catalog of 21 games (all of which are offered as official keys for your Quest), and the more you buy, the more you'll save. <strong>Buy two or more games to get each for $9, four or more for $8.75/each, and seven or more for $8.50/each.</strong> If you want, you can add 21 games to your bundle, in which case you'll pay $178.50--while that's higher than most Fanatical bundle deals, it's still a massive 65% savings compared to the bundle's $471.79 value.</p><p>As for the games in the bundle, if you're a fan of Superhot, take a peek at Chronostrike. The stylized shooter emphasizes cooperative play, tasking you and a buddy to take down hordes of foes while deflecting bullets, manipulating time, and making liberal use of your environment to your advantage. There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Genndy Tartakovsky is a creative whose reputation precedes him. Ever since getting his foot in the door on the 1993 Hanna-Barbera show <em>2 Stupid Dogs</em>, he's become a household name in animation as the director and creator of<em> Dexter's Laboratory</em>, <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>, <em>Samurai Jack</em>, <em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em>, the <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> movies, and his latest and most<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dudes-rock?ref=aftermath.site"><u> dudes rock</u></a> series, <em>Primal</em>. <em>Primal</em>'s elevator pitch is that of a bespoke shower thought: What if a caveman named Spear teamed up with a dinosaur named Fang and went on an adventure that’d tickle the brains of folks who remember <em>Deadliest Warrior</em>?&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JyB3Md1GcWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Genndy Tartakovky's Primal | Season 3 Early Preview | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p><em>Primal </em>&nbsp;ran for two seasons before Spear died. Now, it’s poised to return for a new season on Adult Swim, with an even wilder premise to crank the series to 11: What if the caveman were a zombie now? Speaking with Tartakovsky, this new, pulpier direction was born from his undying belief that he ended the show too early and still had more story to tell, despite operating in a world where original animation is bottlenecked by the safer option of adding more legacy sequels and franchises to streamers.</p><p>“I spent 20 episodes trying to build the character relationship and the stories for everyone to fall in love with, and then it was over,” Tartakovsky said. “But then I realized, no, there’s still more that feels fresh. I think it was a joke at first like, ‘Maybe he’s a zombie’ because we’re talking about how to bring him back. And then I was like, ‘Wait a second. No, no, no, no, this is really good.’”</p><p>Whenever jokes turn into creative roadmaps for Tartakovsky, he puts his instincts to the test to see if they’re correct. Literally bringing <em>Primal</em> back to life after a premature end involved writing down 10 story ideas for how it could happen and where the story could go from there.</p><p>“I wrote them down so quick, which always means it’s ripe,” Tartakovsky said. “It’s ripe for creativity and storytelling, and as soon as the idea that [Spear] is trying to find life through death, that was it. That sealed the deal.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fokFA_vefjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Primal S1 Official Soundtrack | Full Album - Tyler Bates &amp; Joanne Higginbottom | WaterTower"></iframe></figure><p>Crafting a show that’s built on trusting its audience—especially in an era <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>when streaming’s binge model</u></a> leads to directives from on high for writers to craft dialogue where characters announce what they’re doing and why to keep viewers abreast while they drift back to their phones, a habit Genndy Tartakovsky admits he routinely scolds his daughter for—is its own evolutionary challenge. <em>Primal </em>wagers everything on the belief that viewers will follow its story through serene atmosphere, gnarly action, and evocative micro‑expressions alone. For a series anchored in intentionally minimalist dialogue of “unga‑bungas” and “graaawrs,” supported by a techno‑tribal score by <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1039873/genndy-tartakovsky-takes-an-unusual-approach-to-crafting-primals-score/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Tyler Bates and Joanne Higginbottom</a>, achieving clarity without compromise is a balancing act.&nbsp;</p><p>“The challenge of doing something like this is you can't rely on dialogue to tell the audience what is happening. You really gotta watch it, and sometimes when I'm doing the storyboard, [I] get lost in the abstraction, because I'm just doing drawings and these five drawings in a row are supposed to communicate an idea to you that's clear, without doubt,” he said. “If you're in the weeds too much, they become an abstraction, and you start tripping. Like, ‘Oh my god, nothing is making sense, I don't know what I'm doing. Are these five shots gonna make you feel that?’ That doubt is probably the hardest thing to get over.”</p><p>Fortunately, having tenure on cartoons like <em>Samurai Jack</em> makes telling stories without long stretches of dialogue a creative exercise Tartakovsky enjoys. Whenever his brain starts to overanalyze, he takes a little break, comes back, and powers through.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cwuJpZYJDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Spear Battles a Mutant Gorilla | Genndy Tartakovsky's Primal | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p>There are a few existing episodes Tartakovsky loves for different reasons. Episodes like “A Cold Death” are a reckoning for Spear and Fang, with someone’s death feeding someone’s life, as a herd of woolly mammoths hunts them down to avenge an elder whose pelt kept the pair warm in the harsh winter—a theme that’d serve as a big part of its first season. Or “Rage of the Ape-Men,” an episode so brutal yet so nice for how uncharacteristically peaceful it starts before diving into the worst brutality the show’s ever done by its climax. Or “Shadow of Fate,” which sees a complex love triangle of sorts where Fang finds a mate who wants to kill Spear, her “first familial love.” Still, all that effort can be lost if someone pulls out their phone, a&nbsp; scenario Tartakovsky says is even worse for an animator, who recounted a time when his daughter pulled out her phone while they were watching a movie together and things got “boring.”</p><p>“If she were watching <em>Primal</em>, she’d be lost for sure. But that’s the way people watch nowadays. They’ll get on their phone for a few minutes, and then come back to the movie, and it’s frustrating,” Tartakovsky said, noting how much work everyone from catering to lighting behind the scenes helped make live-action films work, only for audiences to flippantly dismiss it to look down at their phones.&nbsp;</p><p>“For animation, it’s even worse because we’re hand drawing everything so specifically,” he said. “But what can you do? It is what it is. My hope is that <em>Primal </em>means something at the end of the day, and it inspires people.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUSr2kEXLBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Genndy Tartakovsky’s The Black Knight Test Animation "></iframe></figure><p>Given Tartakovsky’s reputation as an elder statesman of modern animation—and the recent perception that decades-old passion projects like his infamously raunchy<em> Felix the Cat</em> flavored dog comedy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fixed-review-netflix-genndy-tartakovsky-idris-elba-kathryn-hahn-adam-devine?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fixed</u></em></a>,<em> </em>can get greenlit on the strength of his name alone—you’d assume he’s operating in a rarefied space where instinct alone can move mountains to get newer dream projects like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/genndy-tartakovsky-wants-help-getting-his-black-knight-film-made-2000664378?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Black Knight</u></em></a>, which he opted to<a href="https://gizmodo.com/genndy-tartakovsky-wont-give-up-on-getting-black-knight-made-2000667740?ref=aftermath.site"><u> release test footage of online to drum up hype</u></a> for a story he hopes to tell urgently tell in theaters. The animation sees a 14th century knight operating a 20-foot-tall black suit of armor “using ropes, pulleys, and levers” and a gigantic sword to fight a slender, (relatively) diminutive ninja armed with her kusarigama. Tldr: yet another effortless “dudes rock” premise. Tartakovsky hopes <em>Black Knight</em> can garner the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/genndy-tartakovsky-black-knight-test-footage-new-leak/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>same level of bombast </u></a>as<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-is-killer-with-some-filler-and-a-whole-lot-of-flashy-anime-action-2000657046?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Demon Slayer</u></em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kpop-demon-hunters-review-netflix-twice-2000614916?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>KPop Demon Hunters</u></em></a> have had in cinemas, but for Western animation. However, he’s quick to push back on the idea that his past accolades are enough to get works greenlit, especially if they’re original.</p><p>“My name is not enough. It’s not my reality where I walk into a room and go, ‘I wanna make this!’ and they go, ‘Yes, Genndy. Great!’ and we all cheer and hug each other. It’s still a business, and there’s still fear and doubt in something new.”</p><p>Although Tartakovsky has garnered enough faith and experience in the realm of TV that he could walk into a room and, at least, get a project in development pretty easily in comparison to his colleagues, the entertainment industry is a harder sell in the realm of original animated films.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I pitch <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> 4, 5, or 6, it’s easier to get greenlit because ‘Oh yeah, we get this. We know this. We know you’re responsible, so there’s no questions,’” Tartakovsky said in the tone of supposed producer execs. “When you do something different, then it’s, ‘Who’s this for? How much is this gonna cost?’ It’s not art first. It’s business first.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tartakovsky says it's especially complicated for bigwig business execs to greenlight original animated features, in part because studios are making fewer and fewer movies theatrically. In an era defined by legacy sequels and franchise building, Tartakovsky hopes the animation industry shifts to allow bold, original concepts to spearhead the media's direction in the next decade.</p><p>“I don’t want the world to be IP-driven with just twos and threes,” Tartakovsky said. “Before <em>Zootopia 2</em>, there was <em>Zootopia</em>. Before <em>Toy Story</em> one through five, there was one <em>Toy Story</em>. <em>Despicable Me</em>: all these things were original and inspired giant, multi-billion-dollar franchises. So why have we given up on those [originals]?”</p><p>If anything, Tartakovsky believes animation shouldn’t be chasing a new <em>Toy Story</em> or a new <em>SpongeBob </em>as another drop in its IP catalog for streaming, but as a new, original project that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the giants of the past. An instinct, Tartakovsky says, that seems to have disappeared in the industry, supplanted by the instinct <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nosferatu-frankenstein-robert-eggers-guillermo-del-toro-2000689468?ref=aftermath.site"><u>to take an old book or movie, redo it, and call it a day</u></a>.</p><p>“Personally, I want originals,” he said. “That’s what I like to see. It’s more interesting to me. If you have a good original, sure, of course I’ll go see a second one.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIqlw3VX_XU?list=PLcysDhWQHmuQH8BEjWo3yC1szOVGigKvG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Still, the first hurdle of getting an original animation geared toward adults off the ground is that to be successful, they should be violent, crass, or sensual. All of which dovetails to “the bigger question” that Tartakovsky’s eyes lit up when I asked whether he thinks studios don’t give audiences enough credit for being open to animation as an artform stigmatized as something exclusively for kids</p><p>“If you look at streaming adult animation and a normal network, it’s huge. From <em>The Simpsons </em>through <em>Rick and Morty</em>, <em>Primal</em>, and everything else. It’s very broad and successful. Fox has a whole block of adult animated cartoons so there’s a giant audience there. There’s a big, successful audience on Adult Swim, Hulu, and Netflix has a whole wing devoted to adult animation,” he said. “Then you go to features, there’s zero. Zero animated films are being made for that audience.”</p><p>He continued: “That’s the whole question with <em>Black Knight</em>: Where’s the audience? I would point to all of this success like a lot of comedy and action breaking through, but there is an audience. You go to <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>KPop Demon Hunter,</em> and that’s something different. There’s an audience, huge success.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrpYPoUhWmc?list=PLcysDhWQHmuQH8BEjWo3yC1szOVGigKvG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>For Tartakovsky, the argument is that while <em>Demon Slayer</em> is based on a TV show, it still has an audience coming out to theaters, which is a testament to the thirst for that kind of animation. And, should <em>Black Knight</em> make even half of its success for Sony Animation, it’s a shoo-in to be a success. But even if it doesn’t, an audience for animation of its ilk is there, and it’s growing every year, so it’s only a matter of time before a studio makes an original, commercial adult animated feature film that everyone will go see.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m trying to be the first to do that, and it’s difficult to be the first,” Tartakovsky said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everything is to try something new and have a different vibe. <em>Primal </em>is different than <em>Samurai Jack</em>, and <em>Black Knight</em> is trying to do its own thing. Creatively, it’s exciting, and it’s for a different audience that we’re trying to reach to see if that audience is even there on a big feature scale. That’s every project that I do but at this point in my career, I’m trying to do a different vibe. A different energy.”</p><p>Granted, like <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> creator Shinichirō Watanabe’s newest work, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shinichiro-watanabe-lazarus-interview-cowboy-bebop-2000584667?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Lazarus</u></em></a>, Tartakovsky acknowledged that <em>Primal </em>and <em>Black Knight</em>—while both endeavoring for their own vibes—harbor a resemblance in tone and energy that audiences will connect to his most well-known work, <em>Samurai Jack</em>, by proxy of it being of his. Still, he strives to make something different from the last thing he’s made.&nbsp;</p><p>“The last thing I want to do is 3 more seasons of <em>Primal </em>that’s exactly the same, with another idea,” Tartakovsky said, using aliens as an example of where that could’ve ramped up should he have stuck with making a story for the sake of making it.&nbsp;</p><p>And with <em>Black Knight</em> on the back burner (for now), Tartakovsky hopes <em>Primal</em>’s third season embodies his vision for what original animation can offer.&nbsp;</p><p>“Egotistically and selfishly, I hope <em>Primal </em>is a huge success, and it would prove you could do different stories and not have it necessarily be considered a cult, artistic experiment. It’s mainstream.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8l_o0VmHtBY?list=PLcysDhWQHmuQH8BEjWo3yC1szOVGigKvG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>While the show exists as the last of a dying breed of shows that anchor themselves on liminal dialogue, Tartakovsky likened <em>Primal </em>to what the television versions of action epics like <em>Sisu </em>and <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> offer viewers, a different experience that’s so unique any proponent for AI won’t have legs to stand on.&nbsp;</p><p>“The more unique that we can make things, the more it makes it anti-AI. It makes it AI-proof,” Tartakovsky said. “AI can copy, but can it create something truly original? We wanna push human creativity to a level where it can’t be copied. And that means doing original things, pushing boundaries, and trying different things. That’s where I hope it goes, and I hope <em>Primal </em>is a big part of that.”</p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals launched towards the very end of 2024 and kicked off 2025 as one of the most popular games of the year right off the top. It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">breaking records in December 2024</a>, and kept that momentum going in January 2025 with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">644K concurrent players and $135 million earned in gross revenue</a>.</p>



<p>To say that Marvel Rivals started off with a bang would be an understatement, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">it hasn't kept up the kinds of player concurrent numbers that see it go over half a million players on one platform alone</a>, at least on Steam, it has consistently stayed near or above 100K concurrent players, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">made multiple appearances</a> in Newzoo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">top ten games by monthly active users</a> throughout the year.</p>



<p>But all of that, according to producer Danny Koo, was "<em>just a warm-up</em>." Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/marvel-rivals-creators-on-leveling-up-the-game/">Den of Geek</a>, Koo said, "<em>2025 was more of a warm-up period for us</em>. <em>Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it</em>."</p>



<p>NetEase publishing and marketing lead, Yachen Bian, in the same interview added, "<em>In the next year, we want to provide more game modes</em>. <em>It’s why we have prototypes in the game, like PvE and 18v18. We want to give the players more choices of different game modes beyond the basic gameplay because your fundamental experience might be very different. When you’re fighting against zombies, it’s quite different from fighting against other people.</em>"</p>



<p>It's difficult to imagine what even more success looks like for Marvel Rivals, considering it was already one of 2025's most successful new games on the market, as it seems to have definitively carved out a place for itself in the highly competitive free-to-play shooter genre.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a lot of hard work and it always feels different and exciting</em>," Koo continued. "<em>This game is releasing new content every week. Even my own team comes in every day asking what's new today. Everyone's excited. They want to continue to make this happen. Everyone wants to make this the biggest game possible</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how NetEase continues to direct Marvel Rivals, and if it can sustain the engagement it enjoyed in the past year, and potentially even grow it further.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> had earned another Game of the Year award by the Indie Game Awards last week, but the organization has since announced that the award would be retracted because developer Sandfall Interactive used generative AI during development. The Indie Game Awards also rescinded the Debut Game award given to <em>Expedition 33</em>.</p><p>Here is the Indie Game Awards’ explanation, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">from an FAQ</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of a resurfaced interview with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-producer-confirms-generative-AI-use-in-Game-of-the-Year-winner.1187946.0.html">Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art</a> in production being brought to our attention on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination. While the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/">assets in question were patched out</a> and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Indie Game Awards’ Mike Towndrow also explained the decision in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/indiegameawards.gg/post/3magufzccy22i">a video on Bluesky</a>.</p><p>The Indie Game Awards’ criteria, as outlined in that FAQ, says that “Games developed using generative AI are strictly ineligible for nomination.” Sandfall Interactive didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Game of the Year is instead being awarded to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro">puzzle game <em>Blue Prince</em></a>. Publisher Raw Fury said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rawfury.bsky.social/post/3maivmd5kps2w">on Sunday</a> that “there is no AI used in Blue Prince” and that the game “was built and crafted with full human instinct” by Tonda Ros and the Dogubomb team.</p><p>“As gen AI becomes more prevalent in our industry, we will better navigate it appropriately,” the Indie Game Awards says.</p><p>The Indie Game Awards is also retracting an Indie Vanguard award from studio Gortyn Code, which developed the Game Boy-inspired game <em>Chantey</em>. The game is sold on a physical cartridge by Palmer Luckey’s ModRetro, which makes the Chromatic Game Boy. Luckey also founded defense contractor Anduril, and Chromatic recently announced an Anduril-branded Chromatic made from “the same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones.”</p><p>“The IGAs nomination committee were unfortunately made aware of ModRetro’s nature and principles the day after the 2025 premiere with the news of their upcoming handheld console,” the Indie Game Awards says. Because of <em>Chantey’s</em> ties with ModRetro, “Indie Vanguard has also been retracted as we do not want to provide the company with a platform.” The organization also says that “The decision does not reflect Gortyn Code, but ModRetro alone.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/849144/indie-game-awards-game-of-the-year-expedition-33-generative-ai-chantey-modretro]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Goodness gracious, 2025 has been a fantastic year for video games, and most excitingly, for games of all scales and budgets. Big-name releases have hit the spot, while indies have sprung from nowhere to become breakthrough hits, such that wrestling them all down to a top 10 with which I’m happy has been an ordeal. But I got there, and I’m happy with it. I’ve also rather shocked myself by putting two big-name games in the top two spots, thus losing my cool indie credentials. Thankfully the rest of the list makes up for it.</p> <p>My technique for putting these lists together is to read every other site’s top charts, getting angry with the generic crap that’s getting overly lauded, and then scroll through the <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-horrifying-just-how-little-time-steam-users-spend-playing-new-games-2000654158">183 new games</a> I played this year on PC alone. Then I pick the 10 which are objectively the best ones, and rank them in a scientifically proven and unquestionable order of goodnessosity, for an irrefutable list on which history is established.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>10) Eclipsium</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655149">© Housefire</figcaption></figure> <p>I installed&nbsp;<em>Eclipsium</em> on the basis of the screenshots, and <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/10/eclipsium/">am so glad I did</a>. I’m so pleased to see the game got some attention from others too, with the extraordinary art in this walking-sim horror game astonishing everyone who saw it. This is a peculiar and striking game, combining truly beautiful vistas and horrendous body horror, and it’s so damned interesting. Every surface ripples with pixels, such that the world is only truly tangible when you’re moving, giving everything an organic feeling of <em>breathing</em>. It’s a 3D game that’s then re-rendered onto a 320×180 canvas, with a 12FPS human hand added as your means of interaction with the world. The effect is extraordinary, ensuring an already intriguing and surreal experience is all the more compelling.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>9) The Drifter</strong></h2> <p><span>© Powerhoof / Kotaku</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-drifter-point-and-click-adventure-powerhoof-review-1851786671"><em>The Drifter</em></a> starts out looking like a traditional point-and-click adventure, before revealing two super-important things: Firstly, an immediately fascinating story that <em>might be</em> about some peculiar secret forces causing the disappearance of homeless people, and secondly, a control scheme for old-school adventures that makes so much sense in the modern world. Its innovative design for controllers needs to be copied by absolutely everyone else out there, forever.</p>

 <p>The game then divides itself into distinct chapters, with a limited number of locations available in each, to keep the developing story moving along nicely. I’m not a big fan of the ending, but what makes&nbsp;<em>The Drifter</em> stand out is that this doesn’t feel like it matters as much as it normally might in a narrative game. It’s still great fun, and everything that comes before the conclusion is so thrilling. Plus there’s fabulous voice acting, gorgeous art, and some really neat puzzles.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>8) MotionRec</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655153">© Hansum / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s the conceit of 2D platform-puzzler <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/11/motionrec/"><em>MotionRec</em></a>: You can record your movement for a short while, and then “replay” that motion elsewhere in a level irrespective of the platforms available. So let’s say you need to get to a distant point at the top right, and there’s just a void before you. Record yourself climbing a flight of steps from bottom left to top right elsewhere, then replay it here. The further you go, the more superbly elaborate this all becomes, until you’re solving puzzles that would have absolutely flummoxed you near the start.</p>

 <p>The game pretends to be 15 levels long, but the truth is it’s 30, and that’s good to know before you play. There’s something psychologically unsettling about thinking you’re winding down to an end, only to learn you’re only halfway through, and it’s far more pleasant to work through with the knowledge. Also, that second half is wildly more difficult than the first, meaning it’ll take you an awful lot longer to figure out. The game is so clever, and the sparing pixel art amazingly well used, making&nbsp;<em>MotionRec</em> my favorite in a very strong field of puzzle games in 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>7) Escape from Duckov</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655160" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655160"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655160">© Team Soda</figcaption></figure> <p>I was pretty sure&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> was a goof. You know how Steam’s charts get clogged up with those god-awful achievement farms, “games” like&nbsp;<em>Banana</em> suddenly seeing hundreds of thousands of simultaneous players, despite being borderline nothingness? I thought, from the name and its sudden popularity, that this was one of those. Nope! So is it a simple spoof? An <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> knock-off but with duck skins? No, it’s that either! It turns out this single-player extraction shooter from a team of five <a href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-ps5-save-bug-crash-patch-update-1851781990">is a superb game in its own right</a>, a compelling loop of outside runs of derring-do, and base-building with the loot you gathered. It’s a twin-stick isometric shooter at heart, with vast locations to explore and quests that encourage you to venture ever-further away from safety, always carrying the grim risk of losing everything. So, an extraction shooter. But with ducks. And no other stinky, horrible players to ruin your day. I ended up spending far longer with this game than I ever thought I would, and just writing about it now is making me itch to switch back from <em>Arc Raiders</em> for my adrenaline fix.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>6) Old Skies</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655168">© Wadjet Eye / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It took me a little longer to warm up to&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em> than I did to Wadjet Eye’s previous stunning adventure, <em>Unavowed</em>. But warm up I did, until I was <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-skies-wadjet-eye-adventure-pc-steam-unavowed-1851777432">singing from the rooftops</a> about this wonderful point-and-click tale of time travel tourism. You play as Fia Quinn, a “time agent” who accompanies the rich on their travels back to moments in the past to ensure they don’t attempt to change anything important in history. Told in chapters, Quinn’s tale eventually begins to weave an over-arching narrative as various events begin to interconnect.</p> <p>Something I particularly loved about&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em>, apart from its fantastic writing, acting and art, is that it&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> obsessed with the butterfly effect, or an obsessive preservation of history. Instead, this is a future where events are <em>constantly</em> being altered by the actions of those visiting the past, with only certain key events preserved as unchangeable. And one of those is 9/11, allowing long-time New Yorker Dave Gilbert to revisit his own experiences of that day in a way that’s effective and affecting, without ever being intrusive or ghoulish. It’s a time travel story like you’ve never heard before, and a splendid adventure game to boot.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>5) Strange Antiquities</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655169">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I completely missed&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em> in 2022. An odd aspect of my job is that if an indie game is already getting lots of mainstream attention, it becomes a far lower priority for me to play so I can focus on the completely unknown and try to get more eyes their way instead. And what a shame, because what a game! However, when commissioned to write an interview with the developers of the sequel, I quickly put that right and played the original before this year’s second game. And what a treat that was!</p> <p>Both games have you working in a small shop, selling plants in the original, obscure items here, to a range of customers, but nothing in your store is labelled and you must identify them through interacting with a huge range of clues. And wow, what a far greater range there is in <em>Antiquities </em>than its predecessor, with its wonderful spread of ways to interact with items, the piles of pamphlets and letters, its multiple maps with locations to explore (in text adventure format), and secret compartments to discover. It’s a breathtakingly smart game, endlessly delightful in the ingenuity of the challenges, and it comes with a hint system that goes well out of its way to get you past a block without spoiling anything.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>4) Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655174"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655174">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve gotta admit, I was a bit deflated after I bought my Switch 2.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> felt like such an anticlimax to me, a game that didn’t seem significantly more interesting than previous entries, and with an open-world I was so excited to explore, and so disappointed to experience. It was, oddly enough, replaying&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> on the device that won me over—the doors finally opened the moment you shot them! And then along came&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza.</em></p> <p>Look, you can hate me as much as you want, but I never really got on with the old <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>games. I KNOW. I’m wrong. I’m not denying it. But it rather flattened my excitement for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 game of 2025. So what a happy boy I was once I started playing! Oh my goodness, this is what I like to pretend represents Nintendo, rather than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">spiteful, lawyer-forward</a> corporation it too often reveals itself to be: a giant box of joyful fun. It’s a game that just wants to be played, to be thoroughly enjoyed as much as is humanly possible, uninterested in pushing you away or restricting your options for distractions. I deliberately played&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em> as slowly as I could, going back and seeking out every last banana on every level once I realized I was getting close to the end, because I didn’t want it to be over. It’s rare that games are this much pure fun.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>3) The Beekeeper’s Picnic</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655192">© Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Did I really enjoy&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/04/the-beekeepers-picnic/"><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em></a> more than&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>? Well, the question itself reveals the complete stupidity of ranking such lists at all. This is, really, ten games I really enjoyed in 2025, and I’ve ranked them based on incoherent vibes. It’s almost as silly to compare a manic 3D action game about smashing rocks to a genteel 2D story about an elderly Sherlock Holmes as it is to compare it to a favorite fruit or particularly enjoyable train ride. They are utterly dissimilar, and both completely wonderful.</p>

 <p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is a love letter. It’s a love letter to the entire canon of Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, a love letter to classic point-and-click adventures,&nbsp;<em>and</em> a love letter in and of itself. This is a game about a post-Great War Sherlock Holmes re-retiring to Sussex and confronting himself over his lifelong treatment of his closest friend, John Watson. As Watson returns from the front lines, where the old man returned to the army as a medic, Holmes delightedly welcomes him into his new countryside cottage, and wants to show his affection for the doctor by putting together a picnic. That’s the setup, and it’s gorgeous.</p> <p>Even better, creator Helen Greetham is a devoted fan of the Holmes stories, and understands them in a way that almost every recent Sherlock-based media has not. It begins with a scene set toward the end of&nbsp;<em>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</em>, to establish Doyle’s own representation of the love between these two men, before moving to 1918 to tell a new story set after any in the official series. To present a softened Holmes, a man finally able to be reflective and introspective instead of simply an objective detective, is so brave, and could so easily have come across as disingenuous. But Greetham’s deep knowledge and respect for the character ensures it always feels utterly valid. I adored it. I find myself thinking about it. I have <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762">so much more to say about it</a> than I do most other games I played this year. Yeah, you know what, I think I&nbsp;<em>did</em> enjoy it more than&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>2) Arc Raiders</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655179">© Embark Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I was not expecting to like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>. I was, in fact, not the least bit interested in playing <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Online games in which I have to interact with other players are my kryptonite, and on learning that there was no PvE mode, I didn’t even want to bother. But then I kept reading <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198">Claire’s</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">articles</a> on <em>Kotaku</em> about how much fun she was having, and I dunno…she convinced me to try. I’m so glad.</p> <p>Even after this, it didn’t seem likely I’d stick with it. I messaged a friend to say, “I’m going to try playing&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders.</em>” His reply: “I can’t think you’ll enjoy it.” A month later, I’m hooked.</p>

 <p>As I’ve previously documented, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">I’m pretty dreadful at the game</a>, although I am improving. I haven’t died for so long now that the next failure is going to hurt like&nbsp;<em>hell</em>, genuinely to the point where I find myself a little reluctant to try sometimes. Then I see a quest I’m sure I can do, moderate what I’m willing to take with me, and get out there. Although I&nbsp;<em>have</em> given up playing on Xbox until I next die, since I’m significantly more comfortable with a mouse and keyboard.</p> <p>I’m not sure I’d ever have found my way into this if I’d not played&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> first, but now I’m totally all in on solo-able extraction shooters. (Never, ever going to play in a team, ever, not never.) I love the world Embark has built. I love the stunning graphics, especially the game’s <em>air</em>, which is a mad thing to be excited about but it keeps taking me aback. I love the utter terror of creeping around buildings, of spamming, “Don’t shoot!” if I see another player, or delightedly responding with an “OK!” if someone else says it first. I love&nbsp;<em>just</em> making it into an elevator with nothing to spare. God <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-sliding-steps-embark-studios-2000650065">I love sliding down the stairs</a>. I still haven’t found enough fucking lemons to upgrade my chicken, and I love that this is a sentence I’m typing.</p>

 <p>I’m having so much fun playing a game I thought was absolutely not for me, in a genre I didn’t think I’d ever care about, and that’s a truly spectacular thing. Now, all they need to do is <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">replace the sodding AI voices</a> and I can stop feeling guilty about it, too.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>1) Avowed</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655186"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655186">© Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>January and February games do have a habit of slipping out of end of year lists, so it’s testament to Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em> that it hasn’t left my mind since I finished it. What a big, beautiful RPG, unquestionably the best of 2025, with companions that feel like old friends, characters I find myself wondering about, and massive world-changing choices of significant consequence.&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is up there with my all-time favorites,&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em> and&nbsp;<em>Planescape Torment</em>, a game I cannot wait to return to when it’s been long enough that I’ve forgotten the finer details.</p>

 <p>Oh, and it’s a third game in the world of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, one of the finest RPG series gaming has to offer.&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>‘s use of the setting offers huge amounts to faithful fans, while remaining completely accessible to anyone visiting for the first time. That’s thanks to the Living Lands being a unique setting in the realm of Eora, such that it sits distinct from the <em>Pillars</em> tales of untrustworthy gods, while still in a world reeling from their revelations.</p> <p>Kai is an all-time great RPG companion, and it bewilders me that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avowed">Wikipedia page for&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em></a> still lists that there’s no companion romance in the game. It’s not just that it’s the same voice actor as Garrus; I love him like I love Garrus, and I feel like I miss him since we stopped hanging around.</p> <p>The setting is an all-time great RPG land, with its disparate biomes keeping things fresh, and the parkour-ish climbing and jumping adds a verticality that RPGs rarely see. But, of course, more than anything else it’s about experiencing a story in the company of brilliant characters, which no one else does quite like Obsidian. (No, not even Larian, although I have no shade for the incredible&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.)</p> <p>Thinking back on&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> doesn’t feel like remembering a video game I played this year, but more like reflecting on a place I inhabited, the people I knew there, and the adventures we had. That’s truly special, and it’s why&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is very definitely my game of 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2> <p>I have&nbsp;<em>so</em> many other games I loved this year, and I’m going to have forgotten to mention loads of them, and perhaps even one I’d have put in the top 10 if I remembered. But those I&nbsp;<em>can</em> remember to call out are:</p> <ul> <li><em>Dawnfolk</em></li> <li><em>Slender Threads</em></li> <li><em>Wizordum</em></li> <li><em>Crashlands 2</em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></li> <li><em>Ooo</em></li> <li><em>Project Warlock II</em></li> <li><em>The Supper: New Blood</em></li> <li><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></li> <li><em>Strange Jigsaws</em></li> <li><em>Time Flies</em></li> <li><em>Gigasword</em></li> <li><em>The Crazy Hyper Dungeon Chronicles</em></li> </ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Details On Romero Games’ Xbox Title]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/details-on-romero-games-xbox-title/</link>
            <guid>1390411</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Microsoft and Xbox held its wave of mass layoffs in July, one studio that was impacted in a major way Romero Games. Founded by the creator of Doom and founder of Id Software, John Romero, Romero Games had a publisher agreement with Xbox on a new title.</p>



<p>That agreement was ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled over the summer</a>, with the future of Romero Games left up in the air. At one point there were even rumors of the studio being shut down due to the funding being pulled, but that was denied and Romero Games moved forward.</p>







<p>Fast-forward to December, and Romero confirmed that not only is the studio moving forward, but it’s working on a new game. But what about the game that was in development. Up until now, information has been scarce. However, Insider Gaming has learned a few details about what the game was.</p>



<p>As first reported on Episode 44 of Insider Gaming Weekly, the game was known as “Hellslayer” and centered around the idea of a priest fighting demons. It was also set to be a first-person shooter that had inspiration from games like Hotline Miami in the sense that if you die, you would instantly restart the area. Sources say that it was a game that had been in the works for nearly a decade, but has been ended in its current state to move forward with a new project.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The new game is a “completely redesigned” title that takes elements from the original game. At a panel in early December, Romero said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/john-romeros-canceled-game-has-been-saved-sort-of/">new project wasn’t being started</a> from scratch, but it will still be a “different game” than what was first planned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned of some of those features, but to protect the source, can’t divulge them publicly at this time. Romero said that the new game was something he never played before, but if you were a fan of the older Id Software titles, you’ll likely enjoy many of the features of the new title if and when it’s finally revealed to the world.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-working-nintendo-improve-vrr-all-switch-2-games/</link>
            <guid>1390354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has had a close relationship with <strong>Nintendo</strong> for a long time. It was one of the few third-party developers to happily support the original Nintendo Switch from the get-go, and it even partnered with them to create the oddball but quite well-received XCOM-inspired crossover game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a></strong> (2017) and its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-funs-out-guns-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Sparks of Hope</strong></a> (2022).</p>



<p>This collaboration continued with the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> this year as Ubisoft successfully ported its most technologically advanced games, Massive's <strong>Star Wars: Outlaws</strong> and Ubisoft Toronto's <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows</strong>, to the new hybrid console.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a>, the latter game, which launched earlier this month on Nintendo Switch 2, also includes a dedicated algorithm for <strong>VRR (Variable Refresh Rate)</strong> that manages to keep the feature enabled even at the game's locked frame rate of 30 FPS, despite the hardware only technically allowing that for 40 FPS and above. </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/ubisoft-is-working-with-nintendo-to-improve-vrr-support-on-nintendo-switch-2-to-bring-better-fluidity-to-lower-framerate-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to FRVR</a>, Ubisoft revealed how it works:</p>



<p><em>Both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars: Outlaws use a similar technique to take advantage of Switch 2’s Variable Refresh Rate, even below 40Hz. Since Shadows targets 30fps, and the console’s VRR currently only works at 40Hz or higher, we use a clever workaround. The same frame is effectively presented twice, once in the middle of the frame and again at the end, so the hardware outputs at a 60Hz interval while maintaining smooth visuals</em>.</p>



<p>Even more interesting is the fact that Ubisoft said it is working with Nintendo to potentially apply this custom algorithm system-wide. If that option was actually implemented, it could benefit all Nintendo Switch 2 games, offering a smoother experience in handheld mode. Sadly, the interview does not specify any timeframe, so we don't know yet when it could arrive. </p>



<p>At the very least, Ubisoft has added that it is now a standard feature of the Anvil Engine, so it will be found in future games powered by the proprietary technology. The first one to release could be the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the latest rumor</a>, could be launched as early as mid-January 2026. Anvil should also <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appear again in March 2026</a> for the rumored debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Resynced</a>, the remake of the 2013 game.</p>

            <guid>1390348</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Timothée Chalamet is one of the biggest actors around right now after starring in hit movies like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Wonka</em>. But before that, he was just a teenager on YouTube trying to get big by modding and painting Xbox 360 controllers. And the director behind his upcoming film, <em>Marty Supreme,</em> wanted the 29-year-old actor to tap into that part of his life while filming.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Arriving in theaters nationwide on Christmas, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9gSuKaKcqM"><em>Marty Supreme</em></a> stars Chalamet as Marty Mauser, a young and scrappy wannabe table tennis pro who works hard, deals with plenty of naysayers, and pushes through various obstacles on his mission to turn his passion into a career. To help Chalamet properly portray Mauser, who is loosely based on a real table tennis pro,<em> Marty Supreme</em> director and co-writer Josh Safdie told the young actor to remember his days making YouTube videos about gamepads.</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">“[Director] Josh [Safdie] wanted me to tap into, you know, he was always talking about, like, I modded controllers on YouTube growing up,” <a href="https://youtu.be/NhMqMdu6Wlc?t=757">Chalamet told the <em>BBC</em> in a recent interview.</a> “He’s like that part of you. He’s like the hustler part of you. The swaggerful part of you.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">And yeah, in case this is news to you: <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-s-timothee-chalamet-was-once-an-xbox-youtuber-1847946368">Chalamet used to have a small YouTube channel back in 2010</a> where he uploaded a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab835/is-this-timothee-chalamets-xbox-modding-youtube-channel-an-investigation?utm_source=VICE_Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social+">few short videos of himself showing off modded and customized Xbox 360 controllers</a>. The channel was aptly titled ModdedController360, and in 2021, Chalamet admitted to running the channel, which has since sadly been removed from YouTube. Thankfully, people have saved some of the videos, like this one of Chalamet, who never reveals his face, showing off a “sexy” red tiger paint job.</p>

  <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Here’s what Chalamet had to say about the channel <a href="https://youtu.be/Xv5l-hisFuA?t=486">back in 2021</a>, when he revealed he was the one behind it: “I had a YouTube channel people found. It’s YouTube dot com back-slash ‘ModdedController360.’ And I used to paint-mod controllers, I did three, and I spray-painted them and…opened them up, and I would charge people $10.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">According to the actor, it didn’t take off, though he made $30 off three clients.&nbsp;If you own one of those controllers, I bet it’s worth a lot more than $10 in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/22/ark-2-is-now-targeting-a-2028-launch</link>
            <guid>1390345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-awaited <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/ark-ii-announced-featuring-vin-diesel">Ark 2 was announced in 2020</a>, and after a lengthy wait with minimal updates and a few delays, it finally has a new release window. Unfortunately, it’s still a few years away, but we now have a better idea as to why and what to expect from the upcoming sequel.</p><p>In an <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">interview with Epic Games’ Brian Crecente</a>, Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz confirmed that Ark 2 is now planned to launch in 2028. This was revealed during publisher Snail Games’ Investor Day. He also explains the studio’s approach to releasing Ark 2, and how it wants to incorporate the lessons learned from releasing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2023/10/25/check-out-the-dinosaurs-in-ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the current and remastered iteration of the original Ark: Survival Evolved.</p><p>“One of the things about doing Ark 2 was that we felt we had to learn a lot more about how to make the kind of game we wanted to do, and to do it kind of in phases,” Stieglitz explains. “Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called Ark 2.”</p><p>To do this, Studio Wildcard is planning to use Ark: Survival Ascended, which has now surpassed 4 million units sold, to gradually prepare for Ark 2’s launch. The first taste of the sequel will come in an expansion called Legacy of Santiago, arriving in late 2027. This expansion will feature mechanics and features planned for the 2028 sequel and serves as a prequel that will help set the stage for Ark 2’s events – Santiago is, after all, Ark 2’s protagonist, portrayed by Vin Diesel.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8KbXpk2J9Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8KbXpk2J9Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Legacy of Santiago will allow us to explore a lot of mechanics that we want to do with Ark 2, but it kind of derisks that, " says Stieglitz. “Essentially, if we don't do it right, if we don't do it perfectly, we're able to iterate on it with a live game and get a lot more feedback than to just release something standalone. It's much safer for us to get a lot of that feedback in a live game where we can react much more fluidly to what players are telling us.”</p><p>In terms of Vin Diesel’s role in Ark 2, Stieglitz says his total involvement is still “an open question” that will determine the full scope of ambition of the game’s plot. &nbsp;</p><p>“The question is: How much performance are we going to get from him?” Stieglitz said. “Are we going to get one day, five days, eight hours? You don’t know. And the scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do.”</p><p>Stieglitz also explains that Studio Wildcard wants to ensure players are ready to leave the previous game behind before launching Ark 2; it doesn’t want to stop updating Ark: Survival Ascended and leave those players in the cold. Thus, it is implementing a robust content roadmap throughout 2026 and 2027. This includes new narrative expansion Ark: Lost Colony launching this week, and 2026 additions such as the esports-focused Ark: Survival of the Fittest, a pirate-themed expansion called Bob’s True Tales: Tides of Fortune, and a modding-focused update called Ark World Creator. Even when Ark 2 launches, Stieglitz states that Ark: Survival Ascended will continue to be updated as long as demand exists.</p><p>Ark 2 was announced during The Game Awards in 2020&nbsp;with a 2023 launch window. The game was delayed to 2024, with Studio Wildcard releasing Ark: Survival Ascended in 2023 instead. Obviously, Ark 2 would miss this 2024 launch window, and is now slated to arrive eight years after its reveal, assuming everything (hopefully) goes as planned.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/22/ark-2-is-now-targeting-a-2028-launch]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="1f104f3b2e595"><a title="Clair Obscur" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f104f3b2e595/clair-obscur.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Kepler Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What a week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, comments from Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke to Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) created headlines we've grown all too used to over the last couple of years. Following the reveal of a new <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/divinity">Divinity</a></strong> game at The Game Awards, Vincke said that the studio was actively using generative AI for concept art generation and placeholder text.</p>
<p>He clarified that nothing in the final game would be the product of genAI and that <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833">concept artists weren't being replaced</a>, but for many, the damage was done, the online backlash swift.</p>
<p>In the interview, Vincke said that people at the company are "more or less OK with the way we’re using it," and, as made explicit in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ma5dqbmgm22o">the transcribed text later shared</a>, the CEO also admits, "I don't actually think it accelerates things." Which begs the question (which Schreier posed): <em>If it's not improving efficiency, why use it?</em></p>
<p>The reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a tech driven industry, so you try stuff. You can't afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you're not using it, you're dead in this industry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has attracted enormous investment since ChatGPT took off, and a brand of breathless investor spin to make non-fungible token-shilling crypto bros weep.</p>
<p>Unlike NFTs, though, AI in its various forms is nigh-on impossible to ignore or escape. You can't open your emails without Google offering to summarise or Copilot wanting to write replies. Search results turn up AI overviews by default. Old photos are being colourised or 'cleaned up', or straight-up fabricated, and shown alongside real images.</p>

<p>When it comes to big corporations in the business of producing media, interactive or not, Disney is on board now, to the tune of <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-openai-sora-agreement/">$1 billion of equity investment</a> in OpenAI's Sora, and you'll soon see those videos popping up on Disney+. The corporation also greenlit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s AI-generated Darth Vader voice, which led to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fortnite-turns-to-the-dark-side-with-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-of-course-its-been-swearing">the obvious</a> and an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fortnite-devs-hit-with-unfair-labour-practice-filing-following-ai-darth-vader-fiasco">angry SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube is increasingly filled with genAI material ranging from simple thumbnails to entire videos. And to bring it back to games, a trip to the Switch eShop shows piles of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/search/#cat=gme&amp;f=softwarePublisher&amp;softwarePublisher=Aldora%20Games">AI-generated pap</a> riffing on whatever trends and IP are in the charts.</p>
<p>Like it or not, AI is in your face, in your feeds, and in your thoughts if you're a creative in any field.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:195431 @ 1766434440 -->
<p>It's probably worth noting that the AI we're discussing here isn't the human-programmed responses and rudimentary pathfinding that's been guiding CPU bots in deathmatches for decades. Generative AI has been trained on samples and can generate results — images, audio, words, code, and more — according to its specific function. And Larian is very far from alone when it comes to experimenting with the emerging tech.</p>
<p>Having given up on <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/square-enix-will-end-symbiogenesis-nft-project-shares-final-roadmap/">its NFT game</a>, Square Enix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-aims-to-automate-70percent-of-qa-with-generative-ai-by-2027">has goals</a> to automate 70% of its quality assurance with genAI by 2027. Sega is looking to leverage it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/sega-will-carefully-assess-appropriate-use-cases-when-it-comes-to-leveraging-ai">where "appropriate"</a>. Falcom has been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nihon-falcom-actively-using-ai-for-brainstorming-scenarios-conducting-research-and-similar-applications.1386748/">using it for brainstorming</a>. As significant investors in OpenAI, it's no surprise that Microsoft loves it (although <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/05/xbox-developer-insists-generative-ai-is-not-mandated-at-microsoft">apparently does not mandate its use</a>).</p>
<figure data-uuid="e9f02a8c89f51"><a title="Black Ops 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e9f02a8c89f51/black-ops-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Xbox Game Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using — or admitting to using — AI tools for generating in-game art assets was a line that many were unwilling to cross until fairly recently, though. Now we're beginning to see more than the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Microsoft-owned Activision is probably the largest to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-responds-to-complaints-of-ai-generated-assets-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">acknowledge its use</a> in generating multiplayer Prestige icons. Whether that is a factor in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Black Ops 7</a>'s <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/black-ops-7-sales-and-players-down-massively-on-last-years-call-of-duty-new-data-shows">underwhelming sales performance</a> is unclear (it seems unlikely), but the tech certainly hasn't hurt <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/arc_raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, which has been a massive success for Embark Studios despite <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/as-arc-raiders-takes-off-developer-embark-defends-its-use-of-ai-tools">drawing ire</a> with its use of AI-generated text-to-speech voices.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was employed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">blurred, distorted images</a> in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. 11 Bit Studios' <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/"><strong>The Alters</strong> used AI</a> for placeholder text and some quick translations. The multi-award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> <a href="https://playingthisweek.substack.com/p/why-i-no-longer-cheer-for-clair-obscur">used it for some assets</a> (before they were patched out), which has led to the Indie Game Awards retracting its GOTY and Debut Game awards over the weekend due to a "hard stance on the use of gen AI" as per <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">the IGA's regulations</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested — and you should be — <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/list-of-games-that-use-generative-ai.1367848/">Resetera members</a> are compiling <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nVevq_bW5ZnC8jUiBvB-Rh1wKbAoc3mShY8ALCi9hY/edit?gid=0#gid=0">a spreadsheet</a> listing games where genAI usage has been confirmed. It's turning up in games of all sizes, from teams reputable and otherwise.</p>
<p>Most big companies, though, are still hedging their bets and waiting for the dust to settle, unwilling to risk their reputation and workforces on the new hotness and implement tech that could still create a catastrophic mess in an uncertain legal environment</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:191392 @ 1766434440 -->
<p>Another thing that's unclear right now is whether enough players are genuinely troubled by the direction genAI is taking the industry. AI-fabricated images and videos from prompts may fool a casual glance, but if a game's artistic integrity is obviously being compromised and cheapened by uncanny textures and character portraits with 17 fingers, you'd imagine there will be complaints. AI-generated code running beneath it, though? How would the end user even identify that?</p>
<p>Even aspects that don't seem <em>quite</em> right could be the result of some good old-fashioned jank or human error. Is that odd dialogue text or flat-sounding performance an artistic choice? A sub-par localisation? A weird line read that the VO director missed? As the tech improves, it will get tougher to tell.</p>
<p>For many industry creatives, the answer to the genAI question is self-evident. What are you left with if you cut the artist out of the art?</p>

<p>For <em>players</em>, though — especially those who don't keep up with the industry's ins and outs — it's less clear-cut.</p>
<p>Jacob Navek, a former director of bizdev at Square Enix and current CEO of Genvid Technologies, suggests (unsurprisingly) that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/consumers-generally-do-not-care-about-ai-in-games-says-former-square-enix-exec">"consumers generally do not care"</a> about AI in games. Looking at the aforementioned ARC Raiders, which sold more than four million copies in two weeks, there seem to be enough players who either don't know or don't care about the controversy - as long as the game's good.</p>
<p>As he's wont to do, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/11/epic-games-ceo-comments-on-arc-raiders-and-its-use-of-ai-voice-generation">Epic's Tim Sweeney</a> weighed in on the subject of Embark's game, claiming that the increased productivity of AI "leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people". Nexon (Embark's parent company) CEO Junghun Lee <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">told Automaton</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's important to assume every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some real race-to-the-bottom energy there, with a dash of anxiety akin to Swen Vincke's golden egg comment. But if we assume that AI usage <em>is</em> as widespread as Lee suggests, the real question, again, is whether players really mind if a game uses genAI. Or, more specifically: Do <em>enough</em> players care about it to give companies pause?</p>
<p>It's an inflammatory subject online, that's for sure, as evidenced most recently (well, probably not by the time this goes live) by the activity surrounding <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-indie-game-awards-clair-obscur/">The Escapist's article and subsequent apology</a> following accusations that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> dev Dogubomb had used genAI, prompting <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/2002748999388844330">a response</a> from publisher Raw Fury. The echo chambers of social media and gaming forums naturally amplify the outrage, and we're now starting to see devs targeted with unfounded accusations from aggrieved parties, too. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/rpg-dev-pushes-back-against-steam-review-ai-accusations-we-poured-years-of-our-lives-into-this-game-and-only-worked-with-real-human-artists-on-everything/">It's getting ugly out there.</a></p>

<p>As a writer for a games outlet, AI is the latest existential nightmare to ensh*tify the internet and stretch the economics of games media to breaking point. All those necessary SEO evils you spent years living with and working around? They've been usurped by a fresh hell which consumes your every word — and your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/01/artificial-intelligence-em-dashes-ai-stealing-my-livelihood">em dashes</a> — for itself. No, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/franzferdinand2.bsky.social/post/3lyeu7wkfzk2w">absolutely not</a>.</p>
<p>Vincke's suggestion that AI helps with idea generation ('ideation', a word which I struggle to even type) but simultaneously <em>doesn't</em> speed up the process feels like the confused take of a CEO fearfully reframing tech he surely knows torches the respect of anyone with an appreciation of art versus 'content' (another term that induces <a href="https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN3kza2lqcXY1eHIwNWthMmp2NzZpOTJobGU1MnBqc2htY2xldHo0cSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/e4Jyxh9zQjgnC/giphy.gif">Eastwood shudders</a>).</p>
<p><em>It's useful for inspiration - ideation for the human-crafted content!</em> Is it, though? Really?</p>

<p>Given the dubious quality of the 'inspiration', it doesn't take long to realise the bubble <em>will</em> burst. And knowing what the landscape will look like afterwards — when there's no mice left for the snake that gorged on its own tail — is perhaps the biggest unknown.</p>
<p>Personally, the idea of AI planning my free time, summarising and responding to my emails, speaking to my staff, and writing my words is abhorrently unappealing. As a transcription tool for a long interview, sure, but the moment it starts making suggestions, offering 'inspiration', or generating anything, any self-respecting creator should reject with extreme prejudice.</p>

<p>Even beyond purely creative fields, outsourcing connection — taking the human out of human resources or any interaction that depends on communication — feels like a fundamental failure and misunderstanding of how we interact as a species, let alone what sparks imagination and joy. It's an affront that will lead to confusion, burnout, productivity ruin, and a thick sludge of product that the algorithm insists you really should like. My worry is that the killjoys claiming everything was better in the past will one day be right.</p>
<p>A tad dramatic? Perhaps, but given the state of things, you'll forgive my heightened alert. We try not to flood the site with AI controversy because, frankly, it's a massive downer - but it is a huge issue facing the games industry, so I'm interested to get a temperature check from people who love games but aren't professionally obliged to follow the ins and outs.</p>
<p>Do you worry about AI and its effect on the industry? Are you satisfied with genned-up overviews, even if they contain factual errors? Do you really care if developers use genAI in their games? Let us know in the polls below if you're genuinely bothered by the biggest and best studios using AI during development, and if there's a difference in your mind in how it's employed.</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Apologies, that's all a bit rambling. AI could have tightened it up, no doubt, and nuked those typos I missed despite rereading it two, three, ten times. What can I say? Last week was a long one.</em></p>

            <guid>1390324</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">one of the most winning-est games in the history of the industry</a>, with multiple Game of the Year wins under its belt on top of awards for several other major categories. Though it now has one less win on its mantle, with the Indie Game Awards, an annual awards show that specifically highlights indie games in the industry, stripping Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its Game of the Year win over the fact that Sandfall Interactive used GenAI (generative AI) technology in the game's development.</p>



<p>Now, if you're a regular Wccftech reader, then you'd know that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 launched with what were seemingly meant to be temporary, AI-generated assets, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">as we've brought it up</a> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">multiple articles</a>. But no one would blame you for not knowing, particularly because the only time Sandfall Interactive admitted to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html">using GenAI was in an interview with Spanish publication El País this past July</a>.</p>



<p>As to how it got through the IGAs' nominations round and, eventually, to initially winning in two categories, both Debut Game and Game of the Year, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">an FAQ on the IGAs website reads</a>, "<em>When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em>"</p>



<p>Upon learning that was not the case, with the article from July resurfacing and Sandfall Interactive finally confirming to the IGAs when the show premiered that GenAI technology was used in the making of Clair Obscur, the committee ultimately chose to retract its wins for the two aforementioned categories, since any GenAI use at all goes directly against its rules regarding a game's eligibility.</p>



<p>The award for both categories was then given to the closest runner-up, which, for Debut Game, was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796580/Sorry_Were_Closed/">Sorry We're Closed</a>, and for Game of the Year was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Blue Prince</a>.</p>







<p>Sponsored by publishers like Annapurna and Panic, the Indie Game Awards is an annual awards show with a jury made up of several notable video games industry organizations, including the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) and indie-focused publications and creators.</p>



<p>It may not attract the audience size that The Game Awards does, but it is no less of an authority in the industry with its jury panel, which is partly what makes this whole situation so odd, as Sandfall Interactive seems to have potentially lied directly to notable industry bodies about its use of GenAI in Clair Obscur's development.</p>



<p>It could be that the representative who initially confirmed there was no GenAI use was unaware of it, and Sandfall never realized the confusion until it was too late. That's the most generous reading of what could have happened. The least generous would be that, even if Sandfall realized the issue, the studio chose not to make the IGAs aware and retract its own eligibility, for fear of drawing more attention to the fact that the studio did, in fact, use GenAI technology.</p>



<p>Whether you think GenAI tech should be used in game development or not, the last couple of weeks have proven that it is still a controversial topic among players and game developers alike. Everything that has happened so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">with Larian Studios admitting its own GenAI use</a> shows that no matter how universally beloved a studio and its work is, players and developers against GenAI technology will rally and loudly proclaim their disappointment.</p>



<p>That said, the reality of the video game industry seems to be turning more towards <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">more and more studios at least testing out the technology in their development pipelines</a>, if not using it to create final in-game assets. If none of those games continue to qualify for Indie Game Awards, it's unlikely they'll shed any tears about that. </p>



<p>But with how coy Sandfall Interactive has seemingly been with its own GenAI use, it seems like we're still going to have a fair share of developers who fear the backlash that comes with the public knowing you've 'gone to the dark side,' so to speak. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-skin-item-shop-most-used-2000655163</link>
            <guid>1390318</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> Chapter 7 introduced a Kim Kardashian skin into the battle royale’s shop as part of its Icon series, and though the media mogul and long-time law student wouldn’t be my first choice, she’s apparently everyone else’s (</span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-kim-k-most-popular-skin-landslide/"><span>h/t TheGamer</span></a><span>). According to recent stats from the independently operated site </span><a href="http://fortnite.gg/"><span>Fortnite.GG</span></a><span>, which scrapes publicly available information from the game and presents it in easy-to-read graphs, the “Iconic Kim Kardashian” skin, which first hit </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s shop on December 13, is the most popular skin of the season, with around 5 percent of players using it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For reference, the second-most used skin in Chapter 7 is Backlash, a sought-after, in-universe cosmetic that some players believe offers an in-game advantage because it can somewhat camouflage itself in certain areas on the map. Then there’s Cat Holloway, another in-universe character, followed by Chani, Zendaya’s character from the </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span> series. There are only four other skins in the top 15 that aren’t original </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> creations: Catwoman, rapper Playboi Carti, Lara Croft, and The Bride from </span><i><span>Kill Bill</span></i><span>. According to Fortnite GG, Kim Kardashian ranks 70th in all-time </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> cosmetic usage, and she’s only been available for a week and a half.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Kim Kardashian bundle, which is available in-store until December 28, is currently on sale for 3,000 V-Bucks (which is around $19). The bundle includes the Iconic Kim Kardashian skin (a black, latex-style catsuit reminiscent of one of her SKIMS styles); a regular Kim Kardashian skin (a removable fur coat, crop-top, and pants), two backpacks, two pickaxes, two emotes, and a glider.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I find some of her items to be painfully boring, this is one of the better </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skins I’ve seen for a major celebrity in terms of its recreation of Kardashian’s likeness (likely because she is particularly precious with her image) and its variety, which we’ll get to in a sec.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was a big year for Dill Bits. <a href="https://t.co/JqZ3LWna8S">pic.twitter.com/JqZ3LWna8S</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>A </span><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999/photo/1"><span>December 21 post on the official </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> X account</span></a><span> showing some 2025 highlights suggests these numbers are fairly accurate: the graphic shows that there were 37.5 million games played with Kim Kardashian (and 6.7 million games played with full squads of Sabrina Carpenters).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Kim Kardashian has a massive reach in the world of pop culture—her TV show, </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span>, regularly pulls in millions of viewers, and she has over 350 million followers on Instagram, putting her in the top ten most-followed accounts on the social media app (she’s got more than </span><span>Beyoncé</span><span>).&nbsp; But I think her popularity as a </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skin isn’t </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> because she’s a shrewd businesswoman who has cleverly tied her pop culture image into several successful brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>First, the Kim Kardashian Icon skin is incredibly customizable, more so than most skins in the game. Like Kardashian herself, many of the items in her bundle are basic. The crop top outfit is pedestrian, the makeup brush pick axe is expected (and she doesn’t even have a makeup brand anymore), and the private jet glider is whatever. But her Iconic catsuit skin has </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> many variations that you’re getting a ton of value for the cost. It can be a tank top, a mock neck, a turtle neck, or strapless. You can choose from seven different colors, some of which look more metallic or latex-y than others. You can put gloves on her or remove them. She can wear sunglasses or not. And her hair can be up in a messy bun, or down and either blonde or brunette.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s this customization, coupled with </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s vibrant community of girls and gays, that makes Kardashian’s skin so popular. Now the crew can drop in as a whole squad of varied Kims and mine the skin for its rich meme potential. I’ve seen dozens of clips of Kim K players </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@royaljkr/video/7583534305326959894"><span>hunting down a Chun-Li,</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fasher_off/video/7583810227443666198"><span>dancing in a circle with Peely</span></a><span>, or using the pocketbook pickaxe to</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user1235787271/video/7583773343791336759"><span> recreate an iconic </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span> clip.</span></a><span> Sabrina Carpenter’s skin was popular for similar reasons: it had several style options and, when coupled with her TikTok-friendly music and emotes, offered a steady stream of clip fodder.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And of course, there’s the gooner element. </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players used to love the aforementioned Chun-Li skin because of her ample ass, and now they’ve got Kim Kardashian’s behind to ogle while playing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you want to get </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s Kim Kardashian skin, it’s available until December 28.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Looking for a new portable speaker that’s great for taking anywhere you go? The Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is a great choice. Like all Marshall speakers, the Stanmore III has that classic Marshall look and feel that goes well with a bookshelf, desk, or media center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/">You can find the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker on Amazon for $299, previously priced at $400.</a> That’s $101 off and a 25% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable speaker fit for a rock star</h2>
<p>The Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker provides a high-quality, full-sounding output of music. This comes from the combination of two types of speakers (tweeters &amp; woofers) working together to provide clean and defined highs, as well as deep, rich lows. So no matter what you’re listening to, the audio feels very balanced and fun to listen to. The woven-grille fabric cover on the front protects the speakers from dirt and minor bumps. And its tribute to rock history makes it a fun addition to any collection.</p>
<p>Connecting your mobile device to the speaker via Bluetooth is extremely easy and fast. Once connected, there are no cords to mess with, and you’ll be able to control your playlists from anywhere in the room. Since this speaker allows multiple connections at one time, you can easily switch between users without having to disconnect and reconnect each time. This makes it perfect for parties or gatherings, where many guests want to play their own music.</p>



<p>Those that prefer a hands-on approach can easily adjust the volume, bass and treble with the controls on top of the speaker. Adjusting these settings takes only a few quick turns, allowing you to boost the bass for a workout playlist or add some extra treble for clear vocals.</p>
<p>When designing the Stanmore III, Marshall focused on using high-quality components and making sure they felt sturdy and long-lasting, but not too heavy. They designed the speaker to stay in place on a shelf or table, and it won’t slip around when playing music. In addition to feeling durable, the speaker withstands typical usage without showing a lot of wear.</p>
<p>All in all, the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is a cool looking, easy-to-use and a very powerful speaker that offers a ton of value at its price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/">As the price of the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is currently on sale for $299 on Amazon, which is down from $400</a>, it is a good option if you are looking for good sound and classic style without breaking the bank. For $299, the Marshall Stanmore III is great for performance that feels worth every penny.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn will get a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode in 2026.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival-horror third-person shooter released by Bloober Team this September. The title features a spectacular narrative blended with challenging gameplay, which has been well received by players. However, some have complained about it being too difficult for casual players. Now, the developers are introducing a new, easier difficulty mode to open the title for more players. </p>







<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-s-temporal-diver-mode-is-an-easier-difficulty-option">Cronos: The New Dawn’s Temporal Diver Mode is an Easier Difficulty Option</h2>



<p>Bloober Team posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new video</a> on their official YouTube channel, announcing the arrival of the Temporal Diver Mode difficulty option for Cronos: The New Dawn. The video shows a cinematic in which the Bloober Team HQ receives calls to lower the difficulty or introduce an easy mode for players because it can be too challenging for non-hardcore gamers, or players who wish to experience just the story. </p>



<p>The video ends with the developers addressing the players directly, stating that “Cronos: The New Dawn was a game developed to challenge the players.” However, they have heard the community’s feedback and acknowledged that some would like to explore the story at their own pace. Hence, they are working to create a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode and plan to release it in early 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since first releasing in 2022, open-world racing game CarX Street has gotten countless updates and pieces of new content, but the update it just dropped is one of its biggest yet. Titled Showdown, it adds a brand-new PvP team mode that pits street racers against pursuing law enforcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mode can be played by up to 16 people at a time, eight on each team. On one side, street racers need to reach a designated area to earn points and then deliver them to a garage. On the other side, police officers are rewarded for neutralizing racers in several different ways, which we’ll cover in detail in a bit.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/2-1766174008538.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each match is played in two rounds, with everyone randomly assigned to either the racers or police, then switching sides between rounds. So you’ll always play as a racer once and a police officer once. The racers have HP, and if their HP is brought down to zero, they lose all their undelivered points and respawn at the garage to try again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Racers lose HP when they run into environmental objects or other cars, so you can’t drive recklessly. But speed is still very important. If a racer drives too slowly while police cars are nearby, their HP will gradually be drained. So you need to make use of your nitro boosts and consistently drive as fast as possible while still keeping your car under control.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/4-1766174040402.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While racers earn points for safely reaching certain parts of the map, police officers earn points for actions that prevent it. They can score points for ramming racers’ cars, arresting racers, or using their unique ability to deploy spike strips that puncture racers’ tires. Plus, they can get points for assisting their teammates, so if you ram a racer that’s later arrested by someone else, you’ll still get points. Police cars can also teleport between police stations scattered across the city, meaning they can strategize and cut off escape routes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the police aren’t the only ones with a trick up their sleeves: Racers are equipped with an EMP that can temporarily disable any police cars caught in its radius. Both the police’s spike strip and the racers’ EMP are on cooldown timers, so be careful not to waste them. And for the sake of a fair match, cars in this mode are restricted by class, and tire wear and fuel are both ignored. So it’s all about driving skill and strategy, not raw vehicle stats and durability. Each round lasts for about 10 minutes, and whichever team manages to score the most points after two rounds wins.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/5-1766174103671.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer CarX Technologies has said that the dev team dreamed of creating a cops-and-racers mode since before the game originally launched in 2022, but it was too labor-intensive and complex to develop in tandem with the open-world experience the rest of the game offers. And the inclusion of unique features and visual effects makes it clear how much work went into this mode. Police cars have flashing lights and sirens, arrests are accompanied by voice lines from a police radio channel, and collisions and EMP activations feature unique glitch-like effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay experience of this mode is in stark contrast to the rest of the game, which sees you travel around the fictional Sunset City and its outskirts, facing off against local racing clubs that each have their own unique identity and narrative. You fine-tune your car, from the body kit and brake discs to the engine and suspension, gradually upgrading so you can qualify to take on more difficult opponents.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/9-1766174146261.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot went into the development of that core gameplay loop, which then needed to be polished for each platform CarX Street released on. It came to mobile first in 2022, then PC in August 2024, then finally PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S earlier this year. Its multiplatform approach resulted in success, reaching more than 1 million sales across Steam and consoles. Once they had it successfully running on all platforms, the dev team was able to focus on development of the new mode, which started about six months ago with the first concepts and prototypes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was meant to feel unlike anything else in the game, and police chases were always the primary focus. However, after extensive internal testing, the dev team realized police chases alone weren't enough. That’s how the unique abilities arose, resulting in the addition of spike strips and EMPs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/7-1766174764197.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say that the result accomplishes the goal of introducing a mode with completely different gameplay, but this is far from the end of the game’s evolution. CarX Technologies has stayed engaged with its community and gets regular feedback that helps guide their updates and new content, and that won’t stop anytime soon. Based on that feedback, they’ve previously mentioned that their future plans include additional competitive multiplayer modes, a dedicated highway network added to the open-world map, and a full story campaign with quests. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of the new mode and other planned updates, CarX Street is also currently on sale on Steam and Xbox, and it just launched a special promotion on PlayStation as well. So there’s never been a better time to get behind the wheel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> fans have accused EA of selling an AI-generated image after spotting a sticker of what looks like an M4A1 with two barrels in the in-game store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a similar generative AI controversy for rival shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Battlefield 6 has come under fire for selling what some fans have called “low quality AI generated garbage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sticker in question comes as part of the Windchill cosmetic pack for Battlefield 6, which costs 900 Battlefield Coins. It includes six items, one of which is a player card sticker called Winter Warning. The red flag here are two barrels on the M4A1, but the hand position of the soldier as well as the scope do not look properly aligned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remove this AI s**t from the store,” said redditor Willcario in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a thread upvoted 4,600 times</a>. “Two barrels on the M4A1, sure. I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI is one of the hottest topics in the video game industry, with the pressure on publishers to cut costs and speed up development in order to boost profits despite the risk of backlash from some fans. Indeed, according to a report by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Financial Times</u></a>, EA’s new prospective owners (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo"><u>the ones who just spent $55 billion to take the company private</u></a>) are betting on the use of generative AI to do just that. And EA itself, even before it was bought out, had signalled that it was all-in on generative AI, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>CEO Andrew Wilson insisting AI is at “the very core of its business.”</u></a></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This definitely looks AI Generated right? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/VLYMhEMOqQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VLYMhEMOqQ</a></p>— Battlefield 6 News (@BF6Updates) <a href="https://twitter.com/BF6Updates/status/2002568867575705950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While EA has yet to issue a statement on the Battlefield 6 allegations, fans are digging up past comments from Rebecka Coutaz, general manager of original series developer DICE in Sweden, and Criterion, the UK studio now also a part of what’s collectively called Battlefield Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6">who in October said players wouldn’t see anything made by generative AI in Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coutaz said that while generative AI “is very seducing,” currently there is no way to work it into the developers’ daily work. However, Coutaz clarified that generative AI is used in preparatory stages "to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is Battlefield 6's first significant generative AI controversy, Call of Duty has suffered a number of gen AI controversies in recent years, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash"><u>now-infamous six-fingered zombie Santa bundle</u></a>.

Currently, Battlefield 6 has no such AI content disclosure on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-responds-to-complaints-of-ai-generated-assets-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Activision issued a statement in response to a player outcry regarding the seeming use of generative AI art assets in a number of areas of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Players took to social media to complain about images they believed to be AI-generated across the game, primarily focusing on calling card images that they claimed used Studio Ghibli styling, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/studio-ghibli-ai-trend-sparks-chatgpt-backlash-resurfaces-old-comments-from-hayao-miyazaki-and-even-zelda-williams-has-waded-in"><u>a trend of AI-Ghibli images from earlier this year</u></a>. The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Steam page also includes the following disclaimer: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN reported on video game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-game-awards-strips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-of-game-of-the-year-over-gen-ai-dev-says-placeholder-textures-were-patched-out-after-slipping-through-qa-process"><u>which was stripped of its Game of the Year award by The Indie Game Awards over its use of generative AI</u></a>.

                <p dir="ltr">These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to "train" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use" rel="nofollow ">interview</a>, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">my review</a>. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/">Larian Studios' boss vouched</a> for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nexon-ceo-says-aaa-games-are-in-end-of-days-and-ai-is-about-to-rewrite-everything/1100-6536651/">AI is about to rewrite everything</a> in the games industry. Ubisoft announced it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-using-an-ai-tool-for-writing-in-its-games/1100-6512552/">using an AI tool to help write its games</a> in some instances. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/">Hideo Kojima, often considered a unique voice in the industry, says he uses it at times</a>. It's being presented as not just helpful, but inevitable.</p><p dir="ltr">Is it, though? It seems that most of the people vouching for the technology are C-suite executives and studio higher-ups, who are obviously invested in it, emotionally and professionally, because it has the chance to cut down on the time and money a project demands. But so much of what generative AI does is also, to put it bluntly, a crock of shit.</p><p dir="ltr">We know by now that, when used as a search engine, generative AI is woefully problematic. It's not scrubbing the internet for facts. It's a sentence construction guessing machine, in which each word in a sentence or paragraph is based on what it expects the right sequence of words or sentences to be, based on a mass of data it rips from whatever sources its creators have fed it. This allows for some AI bots, like X's Grok, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai/" rel="nofollow ">routinely express factually incorrect, sometimes even hateful rhetoric</a>. It was raised on the views of its CEO's exhausting edgelordism.</p><p dir="ltr">As a writing tool, generative AI is a legendary plagiarizer, remixing the mass of older books, articles, and other human-made works it's been fed and regurgitating them as pure, irredeemable slop, often sold for cheap on Amazon, where it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO6C14Tielx/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">preys on readers and gift-givers who don't have the internet literacy to recognize the mess they're buying</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">AI pictures and videos, meanwhile, are getting much more lifelike, which some say hurts the argument that we ought not use the tech. Others say they consult with AI-generated imagery merely as a jumping-off point, a brainstorming speedrun, where human artists take the kernels of ideas the AI creates and build on them from there. Executives, like Epic's Tim Sweeney, say generative AI will become so ubiquitous that efforts like Steam's labeling system used to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-disclosures-make-no-sense-for-game-stores-tim-sweeney-says/1100-6536526/"> disclose generative AI usage in games will quickly become pointless</a>. There's even some debate about just <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/09/what-you-need-to-know-about-ai-and-climate-change/" rel="nofollow ">how problematic it may be for the environment</a>, which further muddies the ethical questions surrounding the tech. When, if ever, is it reasonable to use it? But I find all of these caveats and arguments ultimately fail to respond to the most significant consideration that will be forever tied to generative AI, no matter how reliable, clean, or unbiased it could someday become: Our humanity matters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596258"></a><figcaption>In this image: how it sometimes feels to oppose the rise of generative AI in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Art is one of the greatest gifts we can give back to the world as human beings. The depth of our thinking and creating is unique to this world, possibly to this universe. I can't see a valid argument or excuse for the use case of generative AI that overcomes this truth. That's why Arc Raiders' use of it is so unfortunate. One of the best games of the year comes with this heavy asterisk beside it. Those voice actors deserved better, and their signing-away of their likenesses only hurts themselves and their peers, both currently and into the future. What seems true of this technology is that it tends to improve the more you train it. Because of that, using it is ethically questionable, and in some cases, such as the one in Arc Raiders, truly disheartening. Maybe Arc Raiders' AI voiceovers will get better with time, but that doesn't substitute for the fact that voice acting is a talent, an art form of its own, that deserves to be performed by people who bring authentic emotions to their roles, rather than bots that are faking it every step of the way.</p><p dir="ltr">What advocates for AI usage overlook is that the creation itself is a vital part of the project. This is what instills it with life and perspective. Generative AI can't be art because it's not made with a perspective; it's made with a prompt. Of all the counterarguments to using generative AI, I think this is the hardest to convey to people casually interested in the technology. The people who ask ChatGPT to conjure up a meme, write their cover letter, or answer their health-related questions may not be thinking about the cumulative human toll that using this tech takes. It's hard to quantify just why our humanity matters and how the use of generative AI harms it. It's sort of an abstract argument that must appeal to their hearts, first and foremost.</p><p dir="ltr">But there is also a practical argument, because the more we use generative AI, the more we are training it to replace us, as workers, as creators, as beings with a sense of belonging. As tech execs once again boat-race legislators on where the regulatory lines should be drawn, we are speeding toward a world where a highly exclusive few accumulate all the wealth, while working people are replaced industry by industry. There is an economic reckoning on the way, so any feeding of this beast becomes an architect of that dystopia. This issue stretches well beyond Arc Raiders and even well beyond games, of course. This is a problem that will worsen for everyone. It's hard for me to lose sight of that truth.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders proves how generative AI use doesn't necessarily ruin a game, but in its case, it hasn't really improved it either. It improves it from a workflow standpoint, some may say, but the finished artwork that is Arc Raiders doesn't seem to have been made better because of generative AI, so is it really worth the cost? As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-concept-artists-say-genai-isnt-making-things-easier/1100-6537107/">more developers speak out about obstacles being created by generative AI</a>, studios seem to be adopting it out of fear they'll be left behind, not realizing it's sometimes what slows others down.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this will be at the forefront of my on-the-job mind for the foreseeable future. I've done a lot of interviews here at GameSpot and expect to do many more. I'll ask developers I speak with how they plan to use this technology. I feel that we've reached an inflection point, a fork in the road. We can normalize this, accept it as inevitable, and let it further seep into games, TV, books, and other art forms we appreciate, or we can ask important questions. Why are you using this tech? What problems does it solve? What problems does it create? <em>Who benefits, and who is left behind?</em> Arc Raiders was a lightning rod for this topic here at the end of 2025. It's made my personal Game of the Year pick feel awkward and uncomfortable, but it's not the last of its kind. If executives can so thoughtlessly trade creative spirit for a percentage on their bottom line, I think it's extremely important that we challenge them to tell us why.</p>

                <p>The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be "more logical" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game. The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-star-reacts-to-tga-nomination-says-he-doesnt-deserve-all-the-credit/1100-6536464/" data-ref-id="1100-6536464">Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-says-hes-truly-grateful-for-outpouring-of-support-after-charlie-cox-spoke-out/1100-6536509/" data-ref-id="1100-6536509">Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that.</a></p><p>Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">took home the award</a>. In any event, Cazorla told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscurs-gustave-motion-performer-argues-game-awards-should-have-a-best-character-category-rather-than-isolating-a-single-performer-and-potentially-leaving-others-invisible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he believes a "Best Character category feels more logical" than "isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p><p>Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown.</p><p>Cazorla went on to say that it was an "incredible honor" for him that Cox "spoke publicly and acknowledged my work."</p><p>"I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," he said.</p><p>Cazorla said a character like Gustave is a "combination of these two performances," referencing his physical contributions to the motion capture and Cox's voice. He also gave credit to the "incredible writing and development work" for Gustave.</p><p>While Cazorla said he would like to see a Best Character award in the future, he's not so sure about an award for the best performance capture. "I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Cazorla said. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors."</p><p>Expedition 33's other major characters, including Maelle, Lune, and Verso were performed by multiple actors as well, Cazorla pointed out. "Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion-capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character," he said.</p><p>Given all that, Cazorla said he thinks the "fairest way to celebrate performers" is through an award, or some kind of recognition, that celebrates the character instead.</p><p>The DICE Awards already do this, Cazorla pointed out. "I think it's a very intelligent approach," he said. For the latest DICE Awards, the character Indiana Jones from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle won the award. He was performed by Troy Baker, for both his voice and the motion capture.</p><p>Expedition 33 just had one of its awards taken away, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">The Indie Game Awards revoked the title's Game of the Year win amid AI concerns.</a> GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">named Expedition 33 our Game of the Year. </a></p>
