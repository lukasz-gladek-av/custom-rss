			<p>A new Lossless Scaling Frame Generation Steam Deck plugin is now available, allowing users to boost performance in native and emulated games by up to four times.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by Deck Wizard provides a quick overview of the new plugin, the installation procedure and how it can be used to improve performance via frame generation with the 2x, 3x and 4x options. The video also shows some quick tests for multiple games, including Elden Ring, which can run at over 80 FPS on the system with the proper settings, Okami HD, and Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster, which can both run at above their 30 FPS lock. The plugin can also be used to improve performance in emulated games, as shown with Shadow of the Colossus.</p>

<p>Lossless Scaling Frame Generation has made incredible progress since its release, adding, over time, a 3x and 4x options which work decently enough, but are in no way on par with NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation, unsurprisingly. The 2x option, on the other hand, has been improved so much that in some games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-2x-comparable-dlss-4-frame-generation/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, it is almost on part with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation. As such, the app is an excellent choice for all those using previous generations NVIDIA GPUs like the RTX 2000 and 3000 series that will never get official Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>More information on the Lossless Scaling Frame Generation Steam Deck plugin can be found on its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TwvHdVucC3">Discord server</a>. The app is available for purchase <span>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">Steam</a> right now</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">.</a></p>

			<p>Another look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is coming next month right at the beginning of this year's Gamescom.</p>



<p>A new worldwide reveal of the next entry in the popular series has been confirmed for this year's Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will be held on August 19th from 2:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT / 8:00 PM CEST, host Geoff Keighley confirmed. This confirmation is rather interesting, as usually, reveals for the new entries in the Call of Duty series are held separately from bigger events, so there's still the chance that an event focused on the game could be coming at a later time.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS 7 worldwide reveal at Opening Night Live kicks off <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> in a massive way.</p><p>Tuesday, August 19.</p><p>Streaming live everywhere at 2p ET / 11a PT / 8p CEST. <a href="https://t.co/6HfSTirTze">pic.twitter.com/6HfSTirTze</a></p></div>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1944804083300270541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The confirmation of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal for Gamescom Opening Night is not completely surprising, despite no longer happening with a dedicated event focused on the game, as it was teased last month that the game would be shown again this Summer. The only look at the game to date was provided with a teaser shown at the end of this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase, which set the tone for the next entry in the series and for its 2035 future setting. It was also confirmed shortly after the showcase that the campaign will be entirely playable in co-op.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

Months later, the ruthless climbing sim for friends is one of Steam’s biggest surprise hits of 2025. Player reviews are full of examples that help explain why. “Told my friends with panic in my voice that the lava is rising even though it wasn’t, one friend panicked and died because of it,” read’s one Steam review. “10/10 game.”<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="338" data-playlist="195805,196013,195410" data-current="195805"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21320.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> It was a project born “mostly from jealousy,”Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told<em> PC Gamer </em>last month</a></span>. “At the time we were on the precipice of launching our biggest game ever, <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>—an intense 3+ year-long project that burnt a lot of us out.

So the team decided to partner with some of the 2024 co-op horror playground game’s developers on something similar, but with the disarmingly twee quirkiness that Aggro Crab is known for.</p><p>The result is <em>Peak</em>, a first-person hiking adventure in which players control lo-fi, child-like avatars as they help one another traverse through hazardous terrain like steep cliffs and scorching lava pits. The game is cheap, just $8 to download, exploits social dynamics for drama and comedy in otherwise familiar gameplay scenarios, and is catnip for social media. TikTok and Instagram are full of perfectly meme-able moments that usually entail one player accidentally falling to their doom as their proximity chat screams gradually fade away.

It’s retained its “mostly positive” rating over 40,000 user reviews later. Like so many indie games that blow up on Steam, iterating on current fads often trumps dream projects years in the making, at least when it comes to grabbing that bag, though it no doubt helps that <em>Peak </em>is also a lot of fun.

John Wick Hex was originally published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, and it was released on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Good Shepherd's parent company, Devolver Digital, shifted the publishing rights for John Wick Hex to another one of its smaller companies, Big Fan Games, in 2024.</p><p>John Wick Hex is currently <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/john-wick-hex?irclickid=3NISJV1K-xycUhN0CIwuRwDlUksSc4S9QW9VXI0&amp;sharedid=&amp;irpid=1804712&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Fandom%20-%20Gamespot&amp;utm_content=1804712&amp;utm_term=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;irgwc=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on Humble Bundle for only $4</a>.

            <p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio behind the God of War series, is working on a new game, but reportedly it won't be a new IP though "it might feel like one".</p>
<p>There's been plenty of speculation around what the studio may be working on next, in particular game director Cory Barlog. He was responsible for the God of War reboot in 2018, but on its sequel he was producer.</p>
<p>Now, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier has addressed the speculation on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">ResetEra</a>, calling Barlog's game "Sony Santa Monica's next big thing" and that "it was going well" at least a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>In a later response, Schreier added it won't be a new IP and it certainly won't be a sci-fi game.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: it’s not a new IP but it might feel like one," Schreier said. "Maybe that's why people are confused. Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum. And that the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."</p>
<p>Rumours swirled in August last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">Sony Santa Monica was developing its first new IP in over 20 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear if the studio has multiple projects, or if indeed its next game will be part of an existing franchise. The obvious conclusion is a new game in the God of War series, likely with a new direction.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-work-graphs-adoption-cross-gen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-xbox-next-won%E2%80%99t-see-widespread-adoption-of-directx-12-work-graphs-especially-in-the-cross-gen-period-%E2%80%93-rumor.1243851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature will be part of next-gen game development, it won't see massive adoption on PlayStation 6 and the next generation Xbox, especially in the cross-generation period.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627665">commented</a> on the possibility of next-generation consoles having access to the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature, which delivers better performance and improved scalbility across complex workloads including procedural generation, particle systems and AI logic, saying that while <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627867">hardware and API will be ready</a>, it is unlikely to see widespread adoption, as the engines and tools currently in use don't support this style of graphics programming. As such, it will be a while to see if the feature will bring significant performance improvements on consoles that go well beyond what we have already seen on PC<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-performance-boost/"> shortly after its release.</a></p>



<p>Very little is currently known about next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft, other than the fact that they are in the works. While rumors on the next Xbox are scarce, there's been considerably more unconfirmed information on the PlayStation 6, which is supposedly launching in two different editions - a home console and a portable system speculated to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/">more powerful than the Xbox Series S </a>that will be able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">run PlayStation 5 games natively</a>, although performance may not be great without developer intervention.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bithell Games and publisher Big Fan have announced that fast-paced tactical game&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted from all storefronts in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will be removed from digital storefronts on July 17th. That includes PC and consoles; as the two studios say, as of that date, "new purchases of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront".</p>

<p>However, if you do already own the game, then you'll still be able to play it after that date. That includes both physical and digital copies, thankfully, so it's not completely disappearing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/john-wick-hex-delisting-shooting.jpg?itok=WjI3_x27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/john-wick-hex-delisting-shooting.jpg?itok=8kNE40Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted this week.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, it's a tactical strategy game created by&nbsp;<em>Thomas Was Alone&nbsp;</em>and <i>Subsurface Circular&nbsp;</i>developer Mike Bithell under his Bithell Games label.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-goes-tactical-on-epic-store-with-john-wick-hex" rel="nofollow">in May 2019</a> and released in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-hex-launches-for-pc-on-october-8th-consoles-to-follow" rel="nofollow">October that same year</a>, the game takes place prior to the events of the popular&nbsp;<em>John Wick&nbsp;</em>movies. It sees the titular hitman descending into the underworld to rescue allies Winston and Charon from a new enemy calling himself Hex.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>offers what Bithell calls "fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game", with the gameplay "capturing the series' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, which shows off the game's unique graphic novel art style and some of its tactical gameplay, right here.</p>




<p>Big Fan and Bithell Games didn't give any reason for the sudden delisting of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, but it's almost certainly got something to do with licensing rights, given that the game is based on an existing property.</p>

<p>If you do want to grab&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>before it's delisted, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1405790/John_Wick_Hex/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/john-wick-hex/9pb1c8s0922m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/john-wick-hex-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as their current-gen successors via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <p>Fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch alert. This one's patch 01.003.200, and it brings the latest in pointy flag tip technology, in addition to another round of weapon balancing. You'll need that flag stabbiness too, as the latest Galactic War twist has seen the Automatons try to wrestle control of Super Earth's space station.</p>
<p>Yep, stop trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">rename a city 'Gun'</a> for five minutes, some stuff's going down in HD2 that you need to be clued in on, even if its just so you can run around the room cheering at how much more effective your Flame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sentry">Sentry</a>'ll now be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As has become the standard for Helldivers 2 updates that pass a certain beefiness threshold, patch 01.003.200 has both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/601909716088521243?l=english">notes</a> and a video explainer that sees design director Niklas Malmborg joined by senior designer Patrik 'Fluffy' Lasorta to talk through the changes.</p>
<p>First of all, the devs have slightly reduced the time it takes your diver to get up after ragdolling, as well as boosting chest injury bleed damage because the latter was previously at a level so low that "it appeared to have no effect". There are also a bunch of tweaks to weapons, mainly aimed at boosting how effective stunning, bayonet-induced stagger, and the firestarting capabilities of stuff like the aforementioned Flame Sentry are.</p>

<p>By far the most important change, however, is the following one to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">Masters of Ceremony warbond</a>'s One True Flag stratagem. "Thanks to some groundbreaking military research into pointier flag tips, the flag can now be proudly planted directly into enemies — dead or alive — ensuring the eternal colors of Super Earth are never tainted, only quenched by the blood of its foes," Arrowhead wrote, with Malmborg adding in the video that "a surprising amount of code" needed messing with to pull this off.</p>
<p>Hellpods and enemies have also undergone some tweaks, but I'm now gonna pivot to something far more urgent. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1394621065032106064">fresh Major Order</a> dropped alongside this patch, and it's seeing the Automatons move to secure sites key to the running of the Democracy Space Station - which the divers have been using to help further Super Earth's goals since late last year.</p>
<p>Claorell, Tarsh, and Gaellivare are the planets folks are being tasked with holding to prevent the DSS being destroyed or falling into enemy hands. Arrowhead also notes that "enemy troop movements indicate this is only the first of several planned waves of attack", meaning "additional invasions are anticipated".</p>
<p>So, it looks like defending the floating hunk of metal is gonna be the next big goal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-lets-you-impale-baddies-with-flags-as-the-bots-take-aim-at-the-democracy-space-station]]></content:encoded>

Those precious few milliseconds may make all the difference, especially on harder difficulties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the flag can now be “proudly” planted directly into enemies — dead or alive — “ensuring the eternal colors of Super Earth are never tainted, only quenched by the blood of its foes.” So, if you want that Charger to be running around with your flag on its back, now you can make it happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of balance changes worth checking out in the patch notes below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are hotting up in the world of Helldivers 2, with the PC and PS5 game set to become the first PlayStation Studios-published title ever on Xbox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">when it launches on Series X and S next month alongside crossplay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 update 01.003.200 patch notes:</p><h2 data-cy="title1">🌍 Overview</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Balancing</li><li>Mission Fixes</li><li>Weapon Fixes</li><li>Miscellaneous Fixes</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">⚖️ Balancing</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Helldiver</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced the time it takes for the Helldiver to regain control after ragdolling from 0.8 to 0.5 sec</li><li>Increased chest injury bleed damage from 1 to 10.

<p>Though how successful it will be remains to be seen</p>

<figure><a title="Switch eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95f062d6a1ddf/switch-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has seemingly taken steps to combat so-called 'eSlop' on the Switch 2 – at least in Japan and some regions in Asia.</p>
<p>In a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rolls-out-new-eshop-publishing-guidelines-for-switch-2-in-asia-seemingly-to-curb-spam-games">IGN</a>, Nintendo has implemented new guidelines for publishing on the Switch 2 eShop, most (if not all) of which appear to be targeting the relentless proliferation of low-quality 'eSlop' games. How successful this proves to be remains to be seen in these early days, but it at least sounds like Nintendo is <em>trying</em> to make the eShop a much better experience on Switch 2 than its predecessor.</p>
<p>So what at the guidelines? Well, the first is all about bundles. The new rule states that the maximum number of titles eligible for bundles is five within the first year of a game's release. This number then increases by one for each year the game is available, up to a maximum of eight. This is seemingly targeting a tactic used by some publishers in which constant bundles would be advertised to keep their games near the top of the eShop listings.</p>
<p>The second guideline looks at sensitive content. Nintendo specifically states what would constitute sensitive content, and this includes "sexualization of children, overly sexual content, discrimination and hate, exploitation of social issues, instructing criminal activity, and political statements". The third guideline targets games with inaccurate descriptions, stating "It is prohibited to provide inaccurate descriptions of the contents of a product. It is prohibited to provide description of the content of a product as under development if it is not expected to be implemented in the product".</p>
<p>And finally, Nintendo is prohibiting any drastic changes to a game without due cause, including any title changes and anything that might severely differentiate the title from its presence on other platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, titles found to be violating these guidelines may lead to revisions being requested from Nintendo, or in some cases, a complete refusal to sell the game on the eShop. As we mentioned at the top, it's still early days yet, so it remains to be seen just how successful these guidelines may prove in keeping the 'eSlop' out, but hopefully we'll see a lot more curation on the eShop in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to let you know if and when these guidelines are implemented in the West.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The times of transition between two console generations are often fraught, with publishers trying to sell to two ever-shifting markets, with their expectations of forward or backward compatibility, and the perceived inherent unfairness of needing to buy the same game twice. Square Enix has taken an interesting approach to this when it comes to <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</em>: tell everyone tough shit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The forthcoming re-re-re-remake of the first two <em>Dragon Quest</em> games is due October 30, coming to all current consoles and both the Switch and the Switch 2. Square Enix has made it clear that the Switch 2 version will take advantage of the brand new console’s more advanced tech, explaining this distinction by saying “each version has a different graphical specification based on the hardware’s processing capabilities.” The publisher goes on to point out that beyond this, there are no differences to what’s actually <em>in</em> the game, whether that’s story or in-game items. OK, that all makes sense.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq1and2/faq/en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq1and2/faq/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new FAQ on the Japanese site for the series</a></span> then breaks down potential confusion over compatibility: the Switch 1 version will work on the Switch 2, but the Switch 2 version won’t work on the Switch 1 (perfectly normal, but underlined by the Switch 2 build coming with an empty cart). Further, playing the Switch 1 version on the Switch 2 won’t unlock its improved version, but rather run exactly the same as it would on the original console. Right, that sucks, but sure. So, given all this, what’s the option for people who buy the Switch 1 cart, but then get a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the improved graphics in the game? Um, the option is to spend another $60 and buy the whole game over again.</p><p>“Can copies of the Switch version of DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake be upgraded to the Switch 2 version?” the FAQ asks itself, rather tellingly acknowledging the frequency with which such a question will be asked. “No,” it replies to itself, “there is no upgrade path currently available or planned. Please buy your copy for whichever system you would like to play it on.”</p><p>Clearly any publisher can do whatever it wants. What Square apparently wants is to roll its eyes and flip a finger at anyone who might upgrade from their current console to the new one at any point after they’ve bought this game. And it’s that peculiarly forthright attitude of, “Just buy the right version,” in the FAQ that makes it much harder to swallow.</p><p>It’s not exactly an inconceivable situation that a Switch 1 owner might buy this remake of the classic 1986 <em>Dragon Warrior </em>and its 1987 sequel in October this year, and then a couple of months later, under their Christmas tree, discover a shiny new Switch 2. Now, the “copy for whichever system you would like to play it on” has rather dramatically changed. That person might, quite reasonably, assume there would be a way to upgrade their version of the game for this new device, and they wouldn’t be wildly out of order to think they might be allowed to do that for free. At the very worst, for something like a $10 fee, as outrageous as that would be given both the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game cost exactly the same.</p><p>It’s worth noting that saves won’t be able to transfer between the two versions, either, suggesting these are two incompatible versions of the same game.</p><p>So, should you be one of the the very many people who will be in this situation or one like it, Squeenix’s expectation is that you just spend another $60 on a game you already bought. Obviously, most people will just play the crappier Switch 1 version on their Switch 2 and take their lumps, making it even harder to see why the Japanese publisher would take such a bizarre  path. Just let people upgrade their copy, Square! What’s going on here?</p><p>We’ve reached out to Square Enix to try to understand the thinking behind this decision, and will update this article should we find out.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-square-enix-switch-2-upgrade-1851786270]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI development seems to be proceeding well, so much so that the expectations of the game appearing during this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase weren't just speculation, but an educated guess.</p>



<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDr2ZSFIEXk&amp;t=4105s">XB2 podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden commented on the sixth entry in the series, saying that it is in a "quite playable" state, without providing any additional information, and that the game's current state is the reason why the game could have been expected to be shown at this year's Xbox Games Showcase. Unfortunately, the game's release window remains unknown, as Corden has no idea how far along the game is, as finding sources inside Bethesda is difficult.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it has been a long time since the release of the fifth entry in the series, fans of the Bethesda series can make the wait for The Elder Scrolls VI more bearable by returning to Cyrondiil with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The remaster uses Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the game's original engine for gameplay, offering an experience that is extremely faithful to the original while updating it where needed.

It's who you did it to.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The only officially licensed John Wick video game is being removed from sale just six years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bithell Games’ well-received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-wick-hex">John Wick Hex</a> launched in October 2019. It’s a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game “that makes you think and strike like John Wick.” John Wick, of course, is the hugely popular action hero made famous by Keanu Reeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward six years and John Wick Hex is set for the digital scrapheap. In an update directed at the game’s community, publisher Big Fan Games (which is part of Devolver Digital) said John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After July 17, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries across PC and console, and of course physical copies will continue to work on console. However, new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Fan Games failed to say why John Wick Hex was being removed from sale, but it seems likely it's the result of the expiration of its licence with John Wick rights holder Lionsgate Entertainment. IGN has asked Big Fan for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expiration of a licence is one of the main reasons video games end up being pulled from storefronts; you see it most often with video games that have licensed music.

            <p>As part of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month, Microsoft cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a> developers ZeniMax Online Studios. Now, the union that represents a number of devs left in limbo by that game's canning have issued an update about the process of fighting for their futures.</p>
<p>ZOS' MMO, codenamed Project Blackbird, wasn't the only game Microsoft pulled the plug on as they let go of around 9k people. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Rare's Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot were also wiped out, with the latter studio being shuttered to boot.</p>

<p>"Earlier this month, Microsoft indefinitely shelved an unannounced MMORPG at ZeniMax Online Studios, a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on the project," wrote ZeniMax Online Studios United (ZOSU), not to be confused with similarly named union ZeniMax Workers United. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">The former</a> represents web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists who were working on ESO and this unannounced MMO, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">the latter</a> is focused on QA staff.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, a future has been stolen from many of us and our community will never experience an amazing game," they continued, "However, despite discussions regarding the status of our employment, the fact is: we have not yet been laid off."</p>

</span></p><p>The current state of play the union outline is that their "worker-volunteers" are busy bargaining with Microsoft on behalf of those affected members.</p>
<p>"Where Microsoft has failed to support the talented craftspeople who have generated billions in revenue, our union has stepped up to provide clarity and support," they wrote. "It is true that a layoff may be in the future for some of our members. However, as a result of our organising, we are able to ensure that those impacted will be able to depart with dignity."</p>
<p>While being able to "depart with dignity" potentially being the best outcome some of these devs can hope for doesn't sound all that comforting, one can only imagine how much worse a situation these devs might be in without something in place to help fight their case.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that if any of these devs do end up out of a job, they are able to at least go with favourable exit terms and compensation. It's the least they'd deserve following, in the union's words, a situation that's meant "lives were upended <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">without prior notice or communication</a> from Microsoft leadership".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Octopath Traveller co-developer Acquire is working on three new original games, in a new deal with Middle Eastern publisher Red Dunes Games.</p>
<p>Acquire (owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>) is best known for the likes of Tenchu and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a>, as well as supporting Nintendo's RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> and co-developing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Octopath Traveller games.</p>
<p>The three original games in development will be shown at this year's Tokyo Game Show in September, as reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2025/07/14/tenchu-studio-acquire-and-red-dunes-games-unveil-global-co-dev-deal/">Forbes</a>, and will be released on PC and major consoles. The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Tremor (featuring "city-shaking kaiju battles")</li>
<li>Project Umbra ("dark fantasy hunts")</li>
<li>Project Shadowcar ("a shadowy espionage thriller")</li>
</ul>

<p>"As Acquire, a studio that has long valued originality from Japan in game development, we are thrilled to have found a wonderful partner in Red Dunes Games and embark on a bold new global challenge together," said CEO Takuma Endo.</p>
<p>"We've always believed in the power of originality. Now, with Red Dunes, we're building something truly international."</p>
<p>Red Dunes Games, based in Abu Dhabi, has until now focused on indie games, but is looking to expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>"Acquire is a legendary studio with a deep creative legacy, and we are honoured to work with them to build the next wave of original games," said Sultan Darmaki, CEO and creative director. "This partnership is a reflection of our belief that the future of gaming lies in global collaboration, where stories cross borders, and innovation knows no region."</p>
<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership released last year. "A relatively minor instalment, but in a series this magical, that's still good news," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">our review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveller-co-developer-working-on-three-new-original-games-coming-to-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>
