<p>Earlier today, the game's developer shared five new profiles, and a bunch of new screenshots, of the cast on the official website (via <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-characters-zeldas-maid/">Nintendo Everything</a>). So we now know the names of the four Sages (well, their Japanese-translated names) and of... Zelda's maid?</p>
<p>First up, we have Argusta, the Goron Sage and leader of the Goron Tribe. Known as a close friend to Rauru, he is a kind, generous, and intelligent ruler. Kia is next, the Zora Sage and princess who is a master of martial arts. She's known for her bravery, which inspires her people.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Krafika is the Rito leader and the Rito Sage, and perhaps not the easiest to understand. However, he is loyal and cares about his friends. The last of the Sages then is Ardi, a member of the Gerudo tribe and a follower of Ganondorf, the current leader.</p>
<p>Of everyone here, though, we <em>most</em> want to meet Lanaria (or Ranaria), who is Zelda's maid. Trusted by Rauru, she's is a gentle woman who is both quick at her work and is fascinated with the mystical. She's always carrying around a notebook with her.</p>


<p>While that's not a ton of new info, simply knowing <em>anything</em> about the Sages is a big deal at this stage. Especially given that we're one month away from the game's release date.</p>
<p>We got a chance to go hands-on with Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-zelda-layton-mega-man-10-games-we-played-at-tgs-2025-coming-to-switch-1-and-2">very briefly at Tokyo Game Show</a>, and we're pretty excited to see what this "canonical" prequel brings to the Tears of the Kingdom story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 PlayStation 5 retail version reportedly has the full game on disk, requiring no additional download to play both the campaign and the multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">series' official subreddit</a>, retail copies of the highly anticipated new entry in the series launching this week are already in the hands of some lucky players. One of these users reported that the full game is on disk and can be played without an additional download, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">reversing a disappointing industry trend</a>. In addition, multiplayer servers are reportedly live, so those with early copies can already enjoy the full experience with no limitations.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Putting the full game on disk to avoid mandatory launch downloads is yet another indication of how the Battlefield 6 development teams have placed a greater focus on the technical elements of the game. With  solid optimization on every platform, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Xbox Series S</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">minimum spec PC hardware</a>, the market is set to reward this approach significantly, judging from pre-order numbers. According to data firm Ampere Analysis, the game has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-1-7-million-pre-orders-predicted-to-sell-5-million-first-week/">estimated 1.7 million pre-orders, and is expected to sell 5 million units in the first week of availability.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-microsoft-isnt-giving-up-console-development.1317625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has reiterated its intention to remain in the first-party console business, despite rumors swirling recently that the company may be contemplating an exit from that side of its operations.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft says it is "actively investing in [its] future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered, and built by Xbox", which is a pretty definitive rebuttal of rumors to the contrary.</p>

<p>The company also suggested that those who want to see proof of its commitment to the console business can remind themselves of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">the agreement</a> Xbox made with AMD back in June, which will see the tech company creating chips for new Xbox devices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=nkZV2fzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=t0lUZem6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Despite its current multi-device "This Is an Xbox" campaign, Xbox insists it hasn't given up on hardware development.</figcaption></figure><p>Recent rumors appear to have started with leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/post-270866538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SneakersSO</a> (who was previously apparently responsible for leaking the news that Xbox would port its games to other hardware, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">erstwhile rival PlayStation</a>).</p>

<p>The leaker said over the weekend that Xbox's future lay in software rather than hardware, and that previously "concrete" plans for new Xbox hardware had become "up in the air". Evidently, that's not the case, or at least that isn't the image Microsoft wants to publicly project.</p>

<p>If Microsoft were to pull out of the console race, it wouldn't necessarily be an entirely ridiculous decision. According to Aldora Intelligence's sales data (via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-ps5-versus-xbox-sales-estimates-are-probably-worse-than-youd-expect/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes</a>), Xbox Series X|S sales are sitting at under half of the PlayStation 5's numbers, having failed to break 30 million between the two available machines.</p>

<p>These are not, however, official figures; Microsoft is,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">unlike Sony</a>, fairly reticent about regularly announcing how many Xbox Series consoles it's managed to sell. Still, it's fair to say Xbox is almost certainly trailing Sony quite significantly in terms of hardware sales.</p>




<p>Microsoft's statement comes after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">introduced new tiers for its Game Pass subscription service</a> last week, with Ultimate now costing an eye-watering $30 per month. That move itself came after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">revealed that this year marked its "largest investment"</a> in the service to date.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-cancelled-dates-delay-us-tour-2000632085</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-cancels-most-of-its-concert-series-without-explanation-update.1317616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-last-us-god-war-horizon-ghost-1851784665"><span>PlayStation: The Concert</span></a><span>, an orchestral show featuring music from games such as </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, and more, was scheduled to begin the American leg of its tour this week with a show at Williamsport’s Community Arts Center. However, it seems like the tour might be collapsing in on itself days before the first show, as Sony has started canceling performances without explanation.</span></p> <p><span>The show’s </span><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/playstation-the-concert-tickets/artist/3244629"><span>Ticketmaster page</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-quietly-cancels-remaining-playstation-the-concert-2025-tour-dates-in-the-us/"><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>) lists several of its remaining 2025 shows as canceled, with tickets for only a few still for sale. To some extent, this isn’t much of a surprise, as the concert series had already canceled </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-the-concert-is-reportedly-cancelling-numerous-tour-dates-and-delaying-others/"><span>several of its UK shows earlier this year</span></a><span> and pushed them to next summer. Right now, it looks like most of the US cancellations are just that, rather than postponements to another date. I checked some of the listings that have yet to be officially canceled on the site, but I was still met with an error message saying tickets were no longer available on Ticketmaster. At the moment, the concert’s 2026 dates remain largely untouched on Ticketmaster’s website.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has yet to explain the reasoning behind the cancellations, but we have reached out for comment and will update this story if we hear back. Some speculate that poor ticket sales may have played a part, as some attendees noted </span><a href="https://x.com/Hazzehh/status/1914836561402744976"><span>a lot of empty seats at their shows</span></a><span>, though other performances </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magictreehouse.bsky.social/post/3lnj7g35t7s2x"><span>look pretty packed</span></a><span>. I wouldn’t be surprised if, even with the PlayStation branding, the show wasn’t drawing a lot of people in because it seemed very fixated on the PlayStation 4 and 5 era, spotlighting games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, rather than making a show that encompassed a wide spread of the brand’s history. I feel like a dedicated show for any of those franchises would have pulled in crowds, but when you put them all under one umbrella and the whole thing seems like an ahistorical account of PlayStation history, I can see why people might not be flocking to buy tickets. It also doesn’t help that Sony didn’t have a huge marketing push behind the tour. I frankly forgot that it was coming up, and I was supposed to go to the Madison Square Garden show.</span></p>

 <p><strong>Update, 10/6/25 at 11:45 a.m.:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>GEA Live, the company behind the PlayStation Concert, has released the following statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is with great regret that we have cancelled the PlayStation | The Concert tour in North America. Our team has spent a considerable amount of time developing this project, and we share in the disappointment of fans who will no longer be able to attend. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the show and appreciate your understanding in making this difficult decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though the initial statement reads as if the rest of the North American tour has been canceled, GEA Live representatives clarified in a follow-up statement that it specifically refers to the 2025 dates.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7%E2%80%99s-beta-has-players-complaining-about-matchmaking-and-doors.1317613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Oh hey, a new <i>Call of Duty </i>is on the horizon. This time it’s <i>Black Ops</i> season (even though we just had one of those), and to help them fine-tune its competitive action and the overall ebb and flow of its speedy combat (as well as to test the game’s anti-cheat tech), developers Treyarch and Raven Software ran a beta for those with an active pre-order over the weekend.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>BLOPS7</i> aims to be a very fast</a>, bouncy shooter of a game, with players granted the ability to jump off walls much like they could in <i>Titanfall</i>. It looked super fun in motion during the multiplayer reveal last week, but now that folks have finally been able to pour into the lobbies and get some matches in, how did it all work out?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> Shows Off Everything Coming To Multiplayer At Launch</a></p> <p>TL;DR: The community is really upset over doors; TTK rates might be a touch too high; no one will ever be satisfied with SBMM; and <i>Battlefield</i> threatens to eat <i>COD</i>’s lunch for the first time in a long while.</p>

 <h2>Cheaters got the boot (most of ‘em, anyway)</h2> <p>This weekend’s beta was a perfect opportunity for <i>Call of Duty</i>’s anti-cheat initiative, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268">Team Ricochet</a>, to test out their defenses. And from the sounds of things, cheaters had a hard time getting into matches. TMP 2.0, along with whatever other magic Team Ricochet is using to block cheaters, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/article/1974942752485077132">appears to have caught 97 percent</a> of cheaters “within 30 minutes of their first sign-in,” with “fewer than one-percent of cheating attempts reach[ing] a match, and those that did were removed within minutes.”</p>

 <h2>SBMM, the eternal debate</h2> <p>Discourse over skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) was at the heart of last weekend’s beta, with a mode that specifically sought to avoid this controversial form of matchmaking. SBMM aims to make sure you’re matched with other random players of similar skill level. Sounds good in theory, but in practice it tends to be a bit of a tricky situation, especially if you’re playing with a friend who’s of a different skill level than you, resulting in unfair pairings. It can also make games feel more competitive and sweaty when some folks are just looking for a chill set of rounds.</p>

   <p>The debate over SBMM is sure to rage on, but Treyarch and Raven seem to be aware that not everyone’s a fan. During the beta, “<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct4">Open Moshpit” was introduced</a> to let folks jump into matches where “skill consideration is drastically reduced.”</p>

 <h2>Time-to-kill rates and those frakin’ doors!</h2> <p>Time-to-kill (TTK), the average amount of time it takes a player to die while being shot, would appear to be pretty speedy in <i>BLOPS7</i>. Perhaps too speedy. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct3">The devs are aware</a> that folks are finding they die a bit too quickly right now, and so they’ll be “releasing a weapon balance patch in the coming days to adjust TTK and ensure all weapons available in the beta are competitive.”</p>

 <p>Quick deaths weren’t the only issue some folks had. Doors, it would seem, really got under some players’ skin. Though doors in <i>BLOPS7</i> maps are automatic (they can be shot to open them too), they don’t stay open, and the interruption of sightlines and the unwelcome surprise of running into someone you didn’t expect runs counter to the flow of gameplay many folks expect from <i>COD</i>. (Previous games saw doors stay open during a match.)</p>  <p>There aren’t too many doors, however. Treyarch reports that just five of its 16v16 maps currently have them. Still, the team is looking to possibly reduce that number, with an option to disable them in private matches.</p> <h2>The <i>Battlefield</i>-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/the-black-ops-7-beta-introduced-a-mode-without-sbmm-and-call-of-duty-players-are-psyched-we-need-battlefield-6-to-come-out-every-year/">reported by <i>GamesRadar</i></a>, the upcoming <i>Battlefield 6</i>, which is shaping up to be somewhat of a return-to-form for the beleaguered military shooter franchise, seems to be spooking Treyarch and Activision a bit. That the devs even considered removing SBMM via Open Mosphit, according to some, is proof that <i>COD</i>’s gonna do whatever it takes to try and offer an alternative to the allure of <i>Battlefield</i>.</p> <p>At the very least, it should be entertaining to see where this arms race between <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>COD</i> will go as we near the release of both games. <i>Battlefield 6</i> arrives on October 10, 2025, with <i>Black Ops 7</i> following it a month later on November 14.</p>

Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when <em>Darkborn</em> was cancelled, and because of this team’s loyalty and refusal to quit, <em>Metal: Hellsinger</em> was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</p><p>We had hoped to do something even better this time—.</p><p>—things don’t always go the way you hope.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting.</p><p>Thanks so much.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-shuts-down]]></content:encoded>

One person on Reddit posted a photo of the game's Phantom Edition for PS5. It sports the PEGI logo, which means the copy of game likely came from a European retailer, but it's not clear which one.</p><p>Many theorized that, although this person obtained a copy of the game early, they might not be able to play until the servers officially go live. However, the person said the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">servers are online already and the campaign is playable as well.</a> Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">EA says Battlefield 6 servers go live on October 10. </a></p><p>Others have apparently <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1975197858497454532" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">obtained a physical copy of Battlefield 6 already as well</a>. Given this, people who care about spoilers for the campaign may want to be extra mindful for the next few days until launch.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC; it's not coming to last-gen platforms and there is no early access like there was for Battlefield 2042.</p><p>The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">not coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, but EA Play Pro subscribers can get Battlefield 6's Phantom Edition ($100 USD) as part of the subscription, which costs $17/month.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first entry in the series since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a game that was a disappointment for many fans. Early signs look more positive for Battlefield 6, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">experts do not believe the game has enough juice to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year.</a> In any event, EA is having some playful fun with the competition, recently releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-live-action-trailer-pokes-fun-at-call-of-duty/1100-6535075/" data-ref-id="1100-6535075">live-action trailer for Battlefield 6</a> that roasts Call of Duty.</p><p>In other news, Battlefield owner EA is in the process of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">acquired by an investor consortium</a> led by Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>

                <p>Recently, a rumor swirled online that Microsoft was canceling its next-generation Xbox plans, but that is apparently not true or the full story. Microsoft said in a statement that it is "actively investing" in future first-party consoles and devices that are "designed, engineered, and built by Xbox."</p><p>The statement, shared with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, pointed fans to the announcement from June this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft is working with AMD on future consoles and devices. </a></p><p>At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond said Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room and in your hands."</p><p>In February 2024, Bond said the next Xbox would offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><h2><strong>What did the original source say?</strong></h2><p>The rumors that Microsoft had canceled future Xbox hardware plans stemmed from <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/page-29#post-270866538" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum member SneakersSO</a>, who said plans for future Xbox hardware had morphed from "really concrete" to "up in the air." The internet did what the internet does and extrapolated from this that plans for future Xbox devices made by Microsoft had been canceled, even though the source did not say that.</p><p>The person added that Microsoft's future may be more focused on games, and specifically its biggest franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Candy Crush, and Forza Horizon and away from dedicated hardware. To that end, the report said Microsoft will look to further push Xbox Cloud Gaming on more devices to help drive Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren, a person known for breaking stories about Xbox, said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ny8bms/tom_warren_sneakersso_knows_a_lot_of_what_goes_on/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this person is known to have reliable sources and good information</a>. This is presumably part of the reason why the "Xbox is dead" story spread so fast and wide over the weekend prior to Microsoft issuing its statement.</p><h2><strong>Xbox's struggles</strong></h2><p>It's no secret that the Xbox platform is lagging behind PlayStation this console generation, with monthly US sales reports from Circana showing Xbox regularly ranking third against PlayStation and Nintendo. Microsoft itself has told fans they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">do not need an Xbox to play Xbox games</a>. Thanks to Game Pass and the cloud, the devices people may already own--including a smartphone or tablet--can play Xbox games via Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is reminding people of this with its "This is an Xbox" campaign.</p><p>Xbox has also faced public perception challenges of late thanks to the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">mass layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures</a>. Most recently, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's price by 50%, up to $30/month</a>, with many saying Microsoft is a greedy company looking to squeeze players even more.</p>

            <p>The Outsiders (AKA Funcom Stockholm) - responsible for Metal Hellsingers and Metal Hellsingers VR - has been impacted by layoffs. As a result, the studio will be closing. The studio consisted of roughly 60 staff <a href="https://www.funcom.com/funcom-stockholm/">according to the official Funcom website</a>.</p>
<p>Through a social media statement posted by The Outsiders founder David Goldfarb, the closure was announced. It reads: "I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing.</p>
<p>"Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled and because of the team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellslinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen."</p>

<p>Goldfarb stated the studio hoped to create something even better, and that the impacted developers want to try to "continue on in some new form". He then requested help, be it through business leads, placement for affected employees, and more.</p><p>This comes shortly after Funcom announced layoffs last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-suffers-layoffs-after-biggest-release-in-studio-history">as the studio declared its intention to focus on Dune: Awakening's ongoing live service support</a>. The full scope of how many employees have been laid off across the full repertoire of Funcom offices remains unclear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Playing Skate makes my knees creak. That’s the weight of remembering Skate the first time around. That’s the weight of expectation heaped on a series that had arguably reached its apex with Skate 3 in 2010. That’s the weight of trepidation at a new, free-to-play business model, in something that’s about vibes, not business. Fortunately for my knees, the longer you spend with Skate, the more you find that it is – in Early Access at least – an ideal way to return to this beloved skateboarding franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early-Access Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Skate is about vibes. It always has been, and that is immediately the most compelling thing about this new version. Out in the city of San Vansterdam, you can do whatever you like. Want to find the best line through an interesting set of benches and plinthes? Go for it. Want to climb to the top of a skyscraper and launch yourself off? You can do that too. Want to just pootle about, listen to music and make your character look cool? That’s also an easy, and welcome, option.</p>


<p>Skate has always acted as an antithesis to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. Time constraints, ridiculous combos, blast furnace locations, are plenty of fun, but they only capture a very slim – and utterly unrealistic – vision of skateboarding. Skate has always aimed to capture the lifestyle – focus on one trick, hanging our with friends, the sheer difficulty of pulling off that one trick – and that’s what you’re getting here.</p>


<p>A lot of that comes down to the control scheme. Skate set out to replicate skateboarding as closely as possible, and its authentic, classic controller scheme is here in full, putting the control of your board almost entirely onto the right analogue stick.</p>
<p>Newcomers may be glad to find that there’s also a refreshed control scheme here too. It’s still based around the right analogue, but it’s more straightforward, and removes a layer of difficulty that has always made Skate the boarding game one for true aficionados. It wouldn’t be in keeping with the scene to gatekeep this skaters’ paradise. That makes this the most welcoming version of Skate, without taking anything away from it. Want the pure, unadulterated experience? That’s still here too.</p>
<p>San Vansterdam is a playground, but it’s also a full, open-world city. There’s cars, stairs and all sorts of other things that aren’t very friendly to skateboarders, and it’s fair to say that your face and the sidewalk are going to become intimately acquainted. You have to learn what kind of surfaces work for you, and the designers have thankfully made sure that there’s more spots here than you can shake a skateboard at. If you’re into skateboarding, it’s almost painful to imagine a location this good for riding. At least you can experience it digitally.</p>

<p>While Skate is freeform, it also gives you lots and lots of things to do. Missions and challenges can be found throughout the city, with the aim being to raise your rep in each area through hitting lines and owning spots. It’s all about earning points, grabbing collectables and maximising the flow of your tricks through particular sections, and it feels great. There’s rewards for most things, and within a couple of hours you’ll have a bunch of clothes and different boards to deck your character out with.</p>
<p>That brings us to the free-to-play element of the game. There are two currencies at play in Skate, one premium one and one earned through gameplay. The premium one can be used in the shop to buy specific branded items, with a rotating selection that changes every day or two. The one you earn through play can be spent on lootboxes, with different areas of the city having different gear. You can see what’s in those loot boxes, but you’ll get a random item when you buy one.</p>
<p>The whole thing reminds me of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, in that it’s completely and utterly superfluous to the game itself, but chances are you’ll end up spending at least a little cash on a cool jumper or the wildest deck in the shop, or maybe splurge on the premium reward track of Season 1. The free stuff is generous enough though, at least in Early Access, and it makes Skate practically essential to check out.</p>

<p>Much was made after the game’s reveal about the more stylised visuals and… well, you don’t notice all that much, except for in those hard-earned replays when you’ve done something really cool. While the boards and clothing all look great, the beards suck, and they look like someone has literally stuck a plastic beard on the front of your face. Here’s hoping that it’s on somebody’s radar.</p>
<p>There are some really nice touches here though. You can grab music from any speaker out in the world – my favourite is grabbing it from a passing car – and add that playlist to your library, with a great variety of music types to go with it, and there’s a nice balance between established artists and underground acts.</p>
<p>The map also shows all the other players on your server and where they’re congregating so you can head straight over there and join in. You can stand and watch others attempting cool tricks or trying to clear a crazy jump, and it just feels like you’re a part of something, part of the community, even if you’re a solo player rather than in a party.</p>

<p>I’ve been waiting for Skate. Tony Hawk’s frantic take on the sport is cool, but it doesn’t feel as good as this. The freedom, the variety, and the community, are already in place, the only thing missing, is you.</p>

<p>"Whether generative AI is involved or not"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ca3bcec3923ed"><a title="Nintendo Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca3bcec3923ed/nintendo-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has posted a short statement denying that it has lobbied the Japanese government on the subject of generative AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220">The post on X</a> was made following a tweet by Japanese politician Satoshi Asano, who originally claimed the company had been lobbying the government on the subject of generative AI.</p>
<p>Here's the full statement, as posted in English following the original Japanese version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI. Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Asano has since deleted his original post and issued apologies, <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974739623692644460">linking to Nintendo’s post in one</a>. Here’s the content of his second post, as translated via X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the content I posted the other day, there was a section with incorrect information, which I have corrected as follows. I deeply regret my own failure to verify the facts adequately. I would like to apologize once again to all related parties and will strive to prevent any recurrence. Additionally, regarding the original post that contained the incorrect information, it has been confirmed that it is being disseminated again after appearing in X's trends, so to prevent the further spread of information that differs from the facts and to avoid causing any more trouble, I have just deleted it. Once again, I will take this as a lesson and make use of it moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comes as controversial generative AI technology is being used increasingly in the field of game development, and soon after Open AI’s Sora 2 went online and was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">quickly filled with unofficial video clips</a> created via user prompts featuring Nintendo characters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-bowser-comments-on-ai-and-its-uses">Back in April</a>, on the topic of generative AI, NOA president Doug Bowser said: "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers, their artistic capabilities and their insight into how people play, so there's always, always, going to be a human touch and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake Born From a Wish DLC and the Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are likely to be announced soon, according to a known insider.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Speaking on X</a>, Dusk Golem, who correctly provided news regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-transmission-announcements/">the revival of the KONAMI survival horror series</a> before the official announcement, stated that new announcements regarding last year's remake of the second entry in the series, including the remade higly-requested DLC expansion, the Xbox Series X|S versions and a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch to address <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/">some of the issues still found in this version of the game</a> shouldn't be too far off in the future. The announcements are likely being tied to the promotional cycle and release window of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is based on the second entry in the series and will launch on January 23, 2026.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) Silent Hill 2 Remake, the PS5 Pro patch likely be timed with some announcements, Born From a Wish DLC should be announced sooner or later, &amp; likely Konami is tying it around the window of the upcoming Return to Silent Hill movie based off SH2.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1975058939093078093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As Dusk Golem's track record isn't spotless, we have to take today's statements with a massive grain of salt. At the same time, the Silent Hill 2 remake official website was updated over the past few days in a way that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nyr5z9/in_bloober_teams_website_silent_hill_2_remakes/"> suggests the remake could launch on other formats in the future</a>, so there's little doubt that KONAMI and Bloober Team are likely gearing up for some announcement, in light of the game's PS5 console exclusivity ending on October 8.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake launching on other gaming systems is good news, as the remake developed by Bloober Team is a game that any survival horror fan should experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outsiders, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-hellsinger-rock-on/">rhythm FPS game Metal: Hellsinger</a>, has been shut down as part of Funcom's <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">recently confirmed layoffs</a>. Funcom's Stockholm studio has also been impacted as part of the cuts, though it's unclear if the entire branch has been shuttered as well.</p>



<p>Former studio creative director and founder David Goldfarb <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955">confirmed the news in a statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, saying, "<em>I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm</em> <em>have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Many of us have survived</em> <em>a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled, and because of this team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellsinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</em></p>



<p><em>We had hoped to do something even better this time - things don't always go the way you hope. But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting. Thanks so much</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Goldfarb also posted the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/locust9_friends-i-have-not-had-much-time-to-process-activity-7380961160872841216-XIbs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">same statement to his LinkedIn account</a>, where he added that writing the statement "<em>sucked</em>" and that he was "<em>afraid to press post because it will make it real. Oh well.</em>"</p>



<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">acquired The Outsiders back in 2021</a>, while the two studios were already working on Metal: Hellsinger with Funcom as the game's publisher. The studio had been independent for six years before being acquired.</p>



<p>When the layoffs at Funcom were confirmed last week, Funcom did not initially say how many developers were impacted. According <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">to The Outsiders' official website,</a> at least 30 developers were employed at the Sweden-based studio. </p>



<p>In Funcom's statement regarding its layoffs, it claimed that its new survival MMO, Dune: Awakening, was "<em></em><em>the biggest release we've had in our 32-year-long history of making great games</em>." The cuts were made due to Funcom deciding it did not need the same number of developers as work on Dune: Awakening transitioned from developing for launch to maintaining it and creating new content.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-denies-generative-ai-government-lobbying.1317550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese gaming giant Nintendo has denied lobbying its native country's government over generative AI, although the company does say that it intends to continue taking action against anything it perceives as intellectual property infringement.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Nintendo says that it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" regarding generative AI, "contrary to recent discussions on the internet". The studio closes by saying it will "continue to take necessary actions" against IP infringement, "whether generative AI is involved or not".</p>

<p>The message was seemingly posted in response to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-apparently-lobbying-japanese-government-in-fight-against-generative-ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a>&nbsp;(thanks, Nintendo Everything) by Japanese House of Representatives politician Satoshi Asano, who said that Nintendo "avoids using generative AI to protect its IP" and that the company was "engaging in lobbying activities with the government".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=dcJTiuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=qrNQ3PWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has, in fact, not been lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Asano himself apologized for the inaccuracy of his original statement and the misleading information contained within, posting a lengthy explanation and apology <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974812318761631821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on his X account</a>. He's also deleted the original post in order to "prevent further dissemination of inaccurate information" (according to machine translation).</p>

<p>If Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI, though, it likely wouldn't come as much of a surprise, given the company's past statements about the controversial technology.</p>

<p>Back in July last year, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">said it had no plans</a> to utilize generative AI during any of its development processes, with president Shuntaro Furukawa pointing to "issues with intellectual property rights" and the responsibility of Nintendo to "deliver value" as sticking points.</p>

<p>The legendary gaming company is famously hawkish when it comes to pursuing legal action over its intellectual property. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing</a> Pocketpair, the creator of survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">patent infringement</a>, and it's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">aggressive</a> on the legal field in this regard <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">before</a>, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=nrT_JqIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=yFsqkjbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you want to know how protective Nintendo is over its IP rights, ask the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's stance on generative AI puts it at odds with many of its peers, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton</a>, streaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, and fellow gaming titans <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, among others.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo isn't the only gaming luminary to express doubts about generative AI; others, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow"><em>BioShock</em>'s Ken Levine</a>, have also evinced skeptical positions on the tech, so Nintendo is far from alone in being cautious.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft ramped up the price of its current-gen consoles. The 512GB Xbox Series S jumped up from $300 to $380, with all the models above it seeing similar price hikes. Well, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft is at it again</a> as the company decided to tack on an extra $20 to make it an even $400 as of October 3. This comes alongside the announcement that the various levels of Xbox Game Pass are getting some light rebranding along with, you guessed it, price increases. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">However, looks like someone forgot to tell Amazon because right now, you can score the 512GB Xbox Series S for just $329.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">This Xbox gaming consoles comes packed with one controller and an internal storage of 512GB</a>. A full 1TB version is available but that one is not on sale at the moment. This game system is disc-free meaning all the games you play will need to be downloaded onto the consoles or onto an external SSD which can be purchased separately. Some games are avail to be streamed from the cloud with the right Game Pass subscription as well.</p>
<p>The console does not support 4K gaming, but it still produces a resolution higher than the standard HD, rendering at 1440p. Through apps and streaming subscriptions like Netflix, HBO MAc, and Disney Plus, you can enjoy TV and movies in full 4K. It’s got HDR support to really make sure those dark spots stay dark and that vibrant colors brightly pop. A game like the newly released <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> looks awesome in HDR on a proper screen as so much of that game exists in solid black areas with radiant colors sprinkled throughout.</p>



<p>You can even play&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>for free with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. This does come with the small caveat of that price jump announced earlier this week. The top tier of this video game subscription service just went up from $20 a month to $30. A 50% price increase to the premiere game service alongside price increased for consoles across the board doesn’t exactly feel great. There are however some great titles on the Essential tier of Game Pass which is just $10 per month. On that tier you’ll find games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>,&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tunic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>. You may not be getting day one first party launches there but there is a deep treasure trove of awesome titles waiting to be played.</p>

                <p>A vulnerability found in the Unity game engine has led to studio Obsidian Entertainment taking down five of its games, including the premium edition of its 2025 release Avowed.</p><p>The Unity issue, discovered in June and <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patched on October 2</a>, could have allowed "local code execution and access to confidential information on end user devices running unity-built applications," reads an advisory on the <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Unity website</a>.

			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">multiplayer beta is officially live</a> as of this past weekend and open to the entire public as of yesterday, October 5. When it launched, even in its early access state, reports began appearing online that <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-already-running-amuck/">cheaters were already running amuck throughout the beta</a>. </p>



<p>As we come out of the early access period and into the all-public period of the beta, Activision updated players on the state of cheaters in a long post on <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1974942752485077132">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where it claimed that it was catching "<em>97% of cheaters</em>" within "<em>30 minutes of their first sign-in</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Cheaters were expected</em>," Team Ricochet writes. "<em>But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match.</em> <em>You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta. We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat defenses will only grow stronger</em>."</p>



<p>The post continues with Team Ricochet and Activision not only claiming that 97% of cheaters were caught within half an hour, but that "<em>fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes</em>."</p>



<p>Team Ricochet also went on to say that it is bringing the fight directly to cheat vendors and that is has "<em>directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since Black Ops 6 launched</em>. <em>Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will purse them beyond in-game enforcement</em>."</p>



<p>While players would generally agree it's a good thing that cheaters aren't overrunning and ruining their multiplayer experience, there are still many who aren't happy about the kernel-level protection Activision has pushed to make this work. To those players, Team Ricochet simply said, "<em>We</em> <em>understand that new security measures like TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot checks can sometimes feel disruptive. But these steps help ensure a secure, fair experience for every player, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we strengthen PC protections.</em>"</p>



<p>Whether what Activision and Team Ricochet lines up with your experience in the multiplayer beta or not, it's clear that Activision is trying to send a message to players that it is taking cheaters in Call of Duty very seriously. But that only works if these numbers and any future cheater reports Team Ricochet puts out accurately represent the state of the multiplayer experience on Call of Duty.</p>



<p>The first comments below this post include players <a href="https://x.com/tq57l/status/1975065774730735927">claiming they were shadowbanned when they weren't cheating</a>, players pointing out that <a href="https://x.com/JediJoystick/status/1975040453067284798">reactive measures don't do enough to stop cheaters from ruining a player's multiplayer experience</a>, that the wording in this statement <a href="https://x.com/ItsMeChalks/status/1974955542453026903">only refers to the cheaters Team Ricochet were able to detect</a>, and others <a href="https://x.com/ShutUpBruv1/status/1975056289949753564">claiming that they've still seen scores of cheaters in their matches</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, if you haven't seen cheaters in your matches, and by your experience, the anti-cheat system is working, you might be too busy having fun in the beta to comment on these posts. Spending any significant amount of time on the internet will teach you that people will complain more than they'll speak up about how good things are going.</p>



<p>And while Activision and Team Ricochet are putting on a strong face against cheaters currently, the true test will be how the game looks in six months, and if cheating is still as significant an issue as it's been in previous years. </p>



<p>"<em>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge - and we're committed to leading the charge,</em>" Team Ricochet and Activision write. "<em>We continue to bring new systems online during beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights. We're dedicated to transparency, community feedback, and constant evolution in our fight for fair play</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo 15.6″ Laptop (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) Crashes to Nearly Free After 82% Cut, Early Prime Day Exclusive]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-giving-away-this-brand-new-loaded-2199-lenovo-laptop-for-practically-nothing-2000631661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-15-6%E2%80%B3-laptop-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-crashes-to-nearly-free-after-82-cut-early-prime-day-exclusive.1317496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When is something both overpriced and a massive bargain? When it’s a brand-new 15.6-inch FHD Lenovo laptop with an Intel N4500 processor, and Windows 11 Professional pre-installed, and it has a kinda-crazy original price tag that’s marked down in a <em>huge</em> way at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">This limited-time deal knocks 82% from the (overpriced) $2,199 original cost to a (massive bargain) $400.</a></p>
<p>Toss that original price and look at what the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 packs into a $400 package, and the quality of this Amazon deal becomes obvious very quickly. Simply, this is a stalwart everyday laptop that can handle serious work while giving you ample options to play. Lenovo’s longstanding reputation for building durable laptops enhances the broad appeal of the IdeaPad 1 for professionals, students, or just casual PC users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid as a Rock</h2>
<p>From end to end, everything about the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 speaks to absolute reliability. There are faster laptops, there are laptops with more memory than the IdeaPad 1’s 16GB of RAM and more storage than the IdeaPad 1’s 512GB — although both are easily and inexpensively expanded — and there are laptops with bigger and more spectacular displays. But the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 isn’t lacking anywhere — the Intel Celeron N4500 processor can reach 2.8GHz in speed, the FHD display (1920 x 1080 resolution) has anti-glare treatment, and the Intel UHD Graphics chip pairs with the monitor to deliver a solid and reliable performance.</p>
<p>When it’s time to put the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 to the test with a video conference or video call, it comes ready with a 720p HD webcam with built-in Privacy Shutter, and two Dolby Audio speakers. The rest of your everyday productivity is made easy by the preloaded Windows 11 Professional OS, which includes Microsoft Copilot for an ultra-fast AI assist whenever you need it.</p>



<h2>Connections For All</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 has all the connections you need, and perhaps even more. Start with the Wi-Fi 6 11ax 2×2 and Bluetooth 5.2 hookups that make your browsing and streaming life a cinch, and the USB ports — a 2.0 Type-A, a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C for fast data transfers — HDMI 1.4b port, and card reader present all the options you need for peripherals and external monitors.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure who came up with the original $2,199 price tag on this Lenovo 15.6-inch IdeaPad 1. It’s certainly not a price we’d ever recommend for an exceptionally solid and reliable laptop from a leading manufacturer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">But for just $400 after Amazon’s jaw-dropping 82%-off limited-time discount? </a>We’re all in on that.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In June, NateTheHate 2 stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/">Red Dead Redemption 2 was headed to Switch 2</a> this year (in addition to the current-gen updates). The leaker nailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-could-happen-very-soon/1100-6534399/">when a Nintendo Direct would happen last month</a>, though Red Dead Redemption 2 didn't make an appearance at that event. Previously, Rockstar brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-nintendo-switch-and-ps4-next-week-with-ps5-compatibility/1100-6516620/">Red Dead Redemption to Switch in 2023</a>. There have also been rumblings about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">a possible GTA 4 remaster</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#6">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west/1900-6417019/">Red Dead Redemption 2 review</a>.

This year, I've received a surprising number of requests from developers and PR teams that had me morphing into everybody's favorite blinker-in-chief. Shout out to Drew Scanlon.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those requests took the form of senior figures or account managers at PR firms asking me to edit published articles and cut remarks they or their clients made during interviews. Some of those chats took place over email. Others were held in-person at major industry events. In each instance, however, they were conversations that both myself and my interviewees had agreed would be on the record.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does that phrase mean, precisely? According to 'Writing &amp; Reporting for the Media' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780190200886/student/chapter10/gline/level/">(via Oxford University Press</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">): "'On the record' attribution means that everything the source says may be published and quoted directly, and the source may be fully identified by name and title."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It sounds straightforward enough, but the even shorter version is this: If you agree to an on-the-record chinwag with a journalist, every single word you say could be published.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is something I'm increasingly convinced a lot of developers and PR teams do not truly appreciate, perhaps because out-and-out video game journalists are a dying breed. I'm not taking potshots at content creators or influencers here, but our circles do not overlap.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/book-excerpt-online-community" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: Mastering Community Management: Chaos, Compassion, and Connections in Games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm not going to put anybody on blast for reaching out because I believe most of the requests I received were sent in good faith, but it's vital developers and PR representatives understand the nature of on-the-record interviews and, more broadly, the role of journalists within the video game industry.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Journalists might be friendly—but they are not your friends">Journalists might be friendly—but they are not your friends</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first difficult truth to acknowledge on our collective journey might ruffle feathers, but I strongly believe this is where the problem starts.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers: journalists are not your friends.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They aren't even your peers. Journalists are hired to scrutinize and report on the video game industry. In my role as a trade reporter, that means attempting to disseminate information that's relevant to our audience at Game Developer. Sometimes that means publishing investigative pieces or reporting on layoffs to hold corporations to account. On other occasions it might be penning a deep dive into a certain game mechanic or interviewing a founder about the direction of their next lofty business endeavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have no doubt that in the process of speaking with journalists you might build a friendly rapport. I've had many a pleasant conversation with people whose work I've enjoyed, but there is a fundamental divide that must always be acknowledged. I am here to report on the video game industry. You are working within it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-happens-when-a-colossus-like-silksong-scuppers-your-launch-plans-" target="_self" data-discover="true">What happens when a colossus like Silksong scuppers your launch plans?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No matter how cordial our correspondence, there might come a time when I have to report on you, your product, or your company in a way you no longer find beneficial or flattering. That is the job. Reporters are not an extension of your marketing department. We are not there to promote you, your product, or tailor headlines to meet your specific needs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Acknowledge this before you agree to an interview. Let the truth wash over you like a salve. You'll be better off for it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you haven't had any media training, get some. Prepare thoroughly for interviews. Understand who you are going to be speaking to. Are they a consumer journalist, whose audience will more likely be the people who play your games? Are they a trade journalist more interested in the business and craft of making video games? Once you have that information, consider how you might discuss a range of topics given the context of your conversation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are you chatting shortly after your video game launched to millions of sales and critical acclaim? Perhaps it sunk like a lead balloon and the future of your studio is now uncertain? Or maybe your parent company just signed a deal with one of those controversial conglomerates that seem to be everywhere lately? Take into account all of the above and ensure you're fully equipped to deal with all lines of questioning—including those that might be more critical.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/xbox-explains-how-devs-can-make-the-most-of-streaming-showcase-spots" target="_self" data-discover="true">How developers can make the most of streaming showcases</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you'd like support, have a PR representative assist with interviews.

If you'd like to provide context off record or on background, specify that during the interview or beforehand. It will be down to the reporter to decide whether to agree to that request, but you should at the very least pose the question.

I'm not unsympathetic to the requests I have received. I do not revel in the notion of publishing stories that leave people open to criticism or land them in hot water. And yet my job is to ask (sometimes difficult) questions and report what I hear.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> players hopping into the beta right now are taking in all the sights of Activision's upcoming AAA FPS, though one thing they won't be able to see is the name of another massive release coming out this year. That's because the words: "Arc Raiders" are censored in the game's chat function.</p>
<p>Censoring words in-game isn't anything new, and is usually used to block out profanity, toxic terminology, and other potentially offensive words from multiplayer lobbies. Blocking out game names is a strange one though, especially given the fact that Black Ops 7's biggest competitor this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is not censored. It's worth noting the words "Arc" and "Raiders" on their own don't get censored, it's only when you put them both together where censoring occurs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1nyombu/arc_raiders_being_censored_in_the_black_ops_7/">A clip of this censorship in-action has been circulating online</a>, and Eurogamer confirmed that the term Arc Raiders is starred out in the Black Ops 7 beta. Funnily enough, Arc Raiders players found the term "Arc Raiders" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">also got automatically censored from the EA App chat feature</a>, while other game names like Call of Duty did not. This was quickly patched out once publicised.</p>

<p>Aside from this small, peculiar quirk, the Call of Duty beta seems to be going down rather well. Over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trials-new-more-varied-matchmaking-and-tweaks-ttk-on-popular-weapons">new tweaks and game modes were added to the game</a> to the joy of its community, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">while there were initial reports of cheaters running rampant</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-cheaters-banned-within-30-minutes-activision-claims">Activision has claimed the vast majority of them have been dealt with</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to release on the 14th November, so this early taste of the game is meant to test features out and tide the ravenous FPS community over until next month. Arc Raiders, on the other hand, is set to release on the 30th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">and has an open beta on the weekend starting the 17th October</a>. It's brilliant fun and well worth trying out, at least if the first beta was any indication of quality.</p>
