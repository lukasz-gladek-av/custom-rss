            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting its Q1 2025 financial results</a>, Ubisoft revealed that Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to perform well. After reaching 3 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of March</a>, the game has now surpassed 5 million unique players, who have collectively performed 2 billion stealth kills, traveled 1 billion kilometers, and petted 38 million animals. However, the publisher's quarterly financial results still reported lower than anticipated net bookings, mostly due to issues with Rainbow Six Siege, as noted in the below statement by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot:</p>



<p><em>The first quarter delivered mixed results. On the positive side, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than 5 million unique players since its launch, and Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth. However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also noted that the other two causes for the lower net bookings include a 'partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2 and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact'.</p>



<p>Guillemot then added that Ubisoft will continue creating so-called Creative Houses. The hope is that these business units will boost creative vision and business performance. The first one is, of course, the subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year, which is set to oversee the Rainbow Six, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed franchise. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> recently, it will be led by Christopher Derennes and Yves Guillemot's own son.</p>



<p>As for the Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion, Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft only reiterated that it's coming in their fiscal Q2 and will offer more than 10 hours of new content, as well as a new weapon, skills, and abilities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it might launch as early as September, although if that's truly the case, an official announcement will have to be made soon by the publisher.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-gets-new-beta-update-as-bethesda-reiterates-%E2%80%98exciting-things%E2%80%99-are-on-the-way.1250661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1947686948799389848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new beta update for Starfield on Steam. As usual, interested users can check it out by selecting the beta build in the game's tab via the Steam library. This is, however, a minor patch, as you can easily glean from the changelog:</p>



<p><strong><em>General</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Minor improvements to format and display in Creations menus.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed an issue that could cause that Extreme Temperature gear to appear incorrectly.</em></li>



<li><em>Minor improvements to sorting in the Missions Menu.</em></li>



<li><em>General crash and stability fixes.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>More interesting is the fact that Bethesda has reiterated its promise that 'exciting things' are on the way to Starfield, and more details about those will be revealed 'in the coming months'. The development studio had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> as much back in March, following a fairly long period of silence. </p>



<p>Game Director Todd Howard had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the sci-fi roleplaying game would receive annual story expansions. However, the lack of any such announcement and today's reiteration that it will take months before we hear about those exciting new things all but confirms the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumor</a> that the second expansion won't launch in 2025 after all.</p>



<p>This could perhaps be tied to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly delayed PlayStation 5 port</a>. Bethesda might want to bundle a second expansion when the game launches on Sony's console. Another side is that the developers are possibly trying to deliver a more impactful expansion after the underwhelming Shattered Space, which got a middling reception, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6/10 score here</a> from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</em></p>

Firstly, the game will run at "mostly around 30fps", with some supposed dips during more intense moments.</p>
<p>This reportedly follows previous comments from Pitchford about how the <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/borderlands-4-is-targeting-60-fps-gearbox-ceo-addresses-balance-concerns">new entry was aiming for 60fps on consoles</a> – with the final decision about the frame rate in the Switch 2 version apparently based on the developer not wanting to "cut anything", including cross-play support.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-1ksWY9W4EA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed39956flqpmnt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ksWY9W4EA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Randy Pitchford:</strong> "It was important to us to not cut anything and to support cross play with other platforms. So, no. It'll be mostly around 30 fps, with some dips in some intense moments, heavy combat or if hosting a multiplayer game in handheld mode, etc."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to this, it's also been confirmed the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 will require a download "even for physical copies" of the game – so expect a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>And as for the current <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/borderlands_3_ultimate_edition">Borderlands 3</a> performance issues on Switch 2, when asked about this, Pitchford noted how this title was obviously not made to run on the Switch 2. Gearbox will supposedly need "some help" and "some time" to see what it can do with this in the future, but for now, the focus is on Borderlands 4.</p>

<p>Following an update earlier this month, Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> has now been updated to Version 1.03.</p>
<p>This latest update includes improvements to Chapter 2, 3 and 4, along with various other changes. This includes multiple fixes across each chapter, including some softlock fixes, and there are also some fixes tied to minor graphical errors.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/" rel="noopener">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune Version 1.03</h3>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<ul>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a softlock in the part where you catch mice in a basket on your head.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Swords used in a certain boss’s “Sword Tunnel” attack now have a reduced hit box relative to the graphic, making the attack easier to dodge.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock on the Board 1 that could occur after using only three keys.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft lock if a party member fails to reach the Power Croissant.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash if you pushed a pyramid the wrong way.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where on certain platforms, the sprites of the game would become blurry after the Tenna scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<ul>
<li>If you lose to Jackenstein 2 times in a row, the amount of damage that the chasing pumpkin deals will be halved. If you lose 3 times in a row, TP gain will be increased by 50%. These changes will allow players who find this battle difficult to progress past it more easily.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock which could occur if the tutu was not returned to you.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where normal battle music would not play if you fought Mike at the beginning of the game. (This issue becomes resolved after fighting Jackenstein.)</li>

<li>Fixed an impossible note on the song “Knock you Down!!” in the rhythm game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Kris would still appear to be wearing their church clothes even though they’d been removed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where asking Ralsei advice for a puzzle would simply result in him saying a single button.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing octaves on the giant piano organ thing could freeze the game.</li>
<li>Susie and Ralsei no longer erroneously appear in the rhythm game at Castle Town at the end of the Chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various Chapters</p>
<ul>
<li>[Console-only] Fixed an issue where changing the language setting would also change the border setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the intro prophecy would always be skipped after selecting a chapter using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed a few minor textual errors.</li>
<li>Fixed various minor graphical errors.</li>
<li>Various other minor fixes.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a great time to be a fan of soulslikes. Between the fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-berserker-khazan-review"><u>The First Berserker: Khazan</u></a> earlier in the year, the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-review"><u>Lies of P: Overture DLC</u></a> last month, and the multiplayer/co-op focused <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring: Nightreign</u></a>, we have been eating well in 2025 – and you can add Wuchang: Fallen Feathers as yet another course in that meal. This debut game from developer Leenzee Games impressed me from the start with its exciting, fast-paced, and dynamic combat. It also has one of the best skill trees in the genre, along with intricate and interconnected level design that guides us through gorgeous vistas and grotesque sights in equal measure. That said, its difficulty is all over the place, with truly wild dips and spikes that go from a relative walk in the park, to “oh my god, when is it my turn to attack?!” levels of aggression in some of its later bosses. So while I’m left with a little whiplash after beating it, it’s still an easy strong recommendation for anybody who’s hungry for more.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In typical soulslike fashion, Wuchang expects you to do the heavy lifting when it comes to piecing together its story and lore – but it’s not handled quite as elegantly as a FromSoft game or something like Lies of P. I was actually on board for the intriguing opening, which shows our titular, mostly silent hero awaken in a cave to discover she has a disease that robs those afflicted of their memories and gradually turns them into hideous monsters. What starts as a personal journey to discover who she is and cure her affliction before she mutates into a nasty bird beast turns into a descent into dark fantasy as the mysteries of the disease, known as The Feathering, start to come to light and you do battle with those transfigured by its effects. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Lore fiends who enjoy digging into item descriptions might get more out of the story. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That was a good start, but by the end of its 45-hour campaign, I’d lost track of the many characters who pop up, say a few lines of dialogue, and then disappear for 10 or so hours until they pop up again in a completely new location. People kept referencing names that I’d never heard of before, making it impossible for me to follow the conversation. Lore fiends who enjoy digging into weapon and item descriptions for clues might get more out of the story than I did, but playing through it the same way I have many other games meant its big revelations largely fell flat. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Game of Skills</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, though, had the flexibility and depth to carry me through to the end in style, with a ton of different offensive and defensive options at my disposal at all times. Where Wuchang sets itself apart from others that use the familiar stamina-fueled light and heavy attacks to get you from checkpoint to checkpoint is its huge focus on combining the skills and abilities that are tied to your weapons with Discipline skills you unlock on the absolutely massive skill tree. For instance, equipping the sword parry Discipline skill while using the Flamebringer Longsword weapon will let you build up the burn status ailment with its Infernal Firebrand Weapon Skill while also giving you a defensive counter option on top of that. Or you could pair that same weapon with something like Crescent Moon, which still gives you that same burn build ability, but also allows you to get in and then get out to avoid counter attacks all together while still being able to build Skybound Might with it’s built in evade. On top of that, you can swap between two weapons mid-fight, even mid-combo, which doubles your options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good that you have these extra options, too, because this is not a game where you can get by with just the basics, especially when it comes to the tougher fights. Powering your skills and spells hinges on generating a resource known as Skyborn Might, which is gained mostly by perfectly dodging enemy attacks at the last instant, but can also be gained in certain weapon-specific ways, such as landing the fourth hit of a light combo string with the Axe, the second hit of a light combo string with the Longsword, clashing weapons with the dual blades, or automatically over time simply by having the one-handed sword equipped.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I felt like I usually had more interesting decisions to make with each level up than I do in most soulslikes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I had a blast discovering ways to incorporate both Weapon and Discipline skills into combat to get around limitations like stamina, since using a Skyborn Might charge often gives you a powerful attack that doesn’t deplete your meter, or lets you blow through an enemy’s strong defense with a poise break-afflicting mist and take huge chunks out of their health in seconds. I felt like I usually had more interesting decisions to make with each level up than I do in most soulslikes when it came to defining my build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A big part of that is how instead of just boosting your preferred stat and making numbers go up each time you get enough currency to level, Wuchang uses a progression system that resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X and Salt and Sanctuary. It has six paths to go down and unlock progressively more powerful skills, with five being devoted to stat and weapon upgrades enhancing each of the different types of armaments, and the last one focusing more on more universal boons, like extra healing charges, general buffs for executing certain techniques, etc. The grid is absolutely gigantic, and even 20 or 30 hours into the 45-hour campaign I was still unlocking brand-new branches with new Discipline skills and tons more upgrades to choose from. That’s a lot, but thankfully respecs are free, allowing you the freedom to change up your entire build with zero cost or penalty, whether to simply try out a new weapon or alter your game plan against a challenging boss. It’s an excellent system that encourages experimentation while also rewarding you for having a clear idea of what kind of build you want to make.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a fairly impressive amount of different types of enemies as well, with each area you visit packing plenty of new twisted creatures with a brand-new set of attacks and skills that you’ll need to learn how to adjust your build and your tactics to deal with. Everything in this game can be threatening: from the small hunchbacked dudes that go down in just one or two hits, but can sneak up on you with a hugely damaging grab, to the towering fiends that are almost like minibosses unto themselves. This variety kept the action fresh throughout the whole adventure and kept me tense whenever I would venture in a new area, since I never knew what to expect around the corner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bumpy Roads</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first 10 or so hours, though, I didn’t have to do a ton of build tweaking to breeze through most of these fights. That wasn’t to say that it was a walk in the park, but I’ve played a lot of soulslikes in my day, and once I got the hang of dodging through the last hit of an enemy combo and charging up a heavy attack to instantly stagger them, I initially felt like I had figured Wuchang out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deaths that I did experience mostly came from an abundance of some cheap-feeling “gotcha” moments like: <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, lots of soulslikes have moments like these, but in Wuchang it happens with such frequency that it felt like I was getting constantly pranked by the developers – and at a certain point that joke gets old.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that, it was mostly smooth sailing until I came across a boss called Commander Honglan. She wasn’t so much a difficulty spike, because that implies at least some degree of an incline or ramp up, as she was like running into a brick wall. She took me about two hours to beat, and while I still came out on the other side of it having mostly enjoyed the intensity of the fight, Honglan serves as a non-spoilery encapsulation of what I don’t like about several of Wuchang’s later boss fights. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honglan wasn't so much a difficulty spike, because that implies at least some degree of an incline or ramp up. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest issue is that the punishment window for correctly and precisely dodging most of their attacks is super tight, which takes away from the satisfaction of actually being able to dodge a huge sequence of swings. Compare that to games like Sekiro or Khazan, where you’re damaging the boss’s posture bar every time you precisely block an attack, getting closer to being able to do a damaging critical hit once you completely drain it. There’s no such satisfying mid-fight progress here, because perfect dodges just give you Skyborn Might charges, which you still need to find an opening to be able to use. Wuchang does have a posture meter on enemies, but it only increases when you land hits and decreases after a time if you don’t, which makes it extremely difficult to get that reward for nuanced aggression when your opportunities to deal damage are so minimal and so fleeting. Not every boss fight after Honglan is like this, but the ones that are feel very drawn out to a degree that diminishes their fun. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Dark Descent</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The world all of these ups and downs take place in is rich with secrets to discover, interconnected paths that satisfyingly link entire sections of the map together, and tough optional challenges with appropriate rewards. I loved the gradual descent into dark fantasy – you begin in a very colorful and beautiful Chinese village that is <em>just </em>showing subtle signs of the terrible illness sweeping through its population, and then as you progress deeper underground and through areas that have been absolutely ravaged by The Feathering it starts to feel more and more like a horror game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also some really cleverly put together sequences that create tension and chaos even without combat being involved. One example is a section where you start on a straightaway with an enemy at the end who builds up an instant-killing status affliction called Despair just by looking at you. To evade his gaze and get through, I had to make a mad dash past a bunch of enemies, climb up a ramp while avoiding poisonous drops from the ceiling, and navigate around constantly spawning tough monsters that were created by another out-of-reach foe. It’s a great example of strong enemy design meshing with clever level design to create an absolutely intense sprint through a dangerous environment.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review.1250583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The ancient mythological world depicted by Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a fascinating one. Set during the late Ming Period, an era of great sweeping change in China when ineffective leadership resulted in famine, rebellion, and war, the game is also imbued with mythological elements inspired by the amazing discoveries found in the Sanxingdui archaeological site. Some of these bronze relics featured mysterious half-bird half-human creatures, leading to the concept of ‘Feathering Disease’ that provides the basis for the game’s story. This horrific plague transforms those poor saps afflicted into hideous, mutated beasts, rampaging around the place and leaving chaos in their wake. That’s where the player steps in, cast as Bai Wuchang – a butt-kicking pirate – they must cut their way through hordes of demons to save the people of the land in this third-person action Soulslike.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMMMNGV9LqI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s just one problem for Wuchang as she embarks on her quest: she’s gone and caught herself the Feathering Disease too. Thankfully, like a dose of man flu, it doesn’t seem that bad for her. Sure, Wuchang starts to get a bit feathery and her eyes turn red, but that’s about it. The disease seems to just vanish, only to turn up again later for reasons unknown. In fact, this is one of the main issues that I had in my time with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, as I had absolutely no idea what was going on. In part, this is due to poor translation, the game failing to explain its core mechanics effectively, but it’s also due to many of those mechanics seemingly not being implemented fully, perhaps due to time or budget.</p>


<p>There’s a suggestion that the Feathering Disease will corrupt you, turn you into a mindless, murderous Big Bird, but that never comes to pass. Die and respawn a few times and the disease will disappear, your symptoms abating. Apparently, you deal more damage yet are more vulnerable when the disease is rampant in your body, yet I never noticed any tangible difference.</p>
<p>There are various items to collect that will ease your feathering, shrines to pray at to relieve your symptoms, but these are seemingly irrelevant, I never needed to use any of them, not once. More confusingly, the few survivors you meet don’t seem concerned in the slightest about your mutation, barely reacting to your glowing red evil eyes and feathery protrusions. It’s strange that so much fuss is made about Wuchang being afflicted by the Feathering Disease, so many mechanics and items devoted to managing it, and yet it’s so easily ignored.</p>


<p>What you are left with, without the intrigue of the Feathering Disease, is a bog-standard Soulslike. You wander around the maze-like environment, killing creatures, finding the bonfire-like shrines, and dying on numerous occasions to a big bad boss. Rinse and repeat. Combat, for the most part, is flat, uninspired, and oddly dull. This is mostly down to the enemies you face, which, despite intriguing designs, are made up of the same muddy brown textures as the environment around them. You face a handful of enemy types again and again, each using the same two or three attack combos at their disposal ad infinitum. The AI is dumb to a hilarious extent, enemies often failing to get through doorways, falling off cliffs to try to reach you, or getting trapped behind very small objects in an endless loop of walking-animation.</p>
<p>Wuchang can find a variety of weapons to use, but most of them are absolutely pants, with weird attack patterns that serve no discernible purpose. Indeed, I just stuck with the basic sword from beginning to end, with no real need to swap it out. Unlockable spells and special attacks are at Wuchang’s disposal, but the visuals that accompany their use are lacklustre and strangely understated, lacking the bombastic energy they would need to alleviate the combat tedium that soon sets in. Again, most of the specials are simply unnecessary and ineffective. The standard blink attack works the best and will serve you well enough without needing to even give the others a try.</p>

<p>Occasionally Wuchang: Fallen Feathers can be very pretty with wide-open vistas spreading far into the distance, but most of the time it insists you hang out in dreary caves and identikit villages. The level design is confused and unclear, not helped by samey visual assets being reused, leading to me getting lost. A lot. Not in the fun kind of lost that you feel when you are exploring a fascinatingly complex and mysterious virtual world, but where you just can’t find your way out of a teeny temple. More problematically, the game is borderline unplayable at times on PS5 due to gnarly lag and framerate drops in anything but Performance Mode, and even then, it still drags its heels on occasion.</p>
<p>Boss fights are by far the best part of the game. These hulking grotesque behemoths are much more interesting to fight than the multitudes of foe fodder that precedes them, with genuinely challenging attack patterns to overcome. Even here though, there are problems. All too often when bosses attack, they get distracted and attack the thin air around you because, well, they’ve been driven mad by the feathering disease I suppose? Or is it some naff AI rearing its unwanted head again?</p>

<p>Collison detection is questionable too, bosses causing damage despite missing you entirely. This is a problem throughout the game, with attacks rarely cancelling each other out, meaning both you and your foe lose health, even though you hit them first. The frustrating part is, they cause way more damage than you do.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is an intriguing ideal spoiled by poor implementation, with nearly every aspect of the game needing a thorough reworking. This is a game that required way more time in development before seeing the light of day.</p>

<p>Following Mario Kart World's launch in June</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Toadette - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/873c1c5d48a98/toadette-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it's clear the restrictions on the voice actor reveals for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> have officially lifted at this point, and more of the talent is now revealing who they played in the Switch 2 launch title.</p>
<p>Following the update on Peach yesterday (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/princess-peachs-new-voice-actor-has-been-confirmed">and also who voiced the NPC Toads in the game</a>), we've now got the confirmation of the <em>main</em> Toad's voice actor. This character is played by Laila Berzins and was formerly voiced by Samantha Kelly. Berzins has been credited on projects like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/genshin_impact">Genshin Impact</a></strong> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> series.</p>
<p>The voice actor officially confirmed this in an announcement on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am overjoyed to be able to finally announce that I voice Toad in Mario Kart World. Being a part of such an iconic franchise, let alone one of my favorite characters is a dream come true.</p>
<p>I am so inspired by the magnificient Toads before me; Jen Taylor and Samantha Kelley. The gaming community owes them a huge debt of gratitude for the years they've spent bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>I hope to do this little mushroom proud! He’s a fun guy! Get it? Fungi? Anyway…Immensely grateful to Nintendo America and cupofteastudios. Here we go!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, Laura Stahl has confirmed she's playing Toadette in Mario Kart World. She's previously played roles in series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_engage">Fire Emblem</a> (Alear) and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> series. Here's what she had to say about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peeking out of a social media hiatus to share that I am the voice of Toadette in Mario Kart World! grateful to @Cupofteaprod and @NintendoAmerica for the opportunity! I'm still in disbelief, and so, so grateful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see the names of all these voice actors in the Mario Kart World credits, although their specific character roles are not listed. This follows on from the confirmation of DK and Pauline's voice actors in the latest Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, Microsoft Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Soulike games are truly everywhere nowadays. Back when FromSoftware's Souls series did not have the immense popularity it enjoys nowadays, the release of any game inspired by the series was an event in itself. However, today's increased offerings for hardcore action RPGs have led to some stagnation for the genre. While many Souslike games released in the past few years are solid games, very few of them are true standouts, as the vast majority of these games opt to stay within the boundaries of a tried and true formula that is starting to get a little tiring.</p>



<p>In this regard, Leenzee Games' Wuchang: Fallen Feathers definitely doesn't break the mold. While the game is a more than competent Soulslike featuring solid combat mechanics and a twist on the genre's typical character progression, it doesn't feature anything that makes it stand out from the competition, making some of its issues even more evident. This is not to say that it is a bad game by any means, just that someone who's experiencing Soulslike fatigue may not find the game particularly interesting.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250710000149_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers' setting is among the game's standout features</figcaption></figure>



<p>When it comes to the setting, at least, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sets itself apart from most games with its identity deeply steeped in Chinese history, lore, and mythology. Taking on the role of the amnesiac pirate warrior Wuchang, players will accompany her on a journey to reclaim her lost memories and find a cure for the Feathering disease that is ravaging the land. For some reason, Wuchang shows incredible resistance to the monstrous mutations this disease causes, allowing her to continue her investigation into the causes of the affliction and of a cure, without becoming a monster herself. </p>



<p>Supporting her is a varied cast of characters whose individual stories develop as the adventure proceeds, and simple side quests are completed, including recovering items or defeating certain enemies. The story and lore are further developed by documents scattered all over the game's world, item descriptions, and some environmental storytelling, which is generally well crafted, though it never reaches the heights of some other titles. Unfortunately, the story is never truly the focus of the experience. It tends to be a little predictable, never moving past the boundaries of the genre, but, at the very least, it gets its job done for those who wish to follow it, while hardly becoming an impediment for those who are only in for the action. However, those who are more invested in it will be more rewarded with the multiple endings the game features, which are rather different from one another.</p>



<p>Much like with the setting and narrative, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers doesn't innovate much within its genre, but it does what it does well enough. Controlling Wuchang with a third-person view, players explore a variety of intricately designed locations filled with powerful enemies and all sorts of traps, collecting gear and weapons on the way and using the obtained experience points, Red Mercury Essence, to level up at small shrine checkpoints.</p>



<p>In regards to character progression and gear, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers attempts to do things slightly differently, succeeding in providing a system that successfully deviates from the Soulslike norm. Instead of granting a single stat upgrade decided by the player, leveling up in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers grants the ability to unlock a single node in an extensive skill tree called Impetus Repository divided into different areas related to regular character progression. This includes improvements for the Manna Vase, the main healing tool which works similarly to the Souls series' flasks, and the Swift Draw ability, an extremely handy ability that allows Wuchang to switch between the two equipped weapons on the fly while unleashing a powerful special ability unique to the equipped weapon by consuming one charge of Skyborn Might (the main resource used to unleash Discipline Skills and powerful magic spell), and weapon type progression, which include stat increases, Mastery nodes requiring additional items to unlock, and extra abilities like new Discipline skills and passive skills that can profoundly change the playstyle of any weapon type. They can add passive abilities like clashing to specific attacks, allowing players to use them to parry attacks, stacks of other passive abilities that grant increased stats, the ability to gain Skyborn Might charges by performing certain attacks, and more. The ability to respec Wuchang at any shrine is also a great quality of life feature that makes it easier to experiment with different builds and playstyles.</p>

<p>Being able to experiment with builds without going through too many hurdles is only one of the reasons why WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers's combat system is one of the game's best features, if not the very best. Unlike your typical Soulslike, where the first few hours are made painfully difficult by the limited amount of combat options available, Wuchang is a competent warrior from the beginning of the adventure, thanks to the aforementioned Skyborn Might resource, which, at the start of the game, can only be obtained by perfectly dodging enemy attacks, but later on can be obtained by using certain attacks with all available weapon types - one handed swords, longsword, dual blades, axes and spears. While it is entirely possible to deal with most enemies using the varied light attack strings and the heavy attacks offered by each weapon type, it's by acquiring and using Skyborn Might that the combat system gets to a whole another level, as Weapon Skills, skills locked to a particular weapon, Discipline Skills, skills that can be assigned to any weapon of the same type, and magic spells can be seamlessly woven into any attack string. </p>



<p>As many of these skills can actually stagger, launch in the air, or knock an enemy down, these mechanics incentivize players to always be on the offensive and use these Skyborn Might-fueled abilities to prevent enemies from attacking Wuchang while keeping the offensive going. In some ways, these combat intricacies are more reminiscent of Team NINJA's masocore ARPGs like the Nioh series and Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, although with a slower pace that's closer in feel to the classic FromSoftware games. Unfortunately, this slower place sometimes feels more sluggish than slow, as there's some easily noticeable input delay, which is especially annoying when attempting to perform perfect dodges, as the timing doesn't feel very natural if you are more used to snappier games like the aforementioned Team NINJA games.</p>



<p>With Wuchang being rather competent right from the start of the adventure, enemy design had to take her abilities into account. However, there's still decent spread of enemies between weaker and stronger ones, though balancing is sometimes off, as weak enemies are generally some real pushovers, while some of the stronger enemies can feel a little bit overturned at times, as their movesets incorporate some natural dodges that can make it challenging to find a window of opportunity and take advantage of it. Enemy placement is generally decent, although the game still features enemies hidden behind corners and some difficult-to-reach ranged attackers, but they are generally manageable. What isn't, on the other hand, are select enemies found in some location that are either completely hidden until Wuchang gets near them, or that have a color palette which makes them blend with the environment, making it difficult to spot them and even understand what they are attempting to do while they are being attacked. This can sound a little like nitpicking, but the difference is stark with games that have a much better visual clarity, which makes it easier to keep track of what is going on. Bosses are generally well-designed, varied, and, most of all, challenging, thankfully not to the point of frustration like those in some recent Soulslikes. </p>



<p>Adding some more complexity to the WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers experience are a few other mechanics, including the Tempering mechanics, which allow players to add a variety of passive bonuses to weapons for further build refining, and the Inner Demon mechanics. The latter are particularly interesting, taking advantage of Wuchang's Feathering affliction to provide a risk and reward system. By fighting certain types of enemies, Wuchang's madness level increases and decreases, and after surpassing certain thresholds, certain skills learned via the Impetus Repository become active. If madness completely overtakes the young warrior, however, her attack power will increase at the cost of her defense, rewarding players who know how to properly defend against enemies. At the same time, getting defeated by an enemy at full madness will make Wuchang's Inner Demon manifest where she was previously defeated. While defeating the Inner Demon is the only way to recover the lost Red Mercury, leaving her be for a while is definitely a viable strategy, as she also attacks nearby enemies, providing players with new means to deal with a particularly strong foe. For example, you can let the Inner Demon and some enemies in the wear each other out, and then swoop in to finish them off and reap some rewards.</p>

<p>Besides combat, the other central element of any Soulslike is the level design, but in this regard, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers fares considerably worse. For starters, locations aren't exciting, except for a few that take good advantage of its setting, so you will be traversing the usual selection of ruined villages, spooky forests and dilapidated wastelands seen in a lot of other games, although there's a minor attempt at creating a bigger interconnected world in the vein of the original Dark Souls that is appreciated, and there are some definite standouts in terms of visual design, although not many. Their layouts, closer to Team NINJA's games rather than the Souls series, are not particularly remarkable either, as the game's locations are mostly linear, with a few branching paths that are not always rewarding to explore, not counting the handful of times when new gear is obtained. Unlike a few other games, finding new gear here is quite rewarding, as defensive affinities are critical to survive most bosses' attacks. Better yet, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers features a very simple transmogrification system, so any new gear a player finds unlocks visual customization options right away, of which I'm sure many will take advantage of during the around 40 hours needed to complete a single playthrough.</p>



<p>If one can look past the average level design of the game, which is ultimately not so terrible as to heavily impact the good WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers offers, looking past the game's middling performance on PC will be much harder for most. As the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-final-pc-requirements-dlss-fsr/">final system requirements suggested</a>, upscaling and frame generation may be a necessity for many system configurations to run the game at above 60 FPS, which is a little surprising considering the good-looking but not exceptional visuals. On my machine (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution with DLAA and high settings at an average of 37 FPS, 24 1% low, without frame generation in a benchmark session held in the Palace Hill area found around 10 hours into the game. Things fared better at 1440p resolution, hitting the 70, 75 FPS mark often, but it's only with Frame Generation that my system was able to hit to run the game at the maximum refresh rate of my monitor, 120 Hz, at this resolution. The tests above were conducted before NVIDIA launched a new driver optimized for the game, so performance could be better when the game officially launches to the public.</p>



<p>Frame Generation and NVIDIA DLSS set at Quality Mode using the slider found in the settings delivered better framerates in the same location, averaging 103 FPS, 32 1% low, but never hitting the 120 FPS cap. Even if it is possible to get a high refresh rate experience using upscalers and frame generation, WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers never feels very smooth, as the game suffers from some evident micro stuttering. Thankfully, there are no gigantic stutters, but the game often feels choppy, especially during fast camera movements. Those who cannot use NVIDIA DLSS have the choice of using either AMD FSR or UE5's TSR, and the presence of an oversampling resolution slider allows a greater degree of customization to help the user strike a better balance between image quality and performance.</p>

<p>Despite a bit of Soulslike fatigue, I enjoyed my time with WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, though I often found myself wondering what the game could have been with a few tweaks and improvements. That said, considering this is Leenzee Games' first attempt at a Soulslike, they’ve delivered commendably, especially in the combat department, which is powered by interconnected mechanics that work quite well. As such, I  hope the Chinese studio will get the chance to develop a sequel that smooths out the rough edges, because the potential for a standout Soulslike is clearly there.</p>

				<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a solid Soulslike offering an interesting setting steeped in Chinese history and lore, and well-crafted interwoven mechanics that power satisfying combat. However, uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware's catalog of exceptional action RPGs has garnered critical acclaim, and as a result, spawned the Soulslike subgenre, known for its exceptionally high difficulties, expansive worlds filled with diverse enemies, a methodical approach to combat, and a dark fantasy or mythological worldbuilding. Outside of the FromSoftware games, we've seen plenty of successful Soulslike games like <em>Darksiders 3</em>, <em>Remnant</em>, <em>Code Vein</em>, the <em>Star Wars Jedi</em> games, and recent releases like <em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>, <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>, and <em>Lies of P</em>. Now we have a new entry with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date" rel="nofollow">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a></em>.</p>

<p>Developer Leenzee looks to join its fellow contemporaries with their latest action RPG release, putting their unique, refreshing take on the Soulslike subgenre by delighting players with a vibrant world, engaging combat mechanics, challenging bosses, and a formidable protagonist in which their <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wuchang-fallen-feathers-preview" rel="nofollow">"portrayal of historical events aligns with mainstream historiography," according to game director Xia Siyuan</a>. With all of this in mind, have the developers produced a game that lives up to the expectations of another classic Soulslike game, and can <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> stand out from its counterparts?</p>

<h2>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Review - A New Soulslike Journey Begins</h2>

<p>Following its official reveal, <em>Wuchang</em> has drawn comparisons to a myriad of Soulsborne and Soulslike games, including <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, as well as Game Science's action RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. While many believe the comparisons are primarily positive, developer Leenzee seeks to give <em>Wuchang</em> its own identity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-51.jpg?itok=YcdFT4Kg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-51.jpg?itok=kMmfh2QW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bai Wuchang will explore the surrounding areas of the war-torn Shu to learn the mysterious origins of The Feathering disease. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://wuchanggame.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-xbox-games-showcase-reveal/" rel="nofollow">game's story follows its protagonist, Bai Wuchang</a>, who embarks on a life-threatening journey while exploring the areas of the ancient Shu kingdom during the late Ming Dynasty that have been ravaged by war and a contagion called The Feathering. Unfortunately, for our protagonist, she awakens to this world suffering from amnesia, and she is afflicted with The Feathering, which has gripped the Shu region and is mutating anyone who comes into contact with it.</p>

<p>Bai Wuchang thus explores this region in the pursuit of truth and learns how The Feathering came into existence through steel, blood, and magical powers as she plows her way through contorted enemies and ferocious bosses in the hope of finding a cure to purge this contagion. Luckily for her, she has the guidance of various NPCs along with an arsenal of weapons, a collection of spells, and skill trees to utilize on top of the game's unique combat systems to aid her in perhaps the deadliest mission she has embarked on by facing mutated enemies, ferocious area bosses, and her Inner Demon.</p>

<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> Review -&nbsp; Feather Of Truth Behind The Madness</h2>

<p>Exploration and traversal in <em>Wuchang</em> is what many will anticipate from an action RPG or Soulslike game, as the game follows a non-linear structure, boasting interconnected areas governed by a foreboding boss. The environments are beautiful and vibrant, which is a deviation from previous Soulslike games, which can be tonally dark and depressive, and the various characters that inhabit this world have varying personalities that either add to its vibrancy or depressive state and overall distinctive charm.</p>

<p>There are temples that can be found during her journey, but one in particular, the Shu Temple, acts as a central hub for much of the early game's campaign. Many of the game's important NPCs can be found here, providing relevant information or offering unique items and valuables for sale or to sell back to them for Red Mercury; the latter is used for upgrading character and weapon stats, unlocking nodes, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-31.jpg?itok=NEGITr-x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-31.jpg?itok=c7o2ID-c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Shu Temple will serve as a major hub space for Bai Wuchang that will be populated by a handful of characters who will assist her in her quest. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>Some temples may leave some valuable items and details about their history by interacting with unique interactive points that add more layers to the game's riveting story. While temples serve as an important hub in Bai Wuchang's journey, Shrines function as a save point, a teleport system to fast travel to other discovered Shrines she finds, and importantly, the Character Menu allows players to unlock and upgrade character and weapon stats and deposit items away.</p>

<p><a href="https://wuchanggame.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-2024-showcase-trailer-gameplay-bosses-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The game's combat system is one of the major gameplay aspects emphasized by the developers, as seen in multiple game trailers</a>, and has been designed to create magical and spectacular showcases and moments. Throughout her daring quest to learn the truth about The Feathering, Bai Wuchang has access to a range of weapons found throughout the world or acquired from enemies, bosses, and shop vendors, as well as spellcasting and skills.</p>

<p>These can be used in conjunction with the Skyborn Might and Temper systems, with Tempering allowing players to imbue their weapons with enhanced abilities through needles, while Skyborn Might is a valuable resource that enhances weapon abilities and spells but reduces their power. Additionally, Benedictions can also enhance various weapon abilities like blocking and counters, or character traits like stamina recovery or reduced damage taken when equipped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=tQ7yr7uI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=mJjDQeOZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Madness modifier gradually builds by defeating specific enemies or dying too frequently which at max, the inner demon will spawn at the site of where they last died. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>But whether it's accidentally dropping from great heights, not paying attention to their surroundings while engaging in combat with various enemies, or directly facing some of the most brutal boss battles, which are no pushover, death comes at a major price: Madness. Madness is a modifier that gradually builds when defeating specific enemies or dying too frequently and near or at its max, it increases Bai Wuchang's damage output but also increases the damage she takes.</p>

<p>This is indicated onscreen by the <em>"Madness Descends"</em> demonic mark and her eyes glowing red, but at the site of her last death, her Inner Demon will spawn, attacking everything within the vicinity. Defeating the Inner Demon is rewarding as it cleanses her Madness (which there is an item that can cleanse it), but it also awards her with the Red Mercury she lost before her death.</p>

<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> Review - Ruffling Up Some Feathers</h2>

<p>During my experience with <em>Wuchang</em>, I encountered a few issues alongside some bugs, glitches, and technical/performance errors that either caught me off-guard or left me in a state of confusion. Granted, when I wasn't fighting for my life by clearing enemy mobs or bosses or paying attention to the story, it was also spent dying quite a lot and in rather spectacular fashion (RIP to me platforming at Narrow Stretch chasing after a Bamboozling).</p>

<p>One issue that concerned me was the developers not having or utilizing a better option to explain the core gameplay features and combat mechanics, especially pertaining to Madness, Skyborn Might, and the Tempering systems. As a subtle request, players will spend a considerable amount of time reading about many of the game's features and mechanics once they're unlocked, and I feel there are better implementations to get players familiarized with these features and mechanics.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-39.jpg?itok=14LqTGmr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-screenshot-39.jpg?itok=JU84TMAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can unlock Weapon Skills and enhance their character stats and weapon abilities via the skill tree, which they must spend Red Mercury Essence. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>Much of this information is listed in the Help section, where players can read more or discover something new about these core gameplay features and mechanics below the System Help tab. This feels like a chore, having to switch between gameplay and the System Help tab all too frequently, which can potentially hurt the gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Performance-wise, there were few issues experienced other than the occasional input lag; however, given that this game is quoted as having "<em>high-fidelity visuals,"</em><strong><em> </em></strong>this could be an issue impacting gameplay (and not just visuals) for less powerful PCs. Character movement actions, such as sprinting and combat, will also be affected; however, for the best possible experience, toggle any or most graphics settings to the lowest possible setting, which may result in a less engaging gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Lastly, as much as I do love a good Soulslike game with a deeply immersive world and storytelling, <em>Wuchang&nbsp;</em>has an intriguing story on its hands, but how it's being told is less enticing than some of its contemporaries. The story heavily focuses on learning the truth behind The Feathering while uncovering the stories of Bai Wuchang's past, it felt there wasn't enough done to get me hooked on the story, nor continue developing the game's world into its story, and Bai's character writing is less desirable despite some NPCs being more fleshed out than her.</p>

<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Leenzee's action RPG <em>Wuchang</em> has the potential of being yet another great Soulslike game outside of FromSoftware's catalog, much like its predecessors in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>, and <em>Lies of P</em>. Its worldbuilding, quick and engaging combat, and intriguing narrative, explored through its protagonist, show that the developer has hit all the right notes, while adding some refreshing takes and plenty of vibrancy to the Soulslike subgenre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/screenshot-10527.jpg?itok=xLsDL-iS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/screenshot-10527.jpg?itok=ob1IvCnW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The area boss battles will be challenging and brutal but they can be defeated by learning their attack patterns and countering them. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Leenzee)</figcaption></figure><p>The enemies and bosses are challenging, and the encounters are pretty brutal, but the game's combat systems nail the key essentials expected from an action RPG (and a Soulslike game, generally speaking). Players will heavily rely on dodging attacks unless they wield weapons that allow them to block, and the Madness mechanic is an exhilarating addition, adding more nuance to the overall combat, making attacks more powerful, but similarly, leaving the protagonist more vulnerable to enemies' attacks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some inconveniences do make understanding various features and in-game mechanics quite tedious, resulting in spending too much time reading entries or questioning NPCs, and may frustrate players if they're not paying attention. The narrative is deeply fascinating, but the writing, character portrayals, and how it conveys this story are some of the weaker aspects of the game that didn't quite stick the landing in some instances, but certain characters and dialogue will be remembered and loved by players.</p>

That time can generously be described as eventful, but those events didn’t come out of nowhere. The saga of Waypoint to date is the perfect encapsulation of the state of games media in 2025.</p><p>The version of Waypoint that existed before Monday was <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought back to life</a> in 2024 after the original site’s high-profile closure in 2023 (<a href="https://remapradio.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribe to Remap!</a>). It was weird from the start; <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke once described it as an entire publication hanging askew</a>. Its tone was off-centre, it courted controversy a few times (<a href="https://archive.md/axZPq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most notably with a now-deleted story about right-wing VTubers</a>), and has now been seemingly done in by the ill-advised deletion of a couple more complicated stories and, following that move, resignations.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s start with the site’s original closure, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vice-shutting-down-waypoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resulting in layoffs affecting an entire crew of talented writers, who had garnered a loyal following</a> over years of hard work. Those writers built that following in spite of the stewardship of Vice Media, once at the forefront of a kind of edgy, youth-focused journalism that evolved over the years into a company that often did great work in the face of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/business/media/vice-sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workplace</a> scandals and <a href="https://defector.com/vices-avaricious-stewards-finally-succeeded-at-bleeding-it-dry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lavish executive pay</a>. Vice ultimately declared bankruptcy in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65462957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 2023</a>, shortly after closing Waypoint, and announced it would stop publishing and lay off most of its employees in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/02/22/vice-media-shuts-down-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2024</a>.

Former Waypoint managing editor Dwayne Jenkins told Aftermath he suggested the name be changed, but ownership obviously disagreed. Formerly a site of staffed writers covered by a union contract with the Writers Guild of America, East, the new Waypoint saw Jenkins as its only staffed employee, bolstered by a handful of contributors who were paid $30 a post.</p><p>High-output sites primarily staffed by <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-paid freelancers</a> is a popular model across games writing these days, as the industry shifts from staffed, often unionized employees to <a href="https://aftermath.site/valnet-report-freelance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">networks where writers are paid dollars per story instead of a salary</a>. Jenkins came from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwayne-jenkins-a467801b9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites</a> in the Gamurs network, as did the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/ana-valens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rest </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaun-cichacki-651417ab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/matt-vatankhah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waypoint’s</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentrkoepp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writers</a>, some of whom also had experience at a similar network <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-employees-detail-hostile-work-environment-cbr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valnet</a>, as well as other outlets. Those networks’ sites specialize in aggregation, reviews, and content geared toward Google results; they seldom, if ever, do reporting or analysis of the type the new Waypoint attempted.</p><p>Which isn’t to say Waypoint’s writers weren’t capable of or hadn’t done those forms of writing before, or that they didn’t do that kind of work at Waypoint. But they faced an uphill battle at the site. Former Waypoint workers told Aftermath that while all stories were approved by an editor, many of them were edited after publication, and potentially sensitive stories were not given the pre-publication legal review often common at other outlets. Jenkins told Aftermath that post-publication edits were “the norm” in his experience at Gamurs, where he said he learned “many, many bad habits” and “never had a REAL Capital-J journalist mentor.”</p><p>“I had, ‘Oh God I gotta make sure this content is churned out!’ Gamurs practices, and you know, of course, that Gamurs wasn’t exactly in the business of teaching anyone anything.”</p><p>"Waypoint is not equipped to handle reporting like it has been doing," VGBees’ John Warren <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/floppyadult.com/post/3luid7xv4us24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>. "I think the story of those pieces being taken down is important, but you have to acknowledge that…very little in the way of editing can lead to really massive mistakes in journalism."</p><p>This lack of experience, overseen by a venture capital firm led, predictably, to disaster: Vice is being rightly criticised for pulling the stories, and the mass resignations that followed have hollowed out the site and left writers with one less source of income in a brutal time for anyone trying to making a living as a games writer. The intentions of the site’s workers were surely in the right place, but the new Waypoint’s life was rife with pulled stories and others that just came off as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-want-waypoints-return-to-be-like-the-silent-hill-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tonally weird</a>, all of it while facing scrutiny and distrust from readers who saw the site’s new staff working under the “Waypoint” banner as a betrayal to what the site once was.&nbsp;</p><p>How much of this is on Waypoint’s staff or owners, and how much of it is just emblematic of the systemic rot in video games media and the wider media landscape in general? The mass <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs </a>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site closures</a> of the last five years have sucked whole generations of experienced, talented writers out of the games media industry. It has also meant the loss of experienced editors and leaders as well, the kind of people who understand the legal and journalistic rigor that has to go into serious reporting. But even beyond traditional journalism, experienced editors can help writers make sure any piece and its language clearly communicates what the writer means. This in turn helps create stronger writers, who can then mentor other writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The current media collapse is awful for so many reasons,” veteran games writer Carli Velocci <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlivelocci.com/post/3luidbpwgdd2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>. “But the lack of institutional knowledge and experience shaping reporting and mentoring the next generation might be one of the worst ones.”</p><p>Not only are there less and less jobs for these kinds of editors–as the sites that are still standing pivot to search-optimized, low stakes content–but as Jenkins’ description of his time at Gamurs shows, there are also less leaders to teach new writers and editors how to <em>become</em> those kinds of writers and editors. The consequences of this spirals, as journalistic best practices are lost in the games writing field, and even experienced writers, critics, and reporters find themselves without the support they need to do their work, outlets willing to take that work on, and the living wage that makes that work possible.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Under what other circumstances would Waypoint have lurched back to life other than capitalistic necromancy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p>As former games journalist Ian Boudreau <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianboudreau.com/post/3luifohbuqc2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Individual writers aren't the problem, they should be working with editors who are equipped to give them useful feedback and guidance on how to build a compelling and legally sound story. That layer of the business is effectively extinct.”</p><p>For Waypoint’s writers, being paid roughly $30 per post is a shocking, though <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not unheard-of</a> rate, little more than minimum wage when you work out the time required to formulate and write articles. Pair that with an inexperienced managing editor and Waypoint’s high volume output (relative to its headcount) and it’s little wonder the site struggled. It’s a pipe dream to think Waypoint or Vice broadly would ever be brought back with proper leadership, an investment in full-time writers, and a commitment to strenuous reporting and thoughtful criticism made possible by paying and protecting staff. Ownership dug up a URL that clearly still had some cache, and they got exactly what they paid for. Which all sucks, but how else could this have gone down? Under what other circumstances would Waypoint have lurched back to life other than capitalistic necromancy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t talk about the story of new Waypoint without noting that, despite what an obviously unpopular idea bringing the site back was, writers agreed to write there and be paid so little for their work. As former <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fanbyte-hit-by-round-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fanbyte</a> writer Colette Arrand <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colettearrand.bsky.social/post/3luijutb5ik2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “if you accept [$30] as your base rate of pay and it’s not a favor, you are actively making the material conditions for you and everyone in the field.” When <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valnet purchased Polygon</a>, gutted its staff, and then tried to hire again, many writers publicly shared their refusal to work at the corpse of a once-great site, despite being offered jobs (or, it seems in many cases, contract positions) in tenuous times. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zoehhannah.bsky.social/post/3lslpnl72ak2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Other</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/midimyers.com/post/3lriqqavk2s2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staffers</a> who kept their jobs eventually quit. Networks like Gamurs and Valnet run on writers desperate for games writing jobs, in a field that often chugs along on passion as an alternative to fair wages. A media owner with a games outlet on their hands might look around, see how the field works, and assume <em>that’s just how things work</em>, creating conditions that are, however wrongly and depressingly, industry standard. It’s hard to fault writers who need jobs for taking the jobs available to them in a landscape dominated by such jobs. Many workers have challenged journalism’s dismal status quo through <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/deadspin-entire-staff-quits-1203390454/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collective action</a> or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/08/04/about-one-in-six-u-s-journalists-at-news-outlets-are-part-of-a-union-many-more-would-join-one-if-they-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unionization</a>, but that sort of organizing is logistically and legally challenging–though not <a href="https://freelancesolidarity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impossible</a>–for freelancers. While there’s no denying that people accepting this kind of pay encourages companies to keep offering it, the true blame lies where these jobs and rates originate: at the top.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many instances in this whole saga where individuals could, and maybe even should, have made different decisions. But media owners and what they’ve turned the industry into hold the lion’s share of the responsibility for what is, ultimately, a <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemic</a> failure. They are the ones <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing sites’ focuses</a>, understaffing and underpaying them, and making the kinds of <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tone-deaf branding decisions</a> that set sites like Waypoint up to fail. Waypoint 2.0 might be ending (if this is indeed the end) exactly the way it started, as an example of everything wrong with how business and the wider internet view video games media in 2025: not as a source of news and entertainment, but as an undersupported mill that grinds out cents on the dollar, click by underpaid click.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast.</em></p><p><strong>Update11:40pm, July 23</strong>: <em>A link in the second paragraph has been updated to include an archived version of the deleted story.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires"><h3>Call Of The Night Is The Sensual Coming Of Age Anime I Craved As A Teen</h3></a><p>When you’re a teenager, falling in love is about as risky as becoming a vampire</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

<p>Update: Ubisoft CEO says it's coming to "other machines"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e18eb17f5942/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-23T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 23rd Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has apparently hinted at <strong>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong> for the Switch 2 in the company's latest quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">highlighted by IGN</a>, in a conversation with an investor regarding this title, Guillemot mentioned how there will be "some new versions" of this title "that will come on other machines".</p>
<p>Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet appeared to support this, noting how there will be another game "launched on the Switch 2" (seemingly within the current fiscal year) and this will be "beyond the announced releases" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>).</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 19th Apr, 2025 14:45 BST]</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft was already rumoured to be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">multiple titles to the Switch 2</a>, so what else might we see beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>?</p>
<p>According to a new listing on PEGI's website, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> is on the way to Nintendo's hybrid successor. You can see this on the home page of the site, but when you click through to the rating, there's no mention of a Nintendo version (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d2d49997b76d/assassins-creed-shadows.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life, PEGI</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new entry in Ubisoft's long-running series was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms in March 2025 and received a 'PEGI 18' rating for violence and in-game purchases. Here's the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111337">official description</a> of PEGI's rating:</p>
<h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advice for consumers</strong> This game has received a PEGI 18 which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for persons under 18 years of age. This rating has been given because it features graphic violence, violence against vulnerable and defenceless characters, and motiveless killing of innocent characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Brief outline of the game</strong> Action role-playing game, set in ancient feudal Japan, following two protagonists: Naoe, a young female shinobi, and an African samurai, Yasuke.</p>
<p><strong>Content specific issues</strong> This game contains depictions of graphic violence to human characters. It is possible to decapitate or dismember enemies, using bladed weapons. There are also examples of violence towards vulnerable and defenceless characters. Players may encounter hostage situations, where enemy groups line up bound civilians and execute them. Players are additionally able to kill multiple innocent civilians in towns and cities.</p>
<p><strong>Other issues</strong> This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of cosmetic bundles and a premium in-game currency called Helix Credits, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are depictions of the Japanese form of ritualised suicide, seppuku, in which characters take their own lives using a blade. This occurs in the historical context of a game set in feudal Japan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest development follows Ubisoft confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration">Star Wars Outlaws will be arriving for the Switch 2</a> on 4th September 2025. A new trailer has also been revealed for this game's second "story pack" DLC.</p>

We've got all the latest active codes for this Roblox experience, so you don't have to search for them yourself. Redeem each one for rewards like free items and gold to buy crates so you can build the best boat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Build A Boat For Treasure Codes (July 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are all the current active codes you can redeem in Build A Boat For Treasure, as well as the rewards you'll get from them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>chillthrill709 was here</strong> - Firework</li><li><strong>=D</strong> - 5 gold</li><li><strong>hi</strong> - 5 gold</li><li><strong>=p</strong> - 5 gold</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Build A Boat For Treasure Codes (July 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The below codes have unfortunately expired and will no longer work. We've included them here so you don't try to redeem them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Squid Army</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Build A Boat For Treasure Codes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/build-a-boat-for-treasure-redeem-codes-1752798881076.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Understanding how to redeem codes in Build A Boat For Treasure is important if you want to take advantage of those rewards. Follow these simple steps to learn how to get them:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Launch Build A Boat For Treasure on Roblox</li><li><strong>Press the Menu button</strong> on the right side of your screen that shows a green chest.</li><li>Then, press <strong>the button with two cogwheels</strong> at the top of this new window.</li><li>Scroll down until you see the big "Redeem Code" section. If you scroll too far, you'll end up in the credits section listing contributors.</li><li>Finally, type your code into the "Code" box and click the big green "Redeem" button.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Build A Boat For Treasure Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're having trouble redeeming a code, there are two common reasons why it may not be working:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The code is expired</li><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Boat For Treasure doesn't give you a lot of information when codes don't work. This can make it difficult to understand if it's one you've already redeemed or simply an expired code. However, if there's a typo or any other reason the code isn't functioning, the big green "Redeem" button will switch to a red one that says "Invalid".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to avoid codes showing up as invalid, we recommend <strong>copying and pasting the code directly from this article</strong>. As long as you don't accidentally get an extra space in there when copying it, it should work if it's active. We make sure to check and test every Build A Boat For Treasure code before we add them to this article.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Build A Boat For Treasure Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best ways to find more codes is by bookmarking our page here so you can check back for when new codes are added. However, if you want to try and find some codes yourself, you can take a look at the Build A Boat For Treasure <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ZTQEcX7UnU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Build A Boat For Treasure in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Boat For Treasure focuses on almost exactly what the name of the game tells you. Your goal is to build a boat block by clock so you can travel farther down a river. While that may sound simple, it’s actually tougher than you'd think. This is because there are all sorts of obstacles that can get in your way and destroy your ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll need to carefully sail around barriers or prepare to ram through them if you have enough ship to do so. Just be careful of flying baseballs and other projectiles that can bounce you into the air. As you get farther, you'll earn more gold that you can then buy more parts with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.

The big draw here is the sheer size of the game's roster, as it looks like just about every character from the show will be present and ready to throw down. Players assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing for special attacks to be chained together. When combined with the new "Rising" gameplay system, these heroes and villains can dish out a significant amount of damage during combat. The game also looks fantastic in action, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-hero-academias-next-game-already-looks-like-a-big-leap-forward-from-ones-justice/1100-6532925/" data-ref-id="1100-6532925">as the reveal trailer</a> showed off slick cel-shaded graphics.</p><p>So far, only a standard edition has been announced for All's Justice, and no preorder bonuses have been confirmed. However, we'll update this post if any additional versions or preorder incentives are announced. Physical PS5 and Xbox Series X copies are available to preorder at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're unfamiliar with My Hero Academia, the series began as a manga written by Kōhei Horikoshi and was then adapted into the now-popular anime series. My Hero Academia takes place in a world where certain people have superpowers, known as "Quirks." This has given rise to a new era of superheroes who protect the people from villains who use their quirks for crime, and the greatest of these public defenders is All Might. The series' protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, dreams of becoming a hero, but was born without a Quirk. However, a chance encounter with All Might allows him to inherit the ailing hero's powers, which makes him eligible to enroll at the prestigious UA Academy for upcoming superheroes.</p><p>My Hero Academia quickly became a smash hit in print and on TV thanks to its likeable everyman protagonist, colorful supporting cast, and a Japanese take on western comic books, and it will be interesting to see how the new My Hero Academia: All's Justice 3D fighting game will adapt the elements and expand upon the previously released 3D MHA fighting games released so far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535278"></a><figcaption>My Hero Academia manga</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg"></figure><p>While waiting for My Hero Academia: All Justice, you can catch up on the anime saga, as most of it is available on Blu-ray.
