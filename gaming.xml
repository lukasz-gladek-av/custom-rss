            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Genshin Impact’s latest character is Ineffa, an android who is getting slightly ahead of the 6.0 versions and showing us a glimpse of what we can expect from Nod-Krai mechanically. The final patch of each version is always a big old beach episode, so filler filled with little lore nods here and there, but Ineffa is certainly bringing the hype by literally changing one of the core reactions. To get the most out of her though, you’ll need the best Ineffa build you can put together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Character Trailer - &quot;Ineffa: Essentials for Home and Travel&quot; | Genshin Impact #GenshinImpact #Ineffa" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-n9weZtcN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Ineffa changes the electro-charged reaction into lunar-charged, which is unique (for now), in that it uses every character involved in the reaction to calculate damage, and it can also crit, which electro-charged couldn’t do. While this isn’t going to be especially well-utilised with just Ineffa, we have a feeling it’ll be more relevant when we get to Nod-Krai properly with the 6.0 patch.</p>


<p>Her elemental skill summons Birgittato to deal off-field electro damage, but also gives a skill based on Ineffa’s ATK. Her burst does a big old burst of damage, and also re-summons Birgitta. If you’ve been playing for any length of time, comparing Ineffa to Fischl is the simplest way to understand things. However, most of Ineffa’s power is in one of her passives, which allows Birgitta to do additional lunar-charged damage if the effect is already in play when Birgitta attacks. With all of this in mind, Ineffa is a sub-DPS with some shielding capabilities, and she could be a nice little boost to hydro and electro teams.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Ineffa Best Weapon</h3>
<p>Ineffa’s signature weapon is Fractured Halo, a polearm that boosts ATK after using the elemental skill or elemental burst, and boosts lunar-charged damage if the equipping character creates a shield during that effect. However, if you’re not using this, any of the five-star weapons can do an alright job of things, but you might be better off going with a four-star weapon if you’re not using her signature.</p>

<p>Kitain Cross Spear is an excellent option because it not only gives elemental mastery and boosts elemental skill damage, but it also gives Ineffa some more energy. Ineffa does need to be able to use her burst, so this weapon ticks all of the boxes you need it to, at least for a four-star option. You can also go for the Ballad of the Fjords, or the trusty Favonius Spear, because it’s good on everyone.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Ineffa Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>As of Ineffa’s release, there really isn’t a great artifact set for her. We’re expecting one to come along in the 6.0 patch, but for now, you’ve got a few options that’ll do the job. The frontrunner for us is to use a set that just fits well enough for now, which is going to often just be two two-piece sets of ATK boost, like Gladiator’s Finale.</p>
<p>You can also run her with Tenacity of the Millileth if you want more shield strength and more buffs, or with Gilded Dreams for boosting her damage. For stats, you basically want an ATK sands, an ATK goblet, and a Crit circlet, most likely Crit DMG as Ineffa ascends with Crit Rate. You can go for EM if you’re interested in messing around with a hyperbloom team too.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA and Respawn </a>have just debuted a new gameplay trailer for the latest season for Apex Legends, which is up to its 26th season now since the free-to-play movement-focused battle royale launched in 2019. Season 26: Showdown will arrive on all platforms on August 5, 2025, bringing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-game-updates">some significant changes</a> to the gameplay, including a new permanent mode, Wildcard.</p>



<p>Wildcard is a new mode that really lets players break the tried-and-true systems of Apex Legends. Gone are any cares towards tactical synergies between Legends. You can stack your whole team with the same legend if you want in Wildcard, as you zip and fly around the altered version of Kings Canyon which has been tuned with more ziplines, more launch pads, and every player gets a second chance without having to be revived, so long as you die before the final ring. </p>



<p>Looting has also been simplified and streamlined in this mode to make everything as action-packed as possible. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other changes beyond the addition of Wildcard as a new permanent mode include the introduction of Elite weapons, the first of which is the RE-45. Two Legends, Caustic and Bangalore, are getting significant buffs this season. Amps are being introduced as new passive upgrades players can pick up in ranked and unranked matches. Hop-ups will be locked to weapons now instead of being pick-ups on the ground for players to loot. The reign of the Jumpmaster has ended, as ranked matches will now feature pre-assigned drop zones instead, and the E-District map is getting a switch to a daytime setting.</p>



<p>These are also just the highlights regarding the big changes, as the full details will be unveiled with the full patch notes that will arrive a day before Season 26 goes live, on August 4, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much like the titular monsters who inhabit its dreaded world of darkness, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>’s development has been a bit of a cursed creature. Once under the development of the team at Harsuit Labs, it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">shifted to the horror pros at The Chinese Room</a></span>, who recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437">an excellent follow-up DLC</a></span> to one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587">my favorite horror games from last year</a></span>. The Chinese Room definitely knows how to strike a tone with horror, and based on a recent dive into the game’s development with <em>Game Informer</em>, the team sounds locked in to deliver a <em>VtM</em> experience that isn’t looking to just be <em>GTA</em> with sharp, pointy teeth. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,195922,196539" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437">This DLC Follow-Up To One Of Last Year’s Hidden Horror Gems Made Me Cry Out In Terror</a></span></p><p>“We’re not making <em>GTA</em>; this isn’t a big open world, sprawling game where the horizon is your limit,” the game’s art director, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/07/29/detail-over-scope-were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/07/29/detail-over-scope-were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Matthews, told <em>Game Informer</em></a></span>. Instead, the developers are aiming for density packed into a smaller region with clear boundaries, all designed to keep you focused on the central and delicate bloody balance between the “jovial, human world” and the “dark, vampire world.” </p><p>The original <em>Bloodlines</em> was a notoriously messy game. It gained cult status many moons ago as modders took to repairing its loose ends and, given that it offered such a unique experience, many fans were willing to overlook its shortcomings. Where else would you get to roleplay as a fledgling kindred trying to make it on the mean streets of Los Angeles? </p><p>There’ll be a little less freedom in who your character is in the upcoming sequel. Instead of rolling your own character, you’ll be given a choice of clans and genders for a pre-written character, Elder Phyre, a 400-year-old vamp newly awoken in Seattle. </p><p>That may be a bummer for those of us who wanted to play as a vampire of our own creation, but as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-channeling-the-best-part-of-deus-ex-mankind-divided-a-dense-hub-instead-of-a-huge-open-world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-channeling-the-best-part-of-deus-ex-mankind-divided-a-dense-hub-instead-of-a-huge-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our comrades over at <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> have highlighted, forgoing a massive open world in exchange for a focused, hub-like space to prowl speaks to a more intimate experience of the kind we’d expect in something like <em>Deus Ex</em>. And if there’s anything that benefits from a more intimate experience, it’s certainly <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>.</p><p>Having an intimate space to play in sounds like an advantageous way to leverage the very core of what makes <em>Vampire</em> <em>Vampire</em>: Needing to preserve the masquerade. The source material isn’t just about playing as bloody monsters; it’s about staying hidden, to preserve power, to protect the vulnerable. It’s a double-edged metaphor that can make for exciting choices and high-stakes situations. And were <em>Bloodlines 2</em> to be set in a massive world, it could be all too easy to get out of Dodge to avoid the deadly consequences of breaking the masquerade by feeding on humans in public or showing off your monstrous powers. </p><p>Vampires are also very restricted creatures. Sure, they live forever, but they must earn it: They have to feed, they must avoid sunlight, and it’s wise for them to ask permission before entering someone’s home. Limiting the scope of the playable space sounds like a perfect way to create the kind of contained, forced situations that lead vampires to become such dangerous cornered animals in the lore, and often at the table with dice.</p><p>The curse of Cain has clearly run through <em>Vampire</em>’s existence in video game form, all the way up to its present tumultuous development. But maybe this undead beast will grab us by the throat when it (hopefully) arrives later this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Monomi Park has announced that the v1.0 full release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a> is coming on 23rd September 2025, the game launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on that date.</p>
<p>The full game will bring a big update that adds things like a new twist on Drones – something to do with Quantum – more gadgets and upgrades, new places to explore and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slime Rancher 2 - Release Date and Physical Pre-Order Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHjvTdgS_p0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beyond this, Monomi Park is partnering with iam8bit for a physical release, which will come out on 14th January 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Pre-ordering will net you a Slime Rancher 2 soundtrack download, a fold-out poster designed by renowned art director, Yusuke Naora, and pre-orders of the iam8bit Exclusive Edition, you can also get a sticker sheet of the wiggliest slimes and an O-Sleeve featuring Beatrix LeBeau and the rest of the Slime Rancher 2 crew. That Exclusive Edition will only be available for pre-order through 26th August.</p>
<p>The full release of Slime Rancher 2 has been a long time coming. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/13/slime-rancher-2-announced-and-it-is-an-xbox-console-launch-exclusive/">Originally announced in the summer of 2021</a>, the game entered into PC and Xbox early access in 2022, with a slow drip feed of updates and content in the years since then. Heck, it’s even been a full year since the early access game came to PS5 in June 2024!</p>

<p>It’s also been a long time since I checked in with the game. We have to go back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/27/slime-rancher-2-early-access-review-xbox-game-pass/">my initial impressions</a>, where I said, “There’s a reason why the original Slime Rancher was so popular, and it’s clear even from the opening couple hours that Slime Rancher 2 is building on the exact same relaxed farming gameplay. The Early Access release shows a gentle evolution of the formula, giving a few morsels of what’s to come as the game grows, and we hope there’s bigger surprises down the road.”</p>

<p>Translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-veteran-says-nintendo-was-the-only-one-making-steady-revenue-from-nes-game-carts-capcoms-profits-really-took-off-with-the-ps1/">Automaton Media</a>, Okamoto detailed that it was harder for third-party developers such as Capcom and retailers to actually turn a profit making and selling games for the Famicom. And, from his experience, "only Nintendo had a guaranteed profit."</p>
<p>"Let’s say a Famicom cartridge sold for 10,000 yen at retail. Out of that, 3,000 yen went to the retailer. 4,000 yen went to the software developer, like Capcom, and 3,000 yen went to Nintendo," which sounds okay at first glance, but Okamoto clarifies that "Out of Nintendo’s 3,000 yen share, about 1,500 went to manufacturing contractors."</p>
<p>"Since Nintendo got paid upfront for the exact number of copies, manufactured the cartridges, and delivered them, what happened after that didn’t matter to them." Back in the '80s, Capcom was a relatively new developer, and had to pay around 3,000 yen per unit upfront.</p>
<figure><a title="NES cartridge profits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2fe46539a22f7/nes-cartridge-profits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">Yoshiki Okamoto</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resulted in the company taking out bank loans to ensure it could afford to pay the Big N, but this built up over time, as it apparently took Nintendo up to 3 months to supply cartridges. Then, Capcom had to send those cartridges and invoices to distributors, but it would rarely get paid immediately, instead receiving a promissory notice to say the money would be coming in 3 months.</p>
<p>That meant, often, that any profit would take up to 6 months to reach Capcom, which would likely be spent on clearing those bank loans. Okamoto also talks about unsold cartridge stock, where developers would often have leftovers thanks to having to over-order, as production took around 3 months. That adds another 3,000 yen unit to costs.</p>
<p>Okamoto still stresses that the NES and SNES were worth it for Capcom, despite cartridges "really only" benefitting Nintendo — and you only have to look at Street Fighter II sales figures to see that.</p>
<p>So, while cartridge-based systems, costs were higher — and that's still true today, from what we know — so when the PlayStation was announced, and disc manufacturing costs were cheaper, it was a dream for third-parties.</p>

<p>“Capcom’s profits skyrocketed with the switch from cartridges to discs,” Okamoto tells viewers, stating that not only were manufacturing costs cheaper, but that Sony would also return its share of the pay (1,600 yen of the 1,800 paid, for example) if Capcom returned any unsold CDs.</p>
<p>Faster restocking speeds, allowing devs to respond much quicker to sale spikes and interests, meant that Capcom was able to thrive even more in the disc-based era. But Nintendo was still a huge part of its success because it allowed them to grow their player base <em>and</em> get a foot in the door in the console gaming space.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating look at how video game development worked back in the late '80s and early '90s, and yet another look at why the PS1 did as well as it did. Who knows how different things would be with that Sony disc add-on for the SNES...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio and NetEase have recently held the <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final pre-launch test</a> for Where Winds Meet across both PC and PlayStation 5, and we've taken the opportunity to interview the development team once again (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly three years after the first time</a>) ahead of the release.</p>



<p>As a reminder, Where Winds Meet is an open world action adventure RPG in the Wuxia fiction, set in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, which ran from around 907 to 979. In the game, players forge their own path as a Wuxia martial arts hero, a sword master raised amidst war and conflict while concealing a hidden identity. As they navigate a world on the brink of division and unrest, they will be confronted with difficult choices shaping their character's destiny. </p>



<p>The single player is said to last over 150 hours, but there's also plenty of online multiplayer options, as you'll read in the answers to our wide-ranging questions, which were provided by Lead Designer Chris Lyu.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>You set up various limited-time tests to gather feedback. Based on user feedback, what were the main changes you applied to the game?</strong></p>



<p>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles. We’ve held several test phases, and the feedback we’ve received has been incredibly valuable. Players’ insights have helped us make a number of targeted adjustments throughout development.</p>



<p>For localization, we’ve focused on keeping the philosophical depth and poetic spirit of Wuxia, while rewriting dialogue using language and expressions that are comfortable and relatable for global players. We’re also adding full English voice-overs, so the story can be experienced naturally, in players’ own languages. On the user experience front, we’ve simplified the early tutorial system to address concerns about too many mechanics at once, and we’ve redesigned the UI to make cultural symbols—like ink wash motifs and traditional patterns—clear and easy to recognize.</p>



<p>In terms of content, we’re adding explanations for mythological references (like clarifying the difference between the Chinese "Long" and the Western "dragon"), and we’re enhancing visual storytelling to make the cultural elements intuitive. We’ve kept core features like traditional Chinese clothing and landscape-inspired art, so even players unfamiliar with these elements can get an immediate sense of the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>



<p>For iconic systems such as Acupoint Hitting and Acupuncture, we’ve preserved their original forms, but added clearer feedback so the gameplay feels satisfying and intuitive. We’re also reworking social features to highlight universal themes—honor, brotherhood, and growth through adversity—that everyone can relate to. Of course, all of this is still a work in progress. We’re constantly optimizing and refining the game, and we truly hope that, once it’s released, players around the world will enjoy and immerse themselves in this Eastern martial arts world we’re building.</p>



<p><strong>When we last spoke, you said you were still adjusting the world&nbsp;size. Can you share more details about that now?</strong></p>



<p>The world of "Where Winds Meet" is constantly growing, both in scale and in richness. Right now, we’re working hard to prepare new regions and areas, continually adding diverse landscapes and unique architecture to bring the world to life. For this round of testing, we’re excited to open up the brand-new Kaifeng region. Compared to Qinghe—the area we featured in earlier tests—Kaifeng is 1.5 times larger. At its heart is a sprawling city covering over one million square meters, a grand metropolis designed to capture the imagination.</p>



<p>It’s a completely new, distinctive area, and we truly hope players will be as inspired by its scale and majesty as we are. When we designed Qinghe, our vision was to create a sense of “home.” Unlike bustling cities, Qinghe is peaceful and pure—endless fields, simple villages, and vibrant natural ecosystems. The region features sweeping wildlands, secluded settlements, winding rivers, and hidden caves. But it’s also shaped by history: set in the late Tang dynasty, when warlords divided the land and conflict was frequent. You’ll see war-torn ruins, deserted temples, secret underground passages, and yet also encounter villages rich with human warmth and stories. Local martial arts factions hide among the mountains, weaving together a landscape that is both complex and deeply narrative-driven.</p>



<p>Each of these areas feels like a slice of history, filled with dramatic and touching stories waiting to be discovered. Players can follow the main storyline to gradually unravel these mysteries, or explore freely and uncover hidden legends on their own, weaving their own adventures through the city’s alleyways and markets. Looking ahead, we have even more unique and fascinating regions planned for future updates. The world of "Where Winds Meet" will only keep expanding, and we can’t wait for players to experience all the stories and wonders we’re preparing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kaifeng-City-1-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kaifeng, on the other hand, is one of China’s eight ancient capitals and was once among the largest cities in the world. In our game, we’ve recreated Kaifeng on a massive scale, striving to capture the unique spirit of the era. The city itself is like a vibrant painting, divided into several highly distinctive districts.</em> <em>Compared to Qinghe—the area we featured in earlier tests—Kaifeng is 1.5 times larger. At its heart is a sprawling city covering over one million square meters, a grand metropolis designed to capture the imagination.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On the Steam page, you mentioned that Where Winds Meet features a 'rich, narrative-driven campaign'. Is there a full-fledged storyline? Can players make choices at&nbsp;specific&nbsp;points?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Our goal is to offer players a truly open-world experience with a high degree of freedom, while still telling a deep and complete main story. To achieve this, we’ve chosen to let player choices have the greatest impact in side quests, adventure stories, and world exploration, rather than on the main storyline. For example, when players explore the world and encounter various side missions or activities, they can approach challenges in different ways. You might choose to defeat your enemies with martial arts and accomplish your goal through combat. Alternatively, you could become a master persuader, using your words to convince opponents and avoid fighting altogether. Or, you might use your medical skills to heal those you meet—including your enemies—turning potential foes into friends. We want every player to feel that their decisions matter and that there are always multiple paths to any outcome.</p>



<p><strong>In our previous chat, you said the story wouldn't account for much of the whole game. Has that changed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That’s something we’ve thought about a lot. We want to weave the story seamlessly into the world itself, without ever breaking the core open-world experience. For us, the real magic of an open world comes from immersive exploration and meaningful interaction with the environment. So, instead of forcing the story upon players, we’ve carefully hidden narrative fragments throughout the world. Players are encouraged to discover and piece together these story elements on their own, through exploration and curiosity. As you uncover and connect these fragments, a sweeping epic gradually unfolds before you—one that feels truly personal and rewarding because you brought it together yourself.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lively-City-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Where Winds Meet" is designed to give players the best of both worlds. In Single Player mode, you can fully immerse yourself in a rich, personal martial arts journey, experiencing the story at your own pace. At the same time, you can invite up to four other players into your game to explore the world together when you wish. If you’re looking for even more dynamic interactions, you can seamlessly enter the lively "Jianghu" multiplayer world. Here, you can team up with friends for challenging combat, cooperative missions, and shared adventures. These two modes are designed to complement each other, giving you the freedom to play however you like—whether you prefer exploring alone or joining forces with others, the choice is always yours.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Regarding multiplayer, the Steam page says that users can 'open up their world to a group of up to four players'. Does that mean the campaign and story can be fully completed with a group of players?</strong></p>



<p>"Where Winds Meet" is designed to give players the best of both worlds. In Single Player mode, you can fully immerse yourself in a rich, personal martial arts journey, experiencing the story at your own pace. Certain key storylines and moments are meant to be completed solo, allowing for a truly individual adventure. At the same time, you can invite up to four other players into your game to explore the world together when you wish.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for even more dynamic interactions, you can seamlessly enter the lively "Jianghu" multiplayer world. Here, you can team up with friends for challenging combat, cooperative missions, and shared adventures. These two modes are designed to complement each other, giving you the freedom to play however you like—whether you prefer exploring alone or joining forces with others, the choice is always yours.</p>



<p><strong>Indeed, these other features of Where Winds Meet sound a lot like an MMO: creating a guild, fighting in guild wars, multiplayer dungeons, epic raids, and more. There's also mention of 'thousands of fellow adventurers'. Can you explain how this is going to work? Are there different servers to choose from when transitioning to multiplayer?</strong></p>



<p>Our Multiplayer mode is designed specifically to recreate the authentic, living world of the "Jianghu"—the legendary community of martial artists and wanderers. We want players to truly feel what it’s like to live and interact in this ancient world, meeting and dealing with other real players who are all playing their own unique roles. The core of our Multiplayer design rests on two main pillars:</p>



<ol>
<li>The social enjoyment of real player interactions;</li>



<li>A strong sense of martial arts immersion and role-playing. With these in mind, we’ve created features where players can form and role-play as in-game organizations—like escort agencies or taverns—and work together to build their reputation through cooperative construction and activities. You might play as a traveling doctor and join with other healers to treat sick players, or take on the role of a shadowy vigilante, standing up for others and upholding justice in the world.</li>
</ol>



<p>We also offer flexible ways to access Multiplayer content. For example, if you encounter a particularly challenging boss, you can summon other players to assist you using the in-game support system. There are dedicated options for switching into Multiplayer mode whenever you want to enjoy these unique experiences. At this stage, players don’t need to choose servers—everything is seamlessly integrated to keep the community together. Ultimately, our goal is to create a dynamic, social, and immersive Jianghu where every player can find their own place and story.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Exploration.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Our goal is to build "Where Winds Meet" into a living, ever-evolving world. We’re committed to supporting the game for the long term with major updates that expand the lore, deepen gameplay, and respond to player feedback. Future content will continue to enrich both the single-player story experience and the multiplayer social and cooperative aspects, ensuring there’s always something new for different types of players.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As I understand it, Where Winds Meet will be free to play. Can you discuss the monetization system? Can you reassure fans that it won't be a pay-to-win game? Will there be a Battle Pass?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, "Where Winds Meet" is a free-to-play game. We offer options like a battle pass, a monthly subscription, and paid cosmetic items. And yes, there will be absolutely no pay-to-win content. So everyone can enjoy a fair and balanced experience.</p>



<p><strong>What are your post-launch plans? What kind of content can players expect after release, and how often?</strong></p>



<p>Our goal is to build "Where Winds Meet" into a living, ever-evolving world. We’re committed to supporting the game for the long term with major updates that expand the lore, deepen gameplay, and respond to player feedback.

<figure><a title="Elden Ring" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e80359f0f02d0/elden-ring.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-tomorrow-31st-july-2025">a new Nintendo Direct coming very soon</a>, and it's a Partner Showcase, which means it's time for third parties to shine.</p>
<p>Since launch, we've seen some big hitters from publishers like Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>), CD Projekt (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>), and SEGA (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>), but despite a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">very solid lineup</a> at launch, you get the feeling that Nintendo has kept the floodgates closed to give early releases time to breathe.</p>
<p>However, with 25 minutes to fill, it looks like that's about to change. We're expecting big news, including release dates for previously announced games (hi there, FromSoft), but also a handful of surprises - or not-quite-surprises-but-exciting-all-the-sames. (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nis-accidentally-reveals-upcoming-switch-2-game-sparking-even-more-direct-speculation">And that one NIS itself apparently leaked.</a>)</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll at the bottom what you expect to see pop up (and leave a comment with other suggestions/wild dreams). First, though, let's take a look at Team NL's third-party predictions for upcoming Direct...</p>

<p>Me being who I am, my thoughts immediately darted to the handful of RPGs that haven’t got release dates yet – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> – but I think this is the place to announce something new. Not just a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> port (which is <em>probably</em> coming; it’s on everything else).</p>
<p>Nope, I’m sticking my neck out, because it’s time to announce that darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake. Stop teasing me with new art and new merchandise; give me a reimagining of my favourite Final Fantasy game right now.</p>
<p>I think we’ll <em>probably</em> get a bit of indie coverage too; I’d love to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, perhaps a cheeky little <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/steam/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> surprise. And hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a>’s final release date? It just had what is supposed to be its final patch. A date can’t be far off now.</p>
<p>Once again, I <em>refuse</em> to say the game with the initials <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">HK:S</a>. I want it, badly, though. But I can’t be disappointed this way.</p>
<h2>Ports and Puzzlers (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1f79560e1f33/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, let me brush off my book of 'Switch Ports Plz' that I've been building for the past five years and see what jumps out, starting with some recent biggies that I think <em>could</em> be likely.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> have the 'huge-following-meets-unexpected-smash-hit-release' factor in them that makes me think a speedy Switch 2 version could be on the cards. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_3_reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> into there too — nothing unexpected about that one, but there's no way that it doesn't come our way eventually.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I'm still holding out hope for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvels_midnight_suns">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>. Remember when that was definitely 100% coming to Switch before it just... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/marvels-midnight-suns-on-switch-no-longer-planned">quietly didn't</a>? Marvel could do with a little goodwill at the moment, and this would be one hell of a way to do it. Slot it in before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Cosmic Invasion</a> and <em>boom</em>, you've got a Fall/Winter double bill.</p>
<p>The puzzler in me is still begging for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/witness">The Witness</a> — which seems less likely every year — but a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> port feels like a no-brainer after the stellar launch a few months back, and I'd happily turn a blind eye to that 60+ hour PS5 playtime to start again on Switch 2.</p>
<p>And you know I can't touch on puzzlers without mentioning my beloved Hershel. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> is due out <em>this year</em> and we still don't have as much as a release window. C'mon, Level-5, don't break me.</p>
<h2>Vanquish Donkey Kong and bring me Snake Eater (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hades 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a9aa250c84b9/hades-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very excited about this Direct. I wanna see a strong lineup of games stretching into Xmas now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is old news. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>? Ancient history. Give me a few big third-party heavy hitters, (most of which the team has already mentioned here, but I'll double down on wanting to see more Hades 2 details, alongside Clair Obscur, Elden Ring, and Blue Prince).</p>
<p>I'd love to see some oldies revamped. Give me <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/vanquish">Vanquish</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, y'know, the S-Tier stuff. More likely, I reckon we could see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> show up, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resi remake</a> games — some of which have appeared in cloud form — could perhaps see actual ports. Besides these, give me a Metaphor ReFantazio port with bonus Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p>I reckon we'll get everything I just typed out. So I might as well throw a port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metal_gear_solid_delta_snake_eater">Metal Gear Delta: Snake Eater</a> in for good measure.</p>
<h2>Microsoft announcing something other than layoffs and AI guff (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Sea of Thieves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/19991f33a5ba5/sea-of-thieves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xbox Game Studios has been quiet about Switch 2 despite plans to expand its software catalogue to anything that'll play it. I've wanted <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/rare_replay">Rare Replay</a> on a Nintendo system for years, and it feels like a better fit now than ever. More likely we'll see the rumoured <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/sea_of_thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> port, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6">Call of Duty</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">promised Switch debut</a>, and something else - a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_5">Forza Horizon</a> potentially, or perhaps <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indy</a> shows up on Switch following his PS5 appearance. Some good news out of Microsoft, for once.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the team has covered the bases, loads of good stuff up there. But Alana mentioned my personal 'most wanted' - I've been jonesing for UFO 50 on Switch since it launched on PC, and I'd imagine Switch 2's extra grunt would help in the port department.</p>
<p>Aside from all the expected ports, a handful of exclusives would be lovely, too - or at least some new all-platform announcements. Nothing against Switch 2 ports (the more, the merrier), but after years of 'Yay, a fuzzier, portable version of a game everyone else played years ago,' some freshness wouldn't go amiss while Switch 2's still got that new system smell.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Wow, not a single <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mention. Have we moved on? (Nah, we absolutely still want that, too.)</em><em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>While you can now start collecting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/712965/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s Johto-themed Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion</a>, two of the set’s rarest cards are being changed in response to concerns about art theft.</p></div><p>Soon after dataminers began posting images of Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s cards on Tuesday, Chinese artist lanjiujiu took to their X account with questions about <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>using illustrations that seemed to have been traced from their own work. In particular, lanjiujiu pointed to Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive Ho-Oh card drawn by <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/SIE_NANAHARA">Sie Nanahara</a>, a Japanese illustrator who has previously produced a number of art pieces for The Pokémon Company.</p><p><em>Pokémon TCG</em> <em>Pocket</em>’s original immersive Ho-Oh card bore a number of visual similarities to a piece of art lanjiujiu was commissioned to illustrate in 2021. lanjiujiu did not specify who originally commissioned them, but their art clearly served as the reference for <a href="https://www.kaioland.com/en/product/pokemon-pc-house-ho-oh-resin-statue/">a resin statue sold by PC House Studio</a>, a company that makes unlicensed collectibles.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/617134/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism"><em>Polygon</em> notes</a>, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/information">has made clear</a> that, when fans distribute art featuring any of the company’s copyrighted intellectual property, they are agreeing to “a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license” that gives it the right to “use, transmit, copy, modify, and display Fan Art (and its derivatives) for any purpose.” Legally speaking, that means TPC would have been in the clear to keep the immersive Ho-Oh as is. But last night, the company announced that it now plans to update the card as well as Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive Lugia, which also featured the Ho-Oh art as part of a short animation.</p><p>“We are also conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game,” TPC said in <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652/photo/1">a statement posted to X</a>. “To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control processes to prevent this from happening again.”</p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>situation is the latest instance of a popular mobile card game getting in hot water for using fan art without contacting the original artist. Earlier this year, <em>Marvel Snap</em> faced similar accusations on two separate occasions — once regarding a <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/gaming-marvel-snap-fan-artist-accuses-game-of-plagiarism-mbaku-pixel-art">pixel variant M’Baku card</a> that resembled an illustration by fan artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thatjaykart/?hl=en">Jason Kiantoro</a>, and another involving <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-accused-of-stealing-art-from-kamen-rider-wizard/">a card of the Ancient One</a> that borrowed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1m2yom7/update_on_marvel_snap_stealing_assets_from_kamen/">visual elements from <em>Kamen Rider Wizard</em></a>.</p><p>In the latter instance, <em>Marvel Snap </em>simply changed a few details rather than releasing an entirely new card. It’s not clear when <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>will update Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive cards, but if you happen to pull them now, you’ll be greeted with a box that says “new art coming soon.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/715823/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia-tracing-lanjiujiu]]></content:encoded>

New console-defining IPs have yet to arrive (maybe <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>?) and the live-service money pit Sony went all in on has accomplished little while tying up some teams for years. </p><p>Anchored by both<em> Death Stranding 2</em> and<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>, it would be farfetched to call 2025 a bad year for PlayStation games, but it’s certainly still feeling like a lighter one overall for the platform. Despite big third-party releases like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> early in the year, the second half feels lighter than it should for where we’re at in the PS5's lifecycle. Momentum should be building back up to another end-of-the-generation crescendo as developers squeeze every last optimization out of the hardware. It still feels like we’re waiting for the cavalry to arrive. </p><p>Enter Xbox. A steady <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">stream of multiplatform releases</a></span> and ports of prior exclusives is currently doing some very heavy lifting on PS5. Over half of the top 10 bestselling games on the console in the last quarter were from Microsoft, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a new chart</a></span> shared this week by Circana director of game research Mat Piscatella.<em> Forza Horizon </em>5 and <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> were numbers two and three, while <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> held down the sixth and eight spots, respectively. (Perennial chart-toppers <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Minecraft</em> also put in work.)<br></p><p> Xbox games will continue bolstering the PS5's lineup throughout the year. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>brings the franchise to PlayStation for the first time next month alongside <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, with<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em> providing a big sci-fi RPG shooter for the fall. There’s also the Microsoft-published<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and any other fall releases the company hasn’t gotten around to announcing yet. How long before the rumored <em>Starfield </em>port arrives as well? And is there a version of <em>Halo</em> that comes to PS5 sooner than an upcoming remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>?<br></p><p>No modern console is singularly defined by its first-party exclusives anymore (unless you’re Nintendo), but at a time when PlayStation Studios has temporarily stalled, long-time rival Xbox has turned out to be an unexpectedly fortuitous pillar helping to hold up the PS5 as it nears its twilight years. It’s all thanks to a multiplatform strategy that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. If Microsoft had kept all of its recently acquired toys exclusive, as seemed increasingly likely as recently as 2023, this year might have felt like an especially dire one for PS5 players. Instead, Microsoft’s expensive new mega-publishing apparatus has helped the console recover from a series of self-inflicted fumbles. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/not-just-seeing-red-virtual-boy-emulator-adds-full-color-support/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/not-just-seeing-red-virtual-boy-emulator-adds-full-color-support.1257291/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>With Red Viper's built-in color support, though, anyone with a 3DS <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/">modded for homebrew software</a> can now easily add a bit of color to the Virtual Boy library. And running the emulator on the 3DS means you don't even have to give up the Virtual Boy's stereoscopic graphics to do so; Red Viper works with the filtered LCD screen on the 3DS to emulate the visual depth built into Virtual Boy games.</p>
<h2>More than just <em>Wario Land</em></h2>
<p>Red Viper currently doesn't have any "default" palettes to choose from, meaning it can take some manual fiddling to get multicolor games to look halfway decent (you can save your palettes on a per-game basis). Once you do, though, it's impressive just how much color adds to games that were never designed to be seen in more than a few shades of red.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>The higher contrast between the road and the racers helps make homebrew Virtual Boy <em>Mario Kart</em> much more playable.</span>
                    <span>
                      Kyle Orland / Red Viper
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>We've found that high contrast yellow or green can really help sprites stand out from the jet black backgrounds that dominate most Virtual Boy releases. Accent colors in the blue or purple range, meanwhile, can help set off background elements and make them easier to distinguish from the foreground gameplay. Those color enhancements can be more than just aesthetic, too; in a game like Red Viper, distinct colors make it much easier to distinguish enemies from stationary obstacles in the game's awkward wire-framed 3D.</p>
<p>After you're done colorizing all the Virtual Boy ROMs you've dumped off of your own legitimately purchased cartridges (cough), it's worth dipping a toe in the <a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/">impressive collection of homebrew Virtual Boy games</a> created by homebrew coders over the years. That includes impressive ports of games like <a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/hyper-fighting/"><em>Street Fighter II</em></a> and <a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/mario-kart-virtual-cup/"><em>Mario Kart</em> and original efforts like </a><a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/fishbone/">a cartoony fish-eat-fish simulator</a><a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/mario-kart-virtual-cup/"> or </a><a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/hamburgers-en-route-to-switzerland/">a hamburger based shoot-'em-up</a><a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com/homebrew/mario-kart-virtual-cup/">.</a></p>
<p>Whether you're a Virtual Boy aficionado or new to the world, the newly colorized Red Viper is the perfect excuse to visit this odd cul-de-sac in Nintendo's hardware history. Now if we could just convince Nintendo to release an official miniaturized set of Virtual Boy VR goggles <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/nintendo-likes-money-again-bringing-back-nes-classic-edition-next-summer/">à&nbsp;la the NES Classic</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The revival of NCAA Basketball from EA Sports aims to feature "all 350 programs" for the sport. At least, that's what EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he'd love to see when talking on a quarterly earnings call earlier this week.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-college-basketball-include-all-350-programs/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, Wilson was asked about the company's recent announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/">a new college basketball game after 16 years since the last one</a>. Like the reveal, Wilson stayed relatively vague with details, though he noted his desire to include every university. "We’d love to do the same for basketball [as the company does with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football</a>]. All 350 programs, men's and women's teams, the iconic traditions and rivalries, and of course, March Madness," Wilson said.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no set date for when EA's college basketball is set to release, though 2028 was mentioned in <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/memo-ea-sports-looks-to-bring-back-college-basketball-video-games-starting-in-2028-2029-0ef3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a memo obtained by Extra Points</a>. The last game in the series was 2009's NCAA Basketball 10. The sports franchise began in 1998 with NCAA March Madness 98 and only was known as NCAA Basketball for the last two installments.</p><p dir="ltr">There very likely could be competition with EA's return to college basketball, unlike there is for EA Sports College Football. 2K Sports is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-sports-reportedly-planning-college-hoops-standalone-game-not-tied-to-nba-2k/1100-6533301/">reportedly working on a standalone college hoops game</a>, too.

<p>Brand new Fusion system detailed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvelous has released two brand new gameplay videos for its upcoming sci-fi mech action game sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>.</p>
<p>The pair of trailers cover the action RPG's all-new fusion system alongside further info on its heavy armour sets. And it looks like the new fusion system in particular is something that should have returning fans excited.</p>
<p>You can also check out the heavy armour video at the bottom of this article, and we gotta say with all this drip-feeding of new info, anyone who's even remotely interested in big robot fighting fun-times should perhaps be getting a bit hot under the metal collar right about now.</p>

<p>Here's some further deets from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Fusion System:</strong></em></p>
<p>Abandon your humanity and gain power! The Fusion system allows the player to fuse Immortal factors, obtained from defeated enemies, into their bodies to acquire powerful abilities useful in combat. Factors are based on three categories: Might, Shell, and Skeleton, which determine the types of skills that can be acquired. The more Immortal Factors an Outer fuses to their body, the more skills they will have access to, while also mutating their body into something inhuman. Outers can restore their human appearance for a fee and the greater cost of losing all their new skills. The choice of whether that power is worth losing yourself along the way can only be made by you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Heavy Armor:</strong></em></p>
<p>Turn the tide of battles! The new, more agile Arsenal isn’t the only suit you’ll get to pilot in Titanic Scion. Customizable Heavy Armor can be summoned when the call gauge is full to deliver powerful attacks. Heavy armor, combined with robust weaponry and a strong defense strategy, can turn a losing battle into victory.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>A Titanic Evolution - Daemon X Machina’s high-octane armored action debuts on a new generation of platforms, bringing with it an epic sci-fi adventure, gameplay that’s accessible to newcomers, and an expanded scope sure to satisfy returning fans.<br>
Build a Better You - Now a nimble suit of armor, each Arsenal can be fully customized both in design and in loadout, with the ability to craft or salvage new elements.<br>
Together You Can Make a Difference - Cooperative and asynchronous multiplayer means players never truly fight alone. Team up with friends online to tackle the epic story and battles together.<br>
Beautiful and Deadly - Explore an alien planet in an Arsenal as players battle against mechanical and organic enemies. Trek through the vast open world on foot, fly through the skies, or when all else fails, gallop on horseback across plains, swamps, mountains, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion, is due to launch for Nintendo Switch 2 on Sept. 5, 2025, and we are excited about it!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-dungeon-gameplay-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rogue-factor-dives-into-hell-is-us-dungeon-gameplay-in-new-trailer-and-how-dungeons-were-built-%E2%80%9Clike-old-school-video-game-challenges%E2%80%9D.1257261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us is due out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-to-release-september-4-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">less than two months</a> from the time of this writing, and in its latest gameplay trailer, developer Rogue Factor showcases more of its dungeon crawling and exploration-focused gameplay, once again touting how the studio's goal with Hell is Us is to remove any of the hand-holding featured in other modern games, and make the experience of playing Hell is Us one where players are truly solving everything on their own.</p>



<p>Rogue Factor's creative and art director on Hell is Us, Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, narrates the video, and boasts that "<em>Hell is Us is not your typical action-adventure game. There's no map, no quest markers, and no hand-holding. Just organic exploration asking you to trust your senses."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We didn't design these dungeons as mere set pieces</em>," Jacques-Belletête continues. "<em>We built them like old-school video game challenges. Tight, crafted, deliberate. Every corner, every obstacle, every encounter, is there for a reason.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>If you missed the days were exploring a dungeon was memorable, this is for you</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hell is Us - Diving into the Dungeons | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuyrcRZ6COQ?start=216&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In an interview on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/30/hell-is-us-new-trailer-and-emotional-insight-from-the-creative-director/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Jacques-Belletête goes further into how every dungeon has a theme and emotion that's also tied to the larger story in Hell is Us, and to why the dungeon exists in the first place.</p>



<p>He also talked about how different dungeons will focus on different aspects of gameplay, so players shouldn't expect the same sorts of challenges when entering a new dungeon. </p>



<p>"<em>Some of the dungeons have a lot more puzzles than others, some are more about combat, and some have a lot of environmental changes, like the one in the trailer where you have to play with the water levels and things like that. So they’re all different and tied to lore, which you sometimes need to understand in order to solve a puzzle. One of our themes is ‘history always repeats itself’, and even though you figure out these artefacts from ages ago, you realize that it relates to what’s going on right now. There’s lots to discover and play around with</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, Jacques-Belletête does point out that players should pay attention to a rocky hill in the middle of the dungeon shown at the 1 minute and 45 second mark in the trailer. He tells players to "<em>See what's there</em>" and to "<em>imagine how many things it represents</em>."</p>



<p>Whatever it represents will be something solvable only by playing the game, but even still, it is interesting how so much of Rogue Factor's marketing for Hell is Us has relied on the studio emphasizing that players will need to pay attention to the details in the game's environment and to everything around them. </p>



<p>Even today, claiming that the game presents an "<em>old-school</em>" type of gaming challenge feels like the kind of promise the studio better be prepared to deliver on if they want it to carry any water with players. We'll see if players agree with Rogue Factor when Hell is Us launches on September 4, 2025. And in the weeks after, we'll see if Rogue Factor is being pressured by players to scale back the challenge it has presented in Hell is Us, and to add the kinds of features that it has called out as antithetical to the kind of game it is trying to make.</p>



<p>After all, FromSoftware has famously had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-14/">scale back the difficulty of its bosses</a> after players found them too difficult. It wouldn't be a surprise if players give Rogue Factor the same kind of pressure, though the changes required for Hell is Us would be far more substantial than a few tweaks to a boss fight. We'll see how September goes.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/715862/twisted-metal-season-2-review-peacock</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peacock%E2%80%99s-adaptation-finally-feels-like-twisted-metal-in-season-2.1257258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first season of <em>Twisted Metal</em> was almost like a prologue. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23806029/twisted-metal-review-peacock">Peacock’s adaptation of the long-dormant PlayStation game series</a> spent 10 episodes setting up its car-focused post-apocalyptic world and most of the major characters, all while rattling off a never-ending barrage of jokes. But it never really felt all that much like the games it was adapting. What it was missing were the silly characters and the vehicular combat tournament at the heart of the series. Season 2 finally rectifies that, and it was definitely worth the wait.</p><p>At the outset of the new season, much of the cast is separated. After completing his mission in season 1, John Doe (Anthony Mackie) is living inside a relatively safe walled-off city but is forced to train constantly to prepare for the tournament. (As part of his training regiment, he delivers pizzas under the name “John Dough.”) Outside, his partner Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz) has joined a post-apocalyptic gang that call themselves the Dolls, which, in a happy coincidence, is led by John’s long-lost sister, the aptly named Dollface (Tiana Okoye). Meanwhile, Sweet Tooth (the body of Samoa Joe and the voice of Will Arnett) is kindling up a bromance with his new buddy Stu (Mike Mitchell), who is quickly becoming an adept serial killer, as well.</p><p>What steadily brings everyone together is the tournament, in which the best drivers and killers face off with a tempting prize on the line: a single wish, which can apparently include anything, according to the mysterious Calypso (Anthony Carrigan). This attracts all kinds of characters, who all have their own big dreams. Quiet, for instance, has a utopian vision of bringing down the walls of every city so that everyone is on a level playing field. Most of everyone else has a more selfish desire in mind. The thing is, it isn’t until around halfway through the season — which spans 12 episodes this time — that the tournament actually kicks off in earnest. There are heist missions, qualifying rounds, and all kinds of other side quests before things really get going.</p><p>While this had me feeling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFBmIwlrPdY">a little like Milhouse</a>, the show does mostly use its time wisely, as it steadily introduces its new cast of combatants. <em>Twisted Metal</em> is a video game series about driving an ice cream truck with machine guns on it, so it’s not exactly well known for its rich, deep characters. But the show does a good job turning the brief sketches from the games into goofy and violent caricatures. That includes a very gross exterminator named Vermin (Lisa Gilroy) and a guy called Mr. Grimm (Richard de Klerk), who may possess supernatural powers or may just be losing his mind. My favorite is Axel (Michael James Shaw), who is described in the games as a man imprisoned between two wheels. In the show, he’s more of a man who is <em>becoming</em> a car, right down to the fact that he drinks gasoline.</p><p><em>Twisted Metal</em> has an inherently goofy premise. In season 1, it tried to force-feed that goofiness through nonstop jokes from John. But now, with a larger cast of ridiculous characters, the humor and silliness feel more natural and spread out. And once the tournament really begins — which, long-time fans will appreciate, happens to the tune of Rob Zombie’s “Dragula” — the action is much more over-the-top and exciting, as a show about cars with guns on them should be. Sometimes it can be a little CGI-heavy, but with all of the strange vehicles, weapons, and characters, it’s a lot of fun to watch.</p><p>Even though I’m only halfway through the season, what’s struck me most is how it finally feels like <em>Twisted Metal</em>, but smartly expanded for this new format. The first season often felt like a typical post-apocalyptic world with too many jokes and a killer clown. But with the addition of more delightfully weird characters and the car combat that comes with the tournament, the show’s finally tapping into that distinctive <em>Twisted Metal</em> voice that it was missing.</p><p><sub>Twisted Metal <em>season 2 starts streaming on Peacock on July 31st.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/715862/twisted-metal-season-2-review-peacock]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Chaos works in mysterious ways.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's boom time for Games Workshop, which has reported bumper profits across its business. But there are just two things holding the Warhammer 40,000 maker back right now: Trump's tariffs and a "cute looking" bat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the tariffs. In its latest financial results, the UK company behind the enormously popular tabletop wargames Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 announced such huge profits for the year that shares in the company skyrocketed to the top of the FTSE 100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But among the celebratory language around profits and revenue, Games Workshop moved to calm ongoing concern about the impact of tariffs on the company’s primarily physical goods business.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a note to the investment community, CEO Kevin Rountree acknowledged the uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs, but outlined his plan to deal with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our current estimate is that if we did nothing, new tariffs could impact profit before tax by c.£12 million (approx. $15.9 million) in 2025/26,” he admitted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new problem will be dealt with in our normal pragmatic way. We will not change our operational plans too much. We already have a U.S. corporate entity and we are investing in our base in Memphis and opening stores across most states. Some of our trade partners, staff and customers are nervous. So to be clear — it is business as usual for Games Workshop, once again a new normal has to be accepted. It’s mostly out of our control. We continue to manage our taxes in line with our policies and are monitoring the ongoing legislative changes in the U.S., and any potential impact on our effective tax rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Tariff costs are likely to reduce our reported gross margin next year. We have a detailed operational plan to make up the c.2% gross margin shortfall through efficiencies. This is not a simple task when we are already very efficient; it may take longer than one year. We will continue to invest in capacity to enable future growth (this investment is not matched by revenue increases in the short term). We will also continue to invest in necessary new jobs and gross pay (3% has been awarded for 2025/26, as well as increasing the base pay in the UK to £12.75 per hour, above the national living wage) and raise our RRPs on new products (the average was c.5% in 2024/25) to represent the significant investment it has taken to deliver them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so with the tariff talk out of the way, onto the fun stuff: bats. Rountree said that the exception to all the good news was the news about the aforementioned tariffs and “the cute looking pipistrelle bat that is delaying our work on our new temporary car park.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wait, what?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/gettyimages-539279208-1753884320516.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Chaos gods are involved in this somehow. Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, a real-life bat is holding up Games Workshop’s development of a car park. The pipistrelle bat, which weighs about five grams and is one of the most common breeds in the UK, is causing the mighty Games Workshop a bit of a headache. That’s because the company spent £2.1 million (approx. $2.7 million) on land for the temporary car park, which would be located opposite the site for a new paint production facility near its Nottingham headquarters, and Games Workshop has the option to use the land to increase its capacity in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Imperium had its way, the poor bat would no doubt have been scrubbed from existence without a second thought, perhaps from a well-placed bolter shot or, even better, a blast of psychic energy from the nearest available Librarian. But alas, in the real world, processes and “doing the right thing” appear to be important, and so, Games Workshop added, it was "carefully looking after" the bat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Games Workshop failed to say when work on the car park will be completed. Perhaps this particular bat has a bit of the Tyranid about it! But in all seriousness, one of the biggest challenges Games Workshop faces is production capacity. It just can’t make enough of its incredibly popular miniatures, which fly off the physical and virtual shelves so fast fans can find it near impossible to buy new releases. Fans <em>want</em> to throw money at Games Workshop for these things, which is why the company is spending so much time, energy, and money increasing its capacity — and is so mindful of tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, these two issues have not prevented Games Workshop from enjoying perhaps the most successful period in its long history. As we’ve reported, it even has an Amazon-produced, Henry Cavill-led Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe in the works (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-says-its-contract-with-amazon-prevents-it-from-revealing-any-details-on-the-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-shares-promising-sounding-update-on-scope-and-scale">although it can’t say anything about it due to contractual reasons</a>), blockbuster video games (Space Marine 2 has 7 million players), and a significant merchandise business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, now, it has a cute bat on its hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>"And really, the big reason for that is this isn't just a product. We're really building out Battlefield as a platform.

            <p>Have you ever gone on a nice hike with your friends, but then suddenly oh no! The climb is tougher than you expected. You must work together to make it to the summit, but now your tummy is rumbling and you don't have enough food. You turn to your friend, who once looked just like another normal human being, but your hunger has got so much that now they look like a succulent and mouth watering turkey. You take a bite…</p>
<p>Ok, if that has happened to you in real life, I am really very sorry to hear it because… well… wow! But, for developer Team PEAK and publishers Aggro Crab and Landfall, this isn't a horrifying fever dream. Rather this is, in fact, part of a new update for Peak, which adds cannibalism as a feature. Yes, that is what it says in the patch notes.</p>

<p>This latest update for Peak now means that if a player gets hungry enough, the other members of the climbing crew will begin to look like cooked turkeys (see header above), and they can be eaten. Many have shared their rather delighted impressions on social media, with comments such as "LETS GOOOOOOOO" peppering Aggro Crab's feed.</p>
<p>Cannibalism has been a long requested feature for Peak. I am not actually sure how it all started, but Aggro Crab once joked that cannibalism would get it social media fame.</p>
<p>"Guys we can't add cannibalism to Peak," it quipped earlier this month. It re-shared that same post when the new update went live, <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1950280291496710245">simply captioning it</a>: "Fine."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1950493639626367375">Landfall joked</a>: "Peak on launch day: Help your friends... Peak two months in: Eat your friends" (it added in a later post it has, in fact, only been one month since the game released).</p>

<p>Peak (which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds) is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>, where you can find the full patch notes. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing:</p>
<p>"Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/being-able-to-cook-and-eat-your-friends-thats-peak-gameplay]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I really enjoy word games. When I was younger I used to devour wordsearch books and other word puzzles. Be it wordle, arrow words, or crosswords, if there is a word puzzle around it is likely I will try and complete it. So when Birdigo came to my attention, it made sense to try it out. Billed as a game inspired by Balatro and Wordle, developers John August and&nbsp; Corey Martin set some high expectations, but does Birdigo meet them?</p>
<p><iframe title="Birdigo - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j-Gh1scTRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Birdigo using bird migration paths as the basis for each run. There are six different runs in total, based on different birds including Swainson’s Hawk, Arctic Tern, Ruff, Northern Wheater, Amur Falcon, and Short-Tailed Shearwater, and then there are daily challenges alongside. Each of the runs is made up of a different number of stops, with each stop having a score target to meet to move on. Fail and your run ends and it is back to the beginning.</p>


<p>When you start a run you can pick a different deck of letters, with many that have to be unlocked by meeting various conditions. The standard deck has no penalties on it, but other decks will have more of one letter and could also reduce the number of words you can play. Letters themselves have different levels from basic up to diamond. The higher a letter rank is the more flaps, aka points, it is worth.</p>


<p>These points are then multiplied by power, with this power set by the length of the word and which feathers you have equipped. Feathers offer bonuses like giving a set power addition or giving certain length words more worth than others. In addition to feathers, there are song cards which you can use to upgrade a letter’s rank, convert letters into other letters, or refill the words you can play. These can only be used once, while feathers remain active until you replace them by buying a different one in store or earning at a stop.</p>
<p>So, Birdigo is not all about submitting the longest word possible as if you’re on an episode of Countdown, but creating words that will maximise points with the higher level letters and powers you have. The power worth of word lengths increases every time you use a certain length five times. For example, if you submit four letter words five times, four letter words will have more power.</p>

<p>Birdigo is a strategy game where you are trying to maximise the worth of a word, so making sure you are following a tactic is paramount. You need to focus on the feathers that will provide the right bonuses to meet the way you want to play, but it is a lot easier said than done and progress is very slow, so much so that is can actually be quite demotivating to continue playing. For instance, the second run is 27 stops and you have to pass that to unlock the other runs. According to my in game stats, after eight hours I have completed just one migration and failed 36 after 794 words played and 265 stops.</p>
<p>There needs to be some rebalancing as Birdigo seems to have the same quite small collection of feathers and songs, meaning you are quite limited in creating a strategy, and putting one of the longest runs second in the order, instead of building up to it seems like an oversight.</p>

<p>Birdigo’s visuals are quite delightful with calm scenes showing birds nodding along as you score, and with more birds fluttering onto the screen as you make progress. The day and night cycle is great too with menu icons lighting up as the sun descends and nighttime comes. The music is very calming alongside this and does take some of the edge off from the tension as you go through a run.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Birdigo has the right foundations in place and there is a a great hook to it, but it needs a couple of improvements to make people stick around. Progression is far too slow and being stuck on one migration run for hours is demotivating. Having more feathers and songs may help to realise the charming potential of this game.	</p></div>

            <p>Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has launched into early access, and the developers have one of those old-timey roadmaps explaining how it will change before the 1.0 release, give or take a few teasing redactions. This being a game about miniaturised children fighting insects, of course, the road in question may be only a few metres long. A garden pathmap, perhaps? Let's have a look, then. </p><!--more-->
<p>Coming in a fall 2025 update, we can expect a building grid and quality of life improvements, a hotpouch for buggies, and a new boss called AXL, thought to be a spider. With AXL will come a new boss arena, crafting recipes, armor, weapons and furniture.</p>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 update in winter 2025 will introduce Steam Deck verification and cross-play features using a Microsoft account, plus support for rival handheld the ROG Ally. There is also talk of a new park area, a scanning tool called PEEP.R 2.0, a special damage type called Sour 2.0, and a new base-levelling stat, Cosiness. There will be new tier three equipment and omni-tool unlocks, together with a new mushroom set for base-building. Wash that down with a bucket of bugs: new species such as crickets and earwigs, and unspecified variations of existing creepy-crawlies.</p>
<p>The third big Grounded 2 update lands in summer 2026, and is all about swimming and ziplines. Also smoothies that grant status effects, watery bases, watery equipment (and some tier 4 gear and omni-tool unlocks), and some watery critters. There's an unnamed new park area on the way that is also likely to be aquatic in nature. Though I think it would be very funny if it turns out to be a large expanse of gravel.</p>
<p>After summer 2026, we enter the mist of Future Plans. These include more park areas, mutations, buggy customisation and progression, creatures, bosses, building options, and, well, just a whole lot of survival game junk, basically.</p>
<p>So far, the game seems to be doing well, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/">amply exceeding the original's launch player count</a> on Steam. We don't have a write-up for the moment, mostly because our team headcount is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">in the process of being miniaturised</a>, but freelance scribe Matt Reynolds has some guides to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-grub-locations">Grounded 2 grub locations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-thistle-needles-where-to-find">where to find thistle needles</a>, among other challenges.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The gaming world hasn’t talked enough about how it feels to get good at the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> for the NES. I mean, I get it, it’s a notoriously brutal example of “Nintendo Hard” difficulty. I still have nightmares about those endlessly respawning birds that boomerang relentlessly around protagonist Ryu Hayabusa. Yet with enough time, practice, and memorization, it’s possible to lay those hordes of 8-bit foes low in a split second of precise button presses. Once overwhelming challenges give way to the intoxicating realization of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that?” where your hands react faster than your brain can process what’s going on. If it weren’t for the next threat lurking right around the corner, you’d just sit there in awe of how absolutely cool you felt.</p><p>I bring this up because The Game Kitchen’s <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> is a pure distillation of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” with virtually none of the trial-and-error frustration that its predecessors demanded. Even if the developers hadn’t gone on record and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proclaimed their love for the series</a></span>, that deep level of mechanical understanding about what makes vintage <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>awesome would have been evident just from a few minutes of playing <em>Ragebound</em>. This team <em>gets it</em>.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>makes its homage to its NES predecessors obvious from the jump. Opening with the fatal duel between Ryu’s father and the mysterious gray ninja that series fans will remember from the first console <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, our story begins with Ryu taking up the Hayabusa family’s sword and heading to the United States on a quest for revenge. However, <em>Ragebound </em>immediately strikes its own path by instead following the story of Ryu’s protege Kenji, who stays at home to deal with the <em>rather small matter</em> of a demon invasion. That’s right, Ryu sticks around for a tutorial and a tricky boss fight that’ll put new players in their place, but afterwards he’s out for virtually the entire adventure. Vengeance waits for no one.</p><figure id="" data-id="7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-recommend-id="image://7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gameplay screenshot shows a blue-clad ninja attacking a large blue monstrous figure of some sort on a wooden structure in the water.

Just as The Game Kitchen had to carve its own vision for <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>with respect to the works that came before it, so too do we follow a hero who carves his own destiny using the skills of his master. You’ll miss a few references and leitmotifs if this is your first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, but otherwise it’s perfectly accessible to newcomers.</p><p>Kenji’s path eventually crosses with Kumori, a kunoichi of the Black Spider Clan that stands opposed to the Hayabusas. Extenuating circumstances force Kenji and Kumori into an unholy alliance, and the two embark on a journey that sees them facing off against both man and demonkind alike. The beats from here on out share similarities to those of the first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, even if <em>Ragebound </em>is a self-contained side story. The <em>Ninja Gaiden </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jisho.org/search/gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jisho.org/search/gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaiden</a></span>, if you will.</p><h2 id="h484403"><a id=""></a>You’re that ninja</h2><p>While Kenji may be Ryu’s student, he plays just as fluidly as his master ever did. Whether he’s climbing walls, dodge rolling to pass through otherwise unavoidable attacks, or bouncing off enemies mid-air to execute sick aerial combos, every button press feels impeccably responsive. And despite the impressive range of attack and movement options Kenji has at his disposal, they’re all made possible through a simple control scheme that wouldn’t feel out of place in an actual SNES game.<em> </em>Aside from a few <em>very </em>specific quirks (does my aerial attack have a cooldown?), I always felt in complete control while playing <em>Ragebound</em>.</p><p>And trust me, I needed every tool in the toolbox to succeed. The earliest levels aren’t afraid to litter the screen with bad guys to take down, giving me little time to react before I’d take damage. Yet nine times out of ten, before my eyes could register everything that was happening, I’d perform a flurry of jumps, rolls, and slashes that’d clear the screen instantly. It’s not like I just relied on one tried-and-true strategy either, as I’d intuitively try attacks that just felt cool to do in the moment, often leading to huge payoffs.</p><p>While I’d like to chalk this up to my hardcore retro gaming skills, those consistent feelings of being <em>so cool </em>are a testament to how impeccably balanced <em>Ragebound </em>is. For instance, most enemies can be killed in a single strike, but there are also bulkier foes who won’t go down from one single, standard slash. Meanwhile, there are also glowing enemies who can grant Kenji a supercharged attack that cleaves right through these more imposing adversaries. This setup incentivizes you to think about the order in which you wish to take out your opposition, and even in chaotic situations, spotting a graceful way to navigate the fray and deploy those supercharged attacks on more formidable foes felt easy and natural. It helps that <em>Ragebound</em> features such fluidly animated pixel art that reading enemy attacks and telegraphs is a cinch. I didn’t master every encounter right off the bat, but I’d have a good idea of what I should have done differently to avoid a hit or keep my combos going.</p><p>Most importantly, <em>man</em>, does <em>Ragebound</em> feel as good as it looks. The sounds of cutting through small fry never get old, and those moments when the action stops just as Kenji uses a supercharged attack to slice a huge foe clean in half <em>really </em>convey the weight of the blow. I rode a consistent stream of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” highs, whether or not I’d practiced a stage before. There were moments where I was completely immersed in a flow state, feeling just the right amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins as I played out ninja-based power fantasies I’d never actually realized I had.</p><p>And for all the ways in which its design elegantly encourages precision, I also always felt I had ample room to make mistakes, and <em>Ragebound </em>barely dwells on deaths before throwing Kenji back in the action. Rather than encouraging mastery through failure, the game feels <em>so </em>rewarding when played well that I never wanted to settle for a victory by the skin of my teeth. It helps that each stage looks and feels so distinctive that there’s nary a repetitive challenge to be found, even when bosses reappear later in the game. I could do without the two short vehicle-based autoscroller stages, but other than that, it’s all bangers here.</p><h2 id="h484404"><a id=""></a>I can’t believe it’s not Tecmo</h2><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> brilliantly evolves the gameplay of its vintage 2D predecessors in a way that feels fresh, modern, yet familiar all at once. I do wish I could say the same about its storytelling. I get that plot typically isn’t a priority in retro revivals like this, but the first <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>on the NES was a trailblazer when it came to narrative. The original manga-style cutscenes are well-directed given their vintage and limitations, and the story aimed high with surprise deaths, big plot twists, and a climactic finale. It’s nothing mind-blowing nowadays, but you just weren’t getting this kind of storytelling in stage-based action games back in 1989 (settle down <em>Astyanax </em>fans, I see you).</p><p><em>Ragebound </em>does start strong in this regard. The Game Kitchen utilizes its signature art style from <em>Blasphemous</em> to weave together some impressive cinematics that pay loving homage to the series’ origins. However, once the game enters its third act, the story mostly devolves into small quips between frenemies Kenji and Kumori with little else to keep the narrative exciting. I’d go as far as to say that 1989’s <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> actually makes <em>Ragebound</em> feel simple by comparison. There’s the occasional twist, but I never felt especially connected to what was happening on screen.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-recommend-id="image://9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image from a cutscene shows the blue-clad ninja looking distraught, his head in his hand.

The moment in question didn’t linger in a way that let me sit with what had happened either, which made the entire ending feel like clumsy tonal whiplash. Even completely disregarding the story, I thought <em>Ragebound </em>ended an act too soon. The set pieces in the end convey more “rising action” than “climax of the story,” a problem that I’m sure is observable by even the most dedicated cutscene skipper. By the time I hit the final boss, I was thinking less “oh this is <em>it</em>!” and more “oh, <em>this </em>is it?” It’s a bummer of a way to end an otherwise strong journey.</p><h2 id="h484405"><a id=""></a>It’s Blasphemously good</h2><p>I could certainly nitpick at <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> more. Hitboxes occasionally felt a little too big. I didn’t love a few of the enemy types near the end. The unlockable hard mode modifies an early game boss in a way that felt way too rigid, creating an awkward difficulty spike that the rest of that playthrough never wound up matching again.</p><p>Still, a few grievances and an underwhelming finale haven’t stopped me from returning to <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, even after I’d seen everything I’d need to write a review. The moment-to-moment action just feels <em>so good</em>, and there’s enough variety between stages to make mastering each one a unique, worthwhile challenge. I’ve never fancied myself a high score chaser or a speedrunner, but all I can think about as I write this is picking up my controller and chasing max ranks on stages. Not because I have anything to prove or unlock, but because I want to see what other combos or tricks I can pull off. In a modern gaming landscape where we often need a slow drip-feed of rewards as encouragement to keep playing, it’s refreshing to see a game with such high replay value simply because it’s that tight and concise. Just the act of play is its own reward.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>captures virtually everything that made 2D action games of yesteryear awesome while ironing out all the rough edges synonymous with that era of gaming. It looks spectacular, controls like a dream, and boasts levels that are worth experiencing over and over again. It does end too soon for its own good, and its short runtime may throw some people off. Aside from that, however, the developers at The Game Kitchen have proven themselves to be masters of their retro-inspired craft with this one. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>is a worthy successor to its NES predecessors, without a boomerang bird in sight.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/">Peak</a> is, despite being a game about climbing massive mountains in order to be rescued from a crash landing on an uninhabited island, generally quite a sweet-looking game. It also released a new update yesterday, within the features section of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391?l=english" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> quite literally just saying "added cannibalism." As developers Aggro Crab and Landfall put it, "Totally normal update to the game. Nothing to see here."</p><p dir="ltr">This update comes in spite of Aggro Crab literally saying it <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1940498163875696969" rel="nofollow ">can't add cannibalism to Peak</a>, but hey, the people get what the people want. Luckily, this new feature doesn't force you to Hannibal-style cut up the cute little avatars that are your friends. Instead, when your player character is too hungry, your friends' avatars start to <a href="https://x.com/ava_lamp/status/1950341032844923029" rel="nofollow ">look like a walking rotisserie chicken</a>. If you manage to successfully eat them, they turn into a skeleton (and die, unsurprisingly).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrlUVhLBjG0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jrlUVhLBjG0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, cannibalism wasn't the only thing added in with this update. In the options menu you'll find a few new additions, like the ability to adjust your field of view while climbing, and a push-to-mute setting ("No more having to listen to your streamer friend talk to chat"). There's also been some big fixes, one being a temporary solution to a bug that caused a lot of fall damage from short distances, and performance has been "greatly improved" too.</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Patch 1.10.a Notes</h2><p><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>Added cannibalism.</li></ul><p><b>Options:</b></p><ul><li>Polish and Turkish translations are in!</li><li>New Setting: "Climbing Extra Field Of View". This lets you adjust how the FOV changes while climbing.</li><li>New Setting: PUSH-TO-MUTE. This works the opposite way of "Push-To-Talk." No more having to listen to your streamer friend talk to chat.</li><li>Settings that were previously hidden outside of the Main Menu will now show up but be disabled. Hopefully this reduces some confusion!</li></ul><p><b>Balance Changes:</b></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Trail Mix, Granola Bar, Medicinal Root, and Airline Food would not give extra hunger reduction after cooked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where cooking something Well-Done and then stashing it would remove the buffs. For reference, the intended behavior is that Well-Done items give the same bonus as Cooked items. It's your warning before it burns :)</li><li>Remedy Fungus now also cures poison in addition to injury, because it seems like it would.</li></ul><p><b>Major Fixes:</b></p><ul><li>We have a temporary solution to the FALL DAMAGE BUG where you would take a signifcant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance, often from spamming the climb and lunge buttons. A more comprehensive improvement will come in a later patch. Let us know if you still see any weird fall damage behavior!<br>EDIT: It seems like this only addressed the issue when sliding down while holding the wall, but not the one where you are on a slope. Sorry about that folks, we'll continue to investigate.</li><li>THE NAPBERRY PLANT IS TEMPORARILY DISABLED. Some folks were having issues with lag and crashes due to our implementation of the Napberry Plant. Trust me its a weird one. While we work on a better implementation asap, the Napberry Plant won't show up in the level.</li><li>Performance at the PEAK is greatly improved. It was the dang wildflowers.</li><li>Fixed an issue where an item would get stuck in your "Hands" Item Slot. This issue happens when the server can't keep up with items that are swapped too rapidly, so a tiny delay has been added after swapping items before you're able to pick up a new item.</li></ul><p><b>Minor Fixes:</b></p><ul><li>You can no longer get the Bookworm Badge by simply reading the final page without the others.</li><li>Fixed an issue where reading the guidebook pages out of order could result in inconsistent stat tracking for the Bookworm Badge.</li><li>Removed an un-spatialized sound effect that would play when players landed from a fall.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Ticks counted as berries toward the Foraging Badge, lol.</li><li>Fixed an issue where an item in the temporary slot would display the wrong amount of Cooked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where eating a Scorchberry wouldn't contribute toward the Forager Badge</li><li>Fixed an issue where getting an Anti-Rope Cannon wouldn't get you the Esoterica Badge.</li><li>You can no longer obtain progress achievements (such as Beachcomber Badge) while you are a ghost. Reaching a new area while alive should grant you achievements for all the areas completed that run.</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Battlegrounds might be literally built into the acronym PUBG, but Krafton sees something far bigger for the battle royale game's future. The company wants PUBG to become a "gameplay platform" in the vein of Fortnite and Roblox--featuring various modes and even user-made content.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/krafton-pubg-unreal-subnautica-donkey-kong-darth-vader" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a> reports that Krafton chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae discussed the company's expanded vision for PUBG on an earnings call earlier this week. "In the age of PUBG 2.0, it will not simply be a battle royale game per se," Bae said. The CFO wants the game to turn into a platform, noting that they're "developing wide-ranging modes under that objective."</p><p dir="ltr">A major part of this transition will include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-getting-destructible-environments-and-switching-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6521738/">the switch to Unreal Engine 5 for PUBG</a>. Krafton has openly talked about this change since March 2024, with the Epic game engine opening up user-generated content to become a part of the experience. (Things have really come around, considering the PUBG Corp. once <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-getting-destructible-environments-and-switching-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6521738/">sued and then dropped a lawsuit against the Fortnite maker</a>.)</p><p dir="ltr">There is also a PUBG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/">spin-off in the works called PUBG: Blindspot</a>, previously known as Project Arc. The game is "a 5v5 team-based top-down tactical shooter," according to Krafton. Another spin-off in the same universe is reportedly an extraction shooter called PUBG: Black Budget.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-devs-lawsuit-demands-full-250-million-payout-and-creative-control/1100-6533246/">Krafton is currently embroiled in a lawsuit</a> with Unknown Worlds co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, who were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/">reportedly forced out from the developer</a> earlier this month. In the middle of this, Krafton has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-leak-is-real-krafton-confirms/1100-6533144/">confirmed an internal document leak for Subnautica 2 was legit</a>, pointing to multiple missed development milestones.</p>
