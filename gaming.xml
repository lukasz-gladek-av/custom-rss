Interestingly, the URLs for Walmart's new store pages for both editions mentions an exclusive gift; at the moment, the store page doesn't mention the freebie, so it's possible the URL is wrong about this. We'll update with more details as we learn more.</p><h2>Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Though Pokemon games have received in-game preorder bonuses in the past, the majority of Nintendo's first-party games don't come with official bonuses. Instead, retailers such as Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and GameStop sometimes compete with each other by offering exclusive trinkets. It remains to be seen if any other major retailers will offer a unique bonus.</p><p>If you preorder at the Pokemon Center in the US, Canada, or UK, you'll be eligible for a random Pokemon Sitting Cuties plush. Options include Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile.</p><div title="6529762 - Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3198" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle"

Hopefully the gap between the two isn't as wide as what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-deals-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-ahead-of-free-switch-2-performance-update/1100-6532029/" data-ref-id="1100-6532029">we're seeing with Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>. The latest mainline Pokemon games had rather extreme performance issues on Switch, but the free Switch 2 update has the open-world Pokemon adventure running at 1080p at 60fps.</p></div>                      </div><p>The sequel to Pokemon Legends: Arceus takes players back to Kalos, the setting of Gen 6's Pokemon X and Y for 3DS. The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.</p><p>Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.</p><p>Several features return from Arecus, including the ability to throw Poke Balls without needing to enter a battle--streamlining your quest to catch them all.</p><p>Along with the new and reworked elements, a familiar system will make its return after a long absence. Mega Evolutions, which last appeared in Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee in 2018, will temporarily turn your partner Pokemon into a super powerful version of itself. Mega Evolutions also alter the appearance of your Pokemon, but only certain species have Mega Evolutions, and you'll need a Mega Ring and a Pokemon-specific Mega Stone to activate it.</p><p>We've seen several Mega Evolution Pokemon in trailers so far, including Lucario, Ampharos, and Kangaskhan. Mega Evolutions were originally introduced in Pokemon X and Y, so it's cool that the return trip to Kalos will also have them.</p><p>The Pokemon Company's next Pokemon Presents is scheduled for July 22, so we'll likely see more of Z-A during the stream.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restock - Where To Buy The Console On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-325-lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-box-set-is-only-146-for-a-limited-time/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set Is Only $146 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-collectible-book-sets-are-up-for-preorder-myths-legends-tales-of-middle-earth/1100-6531796/">Tolkien Collectible Book Sets Are Up For Preorder  - Myths, Legends, Tales Of Middle-earth</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>The developers who create Guilty Gear, the punishing 2D fighters with slick anime visuals, are working on a Marvel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> in partnership with the comics giant. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> is a flashy over-the-top wreck sesh, at least judging by the trailer shown off during last night's State of Play, the showcase of new games by Playstation. You can very quickly see how punchin' pros Arc System Works have put their own spin on some Marvel staples such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Storm. There is a (to me) terrifying catch - the fights are 4v4 tag battles.</p>

<p>Wonderful. Total chaos. No idea who is even punching who. The 4v4 tag element is scary to me, yes, and the developers appear to anticipate such trepidation, seeking to reassure players that there will be means of simplifying fights if you are likewise overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game," said game director Kazuto Sekine in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">a PlayStation blog</a>. "We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together...."</p>
<p>Characters will have "normal" , "special" and "unique" attacks, we're told, as well as "ultimates" that align with their characters' particular wheelhouse. Ghost Rider does a lot of whipping, and his motorbike will make a violent appearance. Storm will cause a vicious whirlwind. You get the idea, but here's the full roster of fighters, because I know you want to see if Taskmaster is there (he's not). </p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Star Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Ms Marvel</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Doctor Doom</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems like a decent slice of the Marvel pie. Regarding their visual design, the developers reportedly went back and forth with Marvel, trying to stick to some traditions. But some honchos at Marvel kicked the designs back and insisted the devs do things their own way.</p>
<p>"Early on in the project, we experimented with a shader to recreate a more western comic-book visual style," said Takeshi Yamanaka, "but the Marvel team expressed a desire for us to lean into something more Arc-like. It was then that we switched our approach to the game’s visuals and began to lean more into the Japanimation style Arc is known for."</p>
<p>Makes sense to me. Arc System Works are generally well-respected fighting game developers among fisticuffs fans, having continued the Guilty Gear series for years, most recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>. They also made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, which contributor Aron Garst enjoyed in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-pc">review</a>, and the equally outlandish BlazBlue brawlers, which everyone at RPS is afraid to play. That includes me, the only person here who likes fighting games. I am not fooled by Arc System Works' words of reassurance, I just <em>know</em> Dr Doom is going to crush my windpipe and I won't get a single hit in. I'll stick to my beloved Tekken. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This disaster halts the flow of rune energy, causing the gods of nature to vanish and leaving the land in ruin. Players awaken as an Earth Dancer, chosen to fight against the Blight and restore balance and hope to the forsaken world.</p><h2><span>Bold New Abilities and Weapons</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_003.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Combat in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> has significantly evolved. As an Earth Dancer, players draw on spiritual energy through movement and sacred relics. The Earth Dancer class introduces a rhythmic, almost ritualistic fighting style that incorporates elemental dances to cleanse the land of Blight.</p><p>An expanded arsenal further diversifies combat—new weapon types such as the Bow make for precise ranged attacks, while the Talisman offers magical faire. Each weapon synergizes with Earth Dancer abilities, encouraging players to adapt their approach depending on the enemy’s Blight-inflicted form.</p><h2><span>It Takes a Village</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Farming returns in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, but it is no longer limited to just your own plot of land. For the first time in series history, players can take part in large-scale village restoration. After the Blight devastated entire settlements, it is your job to rebuild them from the ground up.</p><p>Through resource gathering, <a title="Genres > Crafting [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>, and strategic building placement, you will attract new residents and vendors—each with their own backstories, quests, and roles in Azuma’s recovery. And reconstructing infrastructure is not just cosmetic—it also unlocks new gameplay mechanics, items, and events.</p><h2><span>Your Fantasy Japanese Life</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese culture, <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> presents a beautifully crafted world steeped in seasonal charm. From snowy mountain shrines to blooming sakura villages, each location is tied to a distinct season and visual style.</p><p>Festivals and events integrate local traditions, minigames, and relationship-building opportunities, and serve as a means to deepen bonds, trade rare items, and uncover storylines.</p><h2><span>Classic Romance and Relationships</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>True to the heart of <em>Rune Factory</em>, relationships remain a central feature.

                <p>The battle royale genre dominated 2017. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, PUBG, Apex Legends, and other games came out around that time and took over the gaming zeitgeist. We're almost a decade out from the golden age of battle royales and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes it is the best shooter genre out there.</p><p>"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," Sweeney said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Battle royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented -- and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p>

<p>Sweeney also spoke about the fact that people still view Fortnite as just a battle royale and not an "everything game." Epic Games considers Fortnite a platform that includes creator-made modes as well as developer-created modes like Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing. Battle royale, including it's multiple spin-offs like Zero Build, is still the game's most popular mode.</p><p>"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><p>While Fortnite does include a number of other game types and genres, none have come close to the popularity level that battle royale has reached. In other Fortnite news, the game's Unreal Editor will soon get brick-by-brick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-is-getting-lego-brick-by-brick-building/1100-6532057/" data-ref-id="1100-6532057">Lego building.</a></p>

            <p>During last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play</a>, the show concluded with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. A superhero tag-team fighter from Arc System Works, the community of die-hard fighting game lovers celebrated the announcement, with some making comparisons to Riot Games' upcoming release: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a></p>
<p>2XKO, itself a tag fighter that has been in development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment">since Radiant Entertainment was acquired by Riot back in 2016</a> had largely had the tag-fighter space to itself for the foreseeable future, with the exception of the endearing but budget title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a>.</p>
<p>However, with this announcement, it looks like Riot Games has a real Marvel rival to contend with. Social media was abuzz with excitement for Marvel Tokon. Justin Wong, perhaps North America's most prominent Marvel vs Capcom player, <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930380603524034820">wrote</a>: "Holy shit MARVEL FIGHTING GAME IS BACK?!".</p>

<p>Yipes, himself a beloved figure in the professional fighting game scene and a legendary Marvel vs Capcom 2 player, was lost for words. <a href="https://x.com/IFCYipeS/status/1930382431057784971">He posted</a>, "!??!?!?!??!?!?!", an apt measure of the overall feeling following the State of Play.</p>
<p>This reveal brought with it immediate comparisons to 2XKO, due to the unavoidable rivalry between the two games. <a href="https://x.com/Alioune85/status/1930405418137727416">Former pro player Alioune</a> summed it up with "If « fuck you 2xko » was a game", whereas <a href="https://x.com/Nushinator24/status/1930382031797792861">one fighting game fan</a> on Twitter reacted by stating: "Game already has a bigger roster than 2xko".</p>
<p>Indeed in the run up to 2XKO's release later this year the game has been seen through a more critical lens following recent announcements and play tests. Game director on 2XKO Shaun Rivera revealed in a Discord Q&amp;A earlier this year that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why">2XKO will have 10 champions at launch</a>, a relatively small number for a tag fighter. That game currently has seven announced fighters, whereas Marvel Hokon blasted out the gate with eight on display.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can’t wait to play it.</p>— Shaun Rivera (@Unconkable) <a href="https://twitter.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However rather gritting their teeth or keeping thoughts close to their chest, several members of the 2XKO development team praised the new game. Unsurprising, as the team is composed of several former professional fighting game players. Rivera<a href="https://x.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550"> congratulated the Marvel Hokon team on the reveal</a>: "Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can't wait to play it."</p>
<p>Ben Forbes, 2XKO's editor-in-chief, <a href="https://x.com/draggles/status/1930380440315277393">shot out an initial</a> "oh fuck", before following up with: "sorry i was in meetings and had to pay attention MARVELLLLLLLLLLLLLL I'M THERE DAY ONE IRON MAN LOOKS SO SICK AAAAAAAAAA also star lord is dante???? LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO".</p>
<p>All in all it appears to be a "two cakes" situation, with two somewhat similar games clashing in the future resulting in more options for those who love diving deep into 2D brawls. <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930392702568317181">As Wong puts it</a>: "Too many fighting games what a time to be a fighting game fan".</p>
<p>If there are any companies catching strays right now, it's actually Capcom. The developer responsible for the Marvel vs Capcom series up until the poorly received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite</a>. Folks reacted to Marvel taking the IP to another company with the sort of humour you'd imagine. Take Evo champion Sonicfox, who posted the following image:</p>

<p>Ultimately Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls has made the next year or so dead interesting. Whether Riot Games can capture the hearts and minds with a live service approach, or Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls can cut itself a slice of the pie with some of its own boundary-pushing twists on the genre, is something the two will have to fight over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox's Summer Showcase</a> this coming Sunday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/05/xbox-game-pass-june-2025-wave-1/?ocid=XGP_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_6.5.1">Microsoft has confirmed</a> 10 games that will be making their way to Xbox Game Pass during the month of June, including a mix of games that will be available on Game Pass on their launch day, and older games that are finally making their way onto the service.</p>
<p>Regarding what's available right now, two classic RPGs are being added to the service today, the first two Baldur's Gate games. The Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are available on Xbox Game Pass console and cloud today, with the other eight games spread throughout the month.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-release-date-has-been-announced-june-13-2025/">The Alters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-launching-in-summer-2025-demo-available-on-steam/">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> are all launching into Game Pass and will be available in the service from day-one, while other notable entries into Game Pass this month include <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>, and Kingdom: Two Crowns.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of everything coming to Game Pass this month, and when they'll be available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition - June 5 - Cloud and Console</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition - June 5 - Cloud and Console</li>
<li>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition - June 10 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Barbie Project Friendship - June 11 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Kingdom: Two Crowns - June 11 - PC</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25 - June 12 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>The Alters - June 13 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>FBC: Firebreak - June 17 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time - June 17 - Console and PC</li>
<li>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die - June 17 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft also confirmed seven games that will be leaving Xbox Game Pass this month on June 15, 2025. Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dordogne - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Isonzo - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Keplerth - PC</li>
<li>My Time at Sandrock - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Depersonalization - PC</li>
</ul>
<p>With Xbox's big summer showcase event in just a few days from the time of this writing, this first batch of 10 games joining Game Pass this month might not be the only ones that'll hit the service in June. As Xbox has proven before, it's not adverse to doing a shadow-drop, with games capping off their trailers with a very welcomed 'available on Game Pass now' message. We'll have to see what Sunday holds.</p>

Players can wander around it to their hearts content in Free Roam mode. But they won’t be able to do it with a friend sitting next to them.

It showed players exploring different zones, attempting P-switch challenges, collecting coins, and discovering other secrets. “In Free Roam, you can also meet up with your crew anywhere in this game’s world,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/au/news-and-articles/mario-kart-world-direct-revs-up-new-details-on-the-biggest-mario-kart-ever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/news-and-articles/mario-kart-world-direct-revs-up-new-details-on-the-biggest-mario-kart-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a></span>. “Drive around, see where your friends are on the map and warp to them instantly. Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.”<br></p><p>While that’s not confirmation of local splitscreen, it did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some the impression</a></span> that free roam would be a multiplayer-friendly mode. But it turns out that’s not really the case. There are essentially two versions of Free Roam. One is single-player and includes all of the challenges and collectibles. The other is a glorified online lobby where you drive around in-between matches but there’s not really anything to do. And neither lets you play with another person sitting next to you.</p><p>Now, F<em>orza Horizon 5 </em>doesn’t support local co-op either. Rendering an open world is very resource intensive, and duplicating that for a second player in a second screen on the same system even more so. There are probably very valid technical and logistical hurdles that explain why Free Roam doesn’t have local splitscreen co-op. Is it still a bummer? Definitely. </p><p>As <em>Remap</em> co-host Patrick Klepek alluded to on X, the limitation will be especially galling for families who want to play together, or for parents with kids who struggle with taking turns. My own children, at least, love undirected play in video games. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are the games they spent the most time with for that exact reason. Free Roam was by far the thing that they were most intrigued with when it came to <em>Mario Kart World</em>. They like racing but they’ve done it before (and have trouble with losing). </p><p>Free Roam, with its undirected and uncompetitive gameplay, looked poised to answer both of those needs, making <em>Mario Kart World </em>something they’d love messing around in just for fun. Unfortunately, when it comes to multiplayer at least, the meat of the $80 sequel is still very much in traditional racing modes, just with some new open-world twists. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility feature is looking more interesting than expected before launch, as it manages to fix the massive performance issues of Batman Arkham Knight, one of the worst ports released for its predecessor.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2-back-compat-fixes-batman-arkham-knight-switch-1s-worst-triple-a-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the new-generation system from Nintendo, which has launched worldwide today, runs the horrible port of the third main entry in the series developed by Rocksteady without the massive performance issues it has on the original system. As such, the translation layer that is being used on the new system to run the original code has proven to be effective, allowing the game to put the better specs of the Switch 2 to good use. Ultimately, there's no fixing for the compromises the port's developer had to make in terms of texture quality and lack of antialiasing, and there are still some stability issues, but the fact that the Switch 2 can brute force better performance in backward-compatible titles is quite promising.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid game, Batman Arkham Knight has been somewhat infamous since its release due to the horrible state it launched in on PC, which required multiple patches to fix. The late Nintendo Switch port of the game, which launched last year, is equally infamous for being absolutely terrible, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">running at a whopping 0 FPS in certain scenarios.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally launched worldwide, but not everyone is having a good release day. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-here-and-for-some-players-their-consoles-are-already-damaged-thanks-to-stores-stapling-holes-into-the-switch-2-screen/">earlier today</a>, some early adopters found their unit's screen damaged because store employees stapled their receipts in front of the console's box.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have revealed the new gear that'll be arriving in the game with its next warbond on June 12, and there's an armour set that seems inspired by another franchise high on authoritarian satire, Judge Dredd.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm surprised it's taken that long for one of the warbonds - which as plenty of people have pointed out often amount to giving players a way to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">look even more fascisty</a> than you do by default in Helldivers 2 - to dip into something Dredd-ish.</p>

<p>As you can see towards the end of the trailer above, this armour set  - dubbed the BP-77 Grand Juror - will become purchasable from the game's superstore once this latest warbond goes live. There's a cape, pistol and player card to go with it, if you want to complete the look.</p>
<p>It's interesting, if understandable given how many HD2 players have been clamouring to dress up like Dredd, that Arrowhead's opted to sell this set separately to the similarly-themed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/05/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-launches-june-12/?sf277523410=1">Force of Law warbond</a> it's dropping the same day. Both are about looking like a militarised cop (or a regular cop, given the times we live in), after all.</p>
<p>As it stands, if you spend your Super Credits on the warbond, you'll get the usual little collection of fresh stuff all in one bundle. There are two armours - the medium BP-20 Correct Officer set and light BP-32 Jackboot set, the former of which looks to have drawn some visual cues from Robocop with the shape of its helmet's visor, potentially ticking yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">beloved satire box</a>.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there's the AR-32 Pacifier assault rifle and G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which sticks to enemies and downs them with electrical pulses. There's also the AX/ARC-3 'Guard Dog' K-9 stratagem, which is basically a gun taped to a drone that follows you around and makes sure an enemy doesn't lay down the law on your backside while you're distracted by some Super doughnuts.</p>
<p>As some of the folks on Reddit who're trying infer an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ko4aag/my_take_on_the_recent_warbonds_are_telling_a/">extra bit of story</a> from Arrowhead's warbond deployment have pointed out, it's arguably a bit weird to get military police gear just as the Galactic War's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">moved away from Super Earth's streets</a>. But hey, it's a chance to shout that you're the law as you take down some bots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The idea of getting a new game in the franchise, even after the woefully irrelevant <em>Thief </em>(2014), is thrilling. But god, no, not as some VR gimmick. But no, I’m not going to wallow! Instead, I’m going to take this opportunity to celebrate what we already have, and what we can still enjoy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Look, I’ll be honest.

Covering the embarrassing awfulness of Embracer Group’s handling of every property it mindlessly snaffled up, and indeed the mediocrity of 2014's peculiarly missing-the-point Eidos-Montreal-made entry, Fraser articulates why this is the opposite of what anyone should want to do with the franchise. So kudos there, and go give it a read. Although I will repeat the vital point here: sure, <em>Half-Life Alyx </em>and <em>Superhot VR</em> are great, and maybe by some miracle <em>Thief VR</em> will be the third game worth owning the tech for, but if you don’t own a PSVR2 hat, then this is a game that’s going to cost you $400+ minimum!</p><p>(And can I make clear, this is no qualitative judgement on <em>Thief VR</em> which I obviously haven’t played, nor is it one on the no doubt enormously talented, incredibly hard-working people who are making this game. I wish them the very best. I also wish they’d been given the chance to make a full <em>Thief</em> game that everyone could play.)</p><p>But we’re here to be optimistic! Yes, it’s horrendous that the rights to one of gaming’s greatest franchises—the games that began the stealth genre, and indeed inspired everything from <em>Deus Ex</em> to <em>Hitman </em>to <em>Dishonored</em>—are in the hands of a management so inept that the only ambition they have for it is to waste it on a VR game that only a handful of people will play. But that doesn’t make the original games disappear. They’re still with us. And they’re still utterly amazing.</p><p><em>Thief </em>is about a guy named Garrett. Growing up as a homeless orphan, Garrett is now a master thief, living in The City, set in a fantasy version of the Middle Ages; part steampunk, part wizardry. There are three factions: The Keepers, the Pagans and the Hammerites, with Garrett assigned to none, and willing to steal from all. The games see Garrett reluctantly get involved in the complex storylines betwixt the trio of groups vying for power, doing his best to have nothing to do with any of them, but profiting from the mayhem.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>1998's <em>Thief: The Dark Project</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an astonishing creation</a></span>.

Heck, <em>Thief</em>’s graphics were criticized for being dated when it was released in ‘98, and it didn’t matter then any more than it does now. Because <em>Thief</em> is a game about atmosphere, and by “atmosphere” I mean “darkness,” and it has that by the metric ton. Seriously, the textures on the walls in the Hammerite temples matter very little when the first thing you do on entering any room or corridor is snuff out all the torches. Light is your enemy, shadows your only safety, and you’ll immediately embrace the darkness.</p><p>It’s incredible how quickly this draws you in, how soon you’re entirely in the role, scooping up every piece of loot as you nip from corner to corner, bonking an enemy on the back of the head to slip through to a passageway. It’s totally absorbing, and absolutely compelling.</p><p>But what I think makes <em>Thief</em> such a stand-out game almost 30 years later is a philosophy that far too few games have had the courage to try: this is a game where the higher you make the difficulty, the fewer people you’re allowed to kill. Garrett absolutely <em>can </em>murder in these games, and should you choose to, you can go through a level killing each and every guard you encounter. But turn up the difficulty, and rather than the enemies getting stronger or more difficult to kill, you’re not allowed to hurt them at all! That’s revolutionary! It’s still revolutionary 27 years on. Instead of demanding better twitch reflexes or greater amounts of durability, the harder the game, the better you had to be at being a thief.</p><p><em>Thief II: The Metal Age</em> is very similar game, but in the best possible way. It’s more! It’s more of one of the best games ever! Where the first <em>Thief</em> rather over-relied on the presence of zombies (it was as if developers Looking Glass didn’t quite dare not to include a traditional gaming enemy), here there are fewer monsters and instead more humans to avoid, set in larger, more sprawling levels with astonishing variety in how you can approach a challenge. It was, I would argue, the emergence of the immersive sim.</p><p><em>Thief II</em> came out in 2000, when I was at university, and one of my most profound memories of the game took place outside of it. I had been playing it a great deal, just delighted to be back in The City, loving every second. On this particular evening, I was going to see a friend, and so I walked into town. As I went down the street, I found myself walking only in shadows, looking ahead to see where streetlights were shining, and calculating a path that would avoid them as best as possible. It was a concerningly long time before I realized what I was doing. (Another real-world symptom was starting to view the world by the potential of its rooftops, looking out windows to plan paths where I could get between buildings, before remembering that I probably ought not.)</p><figure id="" data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>2004's <em>Thief: The Dark Shadows</em> was, on its release, embroiled in some woefully unnecessary complaining. At this point, with the voice of the internet becoming an unavoidable thing, people were determined to find everything they could to be pre-emptively cross about. Looking Glass Studios, the legendary development studio that gave us <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Thief</em>, had tragically come to an end in 2000. Ion Storm Austin may have given us the extraordinary <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2000, but they’d also given us follow-up <em>Deus Ex: Invisible War</em> just a year before <em>Thief III</em>, a game that had unquestionably been restricted in scope by 2003's need to co-develop for the fledgling Xbox. (It remains massively underrated, but it also undeniably didn’t match its predecessor due to the wild constraints and tiny levels imposed by the weakness of the Xbox as a machine.) So people were ready to absolutely unload on <em>Deadly Shadows</em>.</p><p>Yes, the levels were smaller than in <em>Thief II</em>. Yes—and dear god, it’s incredible to remember just how much stupid asinine fuss was made about this some two decades on—the loot did glint. But <em>oh my goodness</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is an extraordinarily good game</a></span>. <em>Deadly Shadows</em> may not have had the acres-wide playing areas, but instead it sported some of the finest level design in all of gaming, boosted by stunning storytelling, and one of the most memorable levels ever created in any game ever, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cradle</a></span>. It was, and is, one of the most all-consuming games you’ll ever play, where you’ll lose yourself into the character you’re playing like nothing else, fearing all forms of light for weeks after you play.</p><p>So yes, it sucks beyond all belief that Embracer has the rights to this greatest of series. The company could be offering established indie teams the opportunity to craft a new <em>Thief</em> game in the spirit of the original three, or even trying to get the band back together and offering Looking Glass/Ion Storm alumni the chance. It could be doing so much, and instead its decision is to make a VR game that’s already buried under the logo of the unloved 2014 game that had so little to do with the games before it, for a format that most people are long over.</p><p>But it cannot take away what we already have, and that is something to be treasured. And right this moment, by sheer lovely coincidence, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get all three games for less than a dollar each!</a></span> That’s <em>incredible</em>! (You can even get the daft, goth-ridden, watched-<em>The-Crow</em>-too-much-as-a-kid 2014 <em>Thief </em>for $3.) Also, while you’re at it, play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thedarkmod.com/main/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Dark Mod</em></a></span> too!</p><p>And you should.

Inside, you’ll find nine booster packs from the expansion, each containing 10 game cards and a Basic Energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full-art foil promo card featuring Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet headlines the exclusive contents, tapping into the expansion’s narrative focus on the return of Team Rocket. Alongside the boosters, you’ll get 65 themed card sleeves, 45 Energy cards, a set of damage-counter dice, two plastic condition markers, and a competition-legal coin-flip die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set also includes a collector’s box designed to keep your growing stash of cards organised. It also comes with four internal dividers, a player’s guide to help you navigate the Destined Rivals expansion, and a code card for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-live"><u>Pokemon TCG Live</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the gameplay tools, promo card, and themed design, this Trainer Box follows the appeal of those from past sets to offer both style and substance.

Naughty Dog owner Sony thinks they are, and has used that as the basis of an official opposition to a trademark application for ‘Naughty Cat.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a Notice of Opposition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) against the “Naughty Cat” trademark application filed by a company called Naughty Cat Co., Limited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hong Kong-based company has two apps listed on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/naughty-cat-co-limited/id1628955285" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, both gambling “games” that promise to reward users with real cash. That’s a world away from the likes of The Last of Us and Uncharted, but that hasn’t stopped Sony’s lawyers from baring their teeth and barking angrily at their feline competitor.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/blog-header-copy-1749129008183.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Naughty Dog trademark has been in use for years. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In documents reviewed by IGN, Sony’s lawyers argue that the Naughty Cat trademark is “confusingly similar” to the Naughty Dog trademark it owns “in overall commercial impression and connotation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The first, dominant element of the two marks, NAUGHTY, is identical,” Sony said. “The second elements, DOG and CAT, are highly similar in that both refer to house pets and are likely to mislead consumers into believing, mistakenly, that Naughty Cat is affiliated with SIE and/or Naughty Dog or that its goods are licensed or approved by SIE and/or Naughty Dog.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opposition note goes on to insist that any registration of the Naughty Cat trademark is “likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake or to deceive the public as to the source of Applicant’s goods offered under Applicant’s Mark, to the harm and damage of SIE and the public.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Registration of Applicant’s Mark will lead the public to conclude, incorrectly, that Applicant is or has been affiliated or connected with SIE, and/or that Applicant’s goods provided under Applicant’s Mark are or have been authorized, sponsored, endorsed, or licensed by SIE. Issuance of any registration to Applicant for the proposed mark will result in damage to SIE and the public.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this, the Naughty Cat application claims a first use date of December 25, 2023. The Naughty Dog trademark was of course in use many years beforehand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-2193205407-1749128826313.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Here's a picture of a cat and a dog actually getting along.

Naughty Cat Co., Limited has until July 12 to answer Sony’s opposition. If it fails to do that, the USPTO may mark the application as abandoned and Sony will have their victory. If not, the dispute may go to trial in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems unlikely any of the developers at Naughty Dog will have much of anything to do with this trademark business.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-requires-pricey-extra-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-to-fully-complete<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Welcome Tour arrives today alongside the launch of Nintendo's new console, though it cannot be fully completed without also purchasing extra accessories - and a 4K TV.</p>
<p>The minigame collection has already drawn criticism for not being a pack-in game, considering it is designed to show off the capabilities of the Switch 2. Instead, it'll set you back eight quid. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime waded in</a> on the debate.</p>
<p>Yet as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/products/soft.html#other">Nintendo has stated on its website</a> (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-to-require-a-few-accessories-for-100-completion/">Nintendo Soup</a>), some of the 34 minigames and tech demos require peripherals which are sold separately.</p>

<p>One minigame requires a USB camera; another requires the GL/GR buttons on the Switch 2 Pro Controller (although they're also on the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip with the console); and a 4K TV is required for both a minigame and a tech demo to experience the proper resolution.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that all 12 areas of the game can still be accessed without these accessories, but to 100 percent the game you'll need three medals in every minigame.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back £74.99, an extra Charging Grip costs £29.99, while the Switch 2 Camera costs £58.99 - although a cute Piranha Plant alternative is £34.99 if you don't mind a poor resolution.</p>
<p>As for a 4K TV, that could cost you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Over in the US, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo even raised the price of its accessories to combat US tariffs</a> on the console itself.</p>
<p>"From my slightly extended but still brief time with it, it feels like Nintendo has created, if not the most wildly entertaining, at least the most spiritually accurate take on visiting an actual museum dedicated to a games console," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell on Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>"You read a bit, you play around a bit, you go, 'huh,' and have a little ruminate on what you've learned, and move on. If it weren't for all the Joy-Con waggling I'd ideally play this thing with my arms clasped behind my back, head slightly cocked to one side, assuming the official position of the museum attendee."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
