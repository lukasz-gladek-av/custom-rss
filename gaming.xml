Unity informed Game Developer it had taken down the stream midway through writing this story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the stream, which aired on June 24, 2025, Unity senior advocate for emerging tech Manuel Sainsily accidentally confirmed the current version of Unity AI is capable of generating assets based off copyrighted content—in this case, Disney's widely recognized mascot Mickey Mouse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sainsily and senior community manager Jackson Stevens had been responding to a viewer who asked what would happen if a user told Unity AI to generate a sprite of Mickey Mouse. Stevens stated he'd successfully tested the existing guardrails in his own time, but Sainsily said that Unity has "no control" over the asset generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Maybe the data might show some weird stuff," he said, before prompting the tool to generate an asset based on "Disney Mickey Mouse." Four images of the squeaky-voiced mascot then appeared in the asset library.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the incident, a Unity spokesperson stressed that one of the company's goals with its AI betas is to "make sure the right guardrails are in place to help prevent copyright issues, especially before those tools are generally available."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/keita-takahashi-sent-over-a-bunch-of-adorable-to-a-t-storyboard-sketches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the Scenes: Check out Keita Takahashi's adorable To a T storyboard sketches</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unity AI gives developers access to both our own first-party AI models and third-party tools (used to generate visual assets like 2D images and sprites)," the spokesperson said said, later confirming the feature shown in the stream was from a third-party tool. "Our first-party AI models are trained </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/jIKXClYvpnuPglpMGHGfDhzhoM0?domain=unity.com">only on licensed or open-source data</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—not unlicensed assets." They noted that third-party tools are being developed by external providers who may use models like Stable Diffusion or GPT-Image, "which means there's a chance copyrighted content could show up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The spokesperson said Unity is working with external providers to prevent such incidents, and that it is flagging the Mickey Mouse generation from last Tuesday's stream as part of that effort.

"The primary legal risk for developers using AI tools used to generate copyrighted images is that the output may be substantially similar to someone else's protected work," he explained in an email to Game Developer. "Even if the developer didn't intend to infringe, if it looks similar it's likely to draw unwanted attention," such as cease-and-desist letters, takedown notices, or a lawsuit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Legal risk doesn't necessarily stop at the source—it can often flow downstream."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity has done its best to reassure developers developers about the safety of its generative AI tools when it comes to copyright risks.

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Yesterday, as widely expected based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">earlier reports</a>, Microsoft began another sweeping round of layoffs - its fourth in just 18 months - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">affecting thousands of people across the company</a>. It's believed more than 9,000 employees have lost their jobs as a result of this most recent move, which Microsoft told Eurogamer were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>Since the announcement, additional reports have surfaced painting a clearer picture of the devastation wrought by Microsoft's latest cost cutting measures, as well as the substantial impact on its Xbox division. Beyond the significant human cost of the move - which Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> insisted was necessary to ensure the "enduring success" of the company in a message to staff yesterday - further details on the specific studios and projects impacted have now begun to emerge.</p>
<p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild, first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">announced in 2019</a>, has reportedly been cancelled, for instance, leading to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departure of studio veteran Gregg Mayles</a> after 35 years. Microsoft's troubled Perfect Dark reboot, unveiled in 2020, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">reportedly also ceased production</a> and its first party developer, The Initiative, closed. Microsoft is also said to have terminated its partnership with Crystal Dynamics, which was called in to help on the beleaguered project back in 2022, raising questions around how that team may also have been impacted by yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an unannounced ZeniMax MMO has reportedly been cancelled, while 200 people are said to have lost their jobs at the Microsoft-owned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> maker King, and nearly 50 percent of staff at Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 have reportedly been laid off. The full extent and impact of Microsoft's massive "organisational and workforce changes" are yet to become clear, with Microsoft only providing limited information to press. It has, however, moved swiftly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon">deny rumours of Phil Spencer's imminent retirement</a>, insisting the Xbox boss won't be retiring from his position "anytime soon".</p>
<p>With fresh reports continuing to surface around yesterday's bombshell announcement and its impact on Xbox, we've set up this rolling news blog to sift through the confusion, and to collate breaking news and industry reactions as the story continues to evolve.</p><div data-live="true">

<p>We have fuller write-ups of these nearly ready to go, incidentally. I was never quite sure about Warcraft Rumble but it's sad to hear about Romero Games. It also sounds like it's put the small Irish studio in a very difficult position too.</p>

I actually had a dream with Phil Spencer in last night, I assume because I went to sleep thinking about this situation, and in the dream I had to interview him. We got as far as the interview starting and then I don't remember any more, so I have no breaking dream-news for you.
</p>
<p>
But I woke up feeling sad about the whole situation. Sad, obviously, for the people losing their jobs. Sad to see decorated developers like Matt Firor, the head of Elder Scrolls Online (and once the co-creator of Dark Age of Camelot, an MMO that means a lot to me) leaving his role after 18 years, after the cancellation of a new MMO he'd been working on. And sad to read about Gregg Mayles reportedly leaving Rare after 35 years there. It's such a shame. I had thought Rare resurgent in recent years, after the success of Sea of Thieves, and I'd greatly looked forward to Everwild, and now I'm left bewildered and wondering what will become of the studio that's there. I only hope the people losing their roles are being offered generous severance packages with it.
</p>
<p>There was also a feeling of losing belief in Microsoft and Xbox. When Microsoft started buying up studios a few years ago, I watched it all enthused. I was really excited at the prospect of studios like Obsidian Entertainment and inXile finally having the backing of a company with deep pockets and resources. I was excited to see Blizzard wrestled away from Kotick, and curious about where Microsoft would take Bethesda. I thought it was a good thing. But of late it's seemed to be more precarious being a part of Xbox than not.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Something strange is brewing at Blake Manor. Set in 1897 Ireland at a remote hotel, you arrive to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane, but there’s the occult and strange mysteries to unpeel before the truth can be discovered, and there’s just 48 hours to go before a ritual will bring everything to a head in The Séance of Blake Manor.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKI7DVrhWL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Spooky Doorway cut their teeth on the detective mystery genre with the Darkside Detective series, but Blake Manor pushes things in a rather different direction. This is a sprawling mystery with dozens of potential suspects to rule out, a ticking clock that determines the flow and nature of your investigation, and obviously plenty of potentially supernatural goings on, steeped in distinctly Irish mythology.</p>


<p>The opening of the game, though, is much more guided and direct. The deep Irish voice of Declan Ward lulls you into the dour, sombre tone of this investigation, as he takes train and carriage to the manor’s gate. Trudging through the gardens at the front of the manor, the setting and thunderstorm is immediately evocative of this kind of detective story. It doesn’t help that a shadowy figure stood by the fountain suddenly bursts into a flurry of crows flapping away, leaving a shawl behind which humorously suggests it was actually seven crows in a trench coat and not a hunched-over old lady.</p>
<p>The lobby of the manor hotel is empty, save for traditional jack-o-lanterns carved out of oversized turnips –&nbsp;Halloween originated in Ireland, after all. but ringing a bell brings the sour-faced concierge to the table, whose appearance immediately raises questions. How did his glasses come to bear a large crack in one of the lenses? Why is he so tense and preoccupied with the time?</p>


<p>You can question him directly over Evelyn Deane’s disappearance, and follow up on the visual clues found by a bit of traditional point &amp; click screen scouring, but he’s evasive and preoccupied at best. Something about needing to deal with telegrams by hand…</p>
<p>As he retreats to his office, you can start poking around, but the deeper you investigate, the more time passes. There’s no ticking clock mapped to real time, but rather time will advance whenever Ward interacts with objects and characters in the game. It’s an interesting choice that might force you to be more judicious than is typical for games, where players often have a tendency to interact with anything and everything possible. Still, there’s immediately some curious clues to uncover. Poking around in the side rooms for luggage and coats, you can see something hidden behind an air vent, or overhear the concierge muttering about a busted window. There’s also the log book that you can snoop through to see if Miss Deane truly had checked herself out of the manor and left –&nbsp;unsurprisingly, this does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>The trick is figuring out how to fix the telegram machine, to bring the concierge out of his office and let you snoop within there, and that means constructing a battery from an assortment of electrical discs. A simple starter puzzle, but a nice one to make you feel ever-so-slightly smart.</p>
<p>Much smarter, of course, than when I just bungled into the office and got told to leave. Then I had the bright idea of going out and climbing through the window… except the concierge was still there, banning me from the hotel grounds and getting a dismal game over screen.</p>
<p>Not my finest moment, but quite hilarious. I got it right the second time round.</p>

<p>It was when heading to bed that the real spookiness started, a thoroughly demonic dream sequence befitting of the Overlook Hotel or Twin Peaks. It’s all brooding, dark and bathed in red light as you walk down fish-eyed hallways, and still absolutely in keeping with the graphic novel inspired art style through the rest of the game. The setting is rendered in 3D, but characters are all represented with eight-direction character art, while comic book cutaway panels give a distinctive tone.</p>
<p>It’s only after waking from a frightful night that the game starts to loosen its reigns on your investigation. Stepping out of the room the next day, after a loud noise startled the assorted guests, you’re greeted by all manner of potential suspects, coming from all manner of background and superstitions, and all with their own secrets to hide.</p>

<p>With so many names and faces thrown at you, having a physical pen and paper will no doubt be key to keeping track of everything, but the game does have built in tools within the Mystery Map. This neatly organises all the key clues and narrative threads that you’ve uncovered so far, joining them up for you in a colour-coded web that makes them easier to digest. At various points, you’ll have to make a deduction, filling in the blanks from a particular phrase using the clues and evidence you’ve gathered.</p>
<p>Alongside this, you also have a timetable that lets you track the known locations of all the staff and guests, automatically populated from things like a staff rota and messages you’ve managed to find between people. If you need to find a particular person at a specific time, this will absolutely help, and Spooky Door is building in a feature to let you rewind and retry portions of the game if you run out of time before the séance itself.</p>

<p>All too soon, our time with the game came to an end, just as it would broaden out to reveal the full scope of the mysteries. Having such a broad cast of characters to investigate, it will be fascinating to see how this gels with the game’s time limit. Certainly, there’s an implication from my brief game over that you need to not only save Miss Deane, but also save people from attending the séance. This is absolutely one to watch for fans of mysteries and puzzles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157118/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/chronicles_of_the_wolf">Chronicles of the Wolf</a> is a tough game to review. A decade or so ago, 2D Metroidvanias were rarer, but they now represent one of gaming’s most enduring and best-developed genres.</p>
<p>But how do I assess a production like this that purposefully ignores many of the design changes that made the genre more accessible? This meaty retro-inspired game will leave a lot of players battered and bruised, ready to give up and swan off to the nearest tavern in its rural 18th-century French setting.</p>
<p>First, an essential statement: Chronicles absolutely nails its aims. It seems to want to be <em>the</em> definitive old-school <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a>. It channels and improves on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania_ii_simons_quest">Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest</a> from the NES, but with a design aesthetic that lands somewhere between the SNES and PS1 eras.</p>
<p>As you head off on your adventures, you’ll explore towns, fight enemies and bosses, interact with villagers, interpret clues. But Simon’s Quest’s divisive characteristics — hints that lead nowhere, obscure and hard-to-interpret instructions — have only been toned down, not entirely removed. Chronicles of the Wolf is an improvement on the design, not an apology.</p>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157121/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game’s second section, which takes up the majority of the 20-hour runtime, is a dead ringer for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Symphony of the Night</a>’s castle location. That’s if you make it that far; the Castlevania tradition of hoodwinking and misdirection is alive and well here, manifesting in five possible endings and — I was less happy about this — multiple locations that lead to cheap, surprise deaths.</p>
<p>Forgetting nefarious tricks for a moment, Chronicles of the Wolf confidently forges its own mythology, separate from vampires, which allows it to stand on its own two feet.</p>
<p>You take on the role of Mateo Lombardo, an apprentice of the Rose Cross Order trying to rid the French countryside of the mysterious Beast of Gévaudan – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_G%C3%A9vaudan">a true-life creature</a> that terrorised rural communities in the 1700s, which in this iteration appears very much to be a werewolf.</p>
<p>The developer — Migami Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wallachia_reign_of_dracula">Wallachia: Reign Of Dracula</a>), responsible for the two highly rated <strong>Castlevania: Lecarde Chronicles</strong> fan games — understands what makes Castlevania tick, but it just so happens that Konami’s series often asks a lot of its players, which, here, is the source of my general hesitation about <em>who</em> I can recommend the game to.</p>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157115/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I love Metroidvanias. I’ve played more than my fair share. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> are two of my favourite games over the last decade, but these two examples seem pretty mainstream in comparison to Chronicles of the Wolf. Anyone who lacked the patience for either example need not make this visit to France. And if you <em>did</em>, then it still might not be for you.</p>
<p>It's not that Chronicles is hard – it’s not. Its combat is well-balanced, fun, and just challenging enough. But making progress can sometimes feel like a chore. Just as Mateo Lombardo moves through the game screens with Castlevania’s almost characteristic lack of pace, the game’s design demands genuine patience. For the right player, this will transport them back to the '90s – Chronicles of the Wolf feels refreshingly retro. For others, they’ll want to play something else.</p>
<p>Initially I enjoyed Chronicle’s specific flavour of exploring and backtracking. I was happy scrutinising the map for areas that I might be able to reach with one of the huge number of new abilities I was collecting along the way – the double jump, the air dash, feather boots that let me ride air currents.</p>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157116/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But given the vastness of some of the areas, and the smattering of fast-travel options, it feels inevitable that some players will miss a crucial hint or overlook a tucked-away item needed to progress. I feel as if these bottlenecks are more frequent here than most modern games would allow.</p>
<p>Your patience level for dealing with this kind of thing will define whether the game is for you or not. Personally, mine was tested multiple times, and by the halfway point, with so much of the game to go, my sense of having fun began to falter a bit. It’s a shame because smashing through skeletons, monsters, and acolytes with my ever-growing arsenal of weapons and attacks was genuinely fun, as was the platforming and the worldbuilding.</p>
<p>The game’s Castlevania-inspired (and therefore excellent) soundtrack did its best to keep my spirits up, and mostly succeeded. The bosses were enjoyable without ever causing me too many issues — as long as I stocked up on plenty of potions — and even ultimately minor technical issues (a bit of slowdown at two points in the game and a flashing black screen when I changed items in the menu, which seems to be a problem on other systems too) won't taint my final score below. In a way, they added to the retro charm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chronicles of the Wolf is a confident, old-school Metroidvania that asks a lot of its players. Its DNA is from another gaming era, and simply being a fan of the genre won’t guarantee you’ll enjoy it. If modern quality-of-life features like marking your map or being gently nudged forward are preferable, there are better options elsewhere.</p>
<p>But if you’ve got the patience to revisit a time when games were slower and more cryptic, and the pacing was a little more intense, Chronicles of the Wolf is like a rich, dark relic that you’ll treasure. For every player put off by its demands, another will embrace it as a worthy challenge.</p></section>

			<p>Proper usage of the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler can make the Nintendo Switch 2 punch well above its weight in terms of image quality and even surpass the Xbox Series S, as highlighted by the excellent work CAPCOM has done with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> port.</p>



<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series which debuted on PC and consoles two years back, highlighting how NVIDIA DLSS does a great job upscaling the image to 1080p in docked mode from the low base resolution of 540p. Though there are some issues like visible aliasing and flicker when characters reveal the background, the end results are considered better in terms of sharpness and image stability than those produced by CAPCOM's in-house upscaler used in the Xbox Series S version, which renders at native 1080 but doesn't handle image noise well. The Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game also beats the Xbox Series S release in terms of texture quality, despite the minor 1 GB differences in available RAM in favor of the Nintendo system. In other cases, however, the Nintendo Switch 2 version is closer to the PlayStation 4 release with no screen space reflections in Fighting Ground matches, missing depth of field, background NPC counts restricted to the standard setting, and non-interactive physics-based particles. In handheld mode, with a lower 360p base resolution upscaled to 720p and additional graphics cutbacks to keep the 60 FPS target, the game is even closer to the PlayStation 4 version, which is still rather impressive, for a handheld.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though obviously more powerful than its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving with some of its launch titles and upgrades to original Switch games what it is capable of achieving. The Splatoon 3 upgrade is particularly impressive, as it <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">increases resolution by five to six times</a> in certain scenarios while keeping the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, making playing the third entry in the series on the system the way to go to enjoy it at its very best.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot looked like an excellent addition to the immersive sim genre. Based on Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">previous shuttering of Arkane Austin</a>, I can only assume that this made Phil Spencer very angry. "Why can I lift massive crates but only fit one rifle in my inventory!", roared Spencer. Subsequently, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">both the reboot and studio The Initiative were axed this week by Microsoft</a> as part of their ongoing efforts to ensure their legacy going forward is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">destroying livelihoods</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">participating in</a> what a UN rapporteur<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session59/advance-version/a-hrc-59-23-aev.pdf"> describes as</a> an “economy of genocide”, and forcing Copilot inside that little plastic bit at the end of your shoelaces.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's a few great immersive sims from the Steam Summer Sale to soothe the bastard wound of Perfect Dark's cancellation. The bastard wounds inflicted on everything good and real by stakeholder capitalism, I cannot help with. Only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a> could fix that.

<p>Best of luck to all affected by Microsoft's slashing and burning.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaks</a> have earned it a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">Deadlock-style buzz</a>, but it seems things haven't been going well behind-the-scenes. A new report from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">Ars Technica</a> based on conversations with current and former developers details a budget that's beyond big, a campaign that's running "massively late" following a studio closure, and an unrealistic-sounding executive goal of attracting 100 million players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the report, the game codenamed Glacier is costing EA "well north" of $400 million, with that number being way more than any entry in series has previously commanded. The execs have their eyes set on competing with Call of Duty and Fortnite, so they've put plans in place for a single-player campaign alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">free-to-play battle royale element</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">classic multiplayer modes such as Rush</a> and "a community content mode" dubbed Portal all chucked into the big FPS stew.</p>
<p>That scale has reportedly also led the suits to slap Battlefield 6 with equally huge goals: "100 million players over a set period of time that included post-launch", according to one source. "Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," an EA employee told Ars, with another adding that "over about that same period, [Battlefield] 2042 has only gotten 22 million." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, believed to be the series' peak, has apparently attracted "maybe 30 million plus" in total, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-looking-to-bring-battlefield-premium-type-service-to-more-properties">shifting about 15 million copies</a> between its October 2011 launch and June 2012.</p>
<p>It'll probably not surprise you to learn, then, that "very few people" actually working on the game reportedly believe the 100 million figure is achievable, with much resting on there being "such an appetite out there for shooters of this kind that we will just naturally be able to get the audience that we need".</p>
<p>The rest of the report details the game's single-player element as running "massively late" following EA's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">February 2024 closure of Ridgeline Games</a>, something that could lead to a massive day one patch, delayed features and/or devs being pushed extra hard to fit everything in before deadline.</p>
<p>There's also reportedly tension between staff at long-time Battlefield developers DICE in Sweden and the newer US-based leadership team EA drafted in for the series, and Ars have heard "several first-hand accounts of people working on Glacier who had to take stress or mental or exhaustion health leave, ranging from a couple of weeks to several months".</p>
<p>All in all, it doesn't sound like a game that'll be fun to get over the line. We're wishing the best to the devs on the ground working on it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late]]></content:encoded>

<p>Where Winds Meet is an open-world action-RPG set during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period of Chinese history. Its combat and aesthetics are inspired by classic Wuxia fantasy, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">developers aiming to bring the genre to the west</a>.</p>
<p>A final beta test for the game will take place later this month, on 25th July for players on PC (via Steam) and PS5 across the globe. <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/007fb7/paper.html">Registration for access</a> is now open.</p>
<p>The test will include regions from previous tests, as well as the urban region of Kaifeng (pictured above).</p>

<p>The thing is, eagle-eyed fans have already discovered what the new pricing structure for Nintendo Switch Online will be, since specifics have already been divulged via the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/26lcooper/">26lcooper</a> over on Reddit, the new prices are as follows:</p>
<table>

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo of Canada is also changing the price of the Switch, Switch Lite, Switch OLED, digital and physical games, accessories, and amiibo. Given that the cost of NSO memberships has gone up, we can probably expect something similar with the rest of Nintendo's product portfolio.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-bet-on-the-wrong-horse-with-subscriptions-says-analyst-following-latest-round-of-layoffs.1234881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The main takeaway from the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">layoffs</a> may well be that Xbox is losing its multi-year battle to dominate the gaming industry with Game Pass.</p>



<p>It was in October 2017's earnings call with investors that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-game-pass-netflix-games/">told</a> the world that the company sought to replicate Netflix's success with a similar subscription service for gaming. Game Pass had launched a few months earlier, but Sadella's statement made it crystal clear that the company would go all-in with that plan.</p>



<p>To lure more users to Game Pass, Microsoft spent a lot of money acquiring new Xbox studios starting in 2018: Ninja Theory, Compulsion Games, Playground Games, Undead Labs, inXile Entertainment, Obsidian Entertainment, and, in 2019, Double Fine. All their games would launch day one on Game Pass, making it a very enticing proposition for consumers. </p>



<p>Over time, though, the Xbox division realized that this wouldn't be enough to convince dozens of millions of users to subscribe. To make a real impact, Microsoft decided to open its wallet and spend $76.2 billion in the consecutive record-breaking acquisitions of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, two of the biggest publishers in the industry. That gave them access to intellectual properties like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, and many more.</p>



<p>However, it quickly became clear that such franchises could not be confined to a single console platform, never mind a flailing one such as the Xbox. They would lose a lot of money by not putting those games on PlayStation and even Nintendo consoles. This led to the multi-platform strategy that a lot of fans have complained about lately.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Game Pass growth <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stagnated</a> well below Microsoft's lofty ambitions. Despite the overtures of Xbox executives, the subscription service still isn't allowed on Sony or Nintendo platforms, and its growth on Xbox consoles has reached the point of full saturation. PC Game Pass is growing, but it's not enough to get where Microsoft wanted, and cloud gaming hasn't taken off nearly as much as originally believed.</p>



<p>To delve deeper into the causes of this failed bid from one of the tech industry leaders, we reached out to our good friend Rhys Elliott (Head of Market Analysis at <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/">Alinea</a>), who shared with us some thoughts, chiefly that subscriptions just aren't a good fit for gaming.</p>



<p><em>Like many industries, gaming overextended itself following the black swan event that was the COVID-19 pandemic. During those difficult times, everybody was at home, interest rates were low, and engagement with – and spending on – games skyrocketed. The growth-at-all costs mindset became dangerous. Many companies thought that double-digit growth would continue, greenlighting risky projects and strategies and going on M&amp;A sprees. But the market is very different now, and many moves ultimately did not pan out. The games market has reached its maturity phase. Now, inflation rates are high, money is considerably more expensive to borrow (for consumers and companies alike), there is a cost-of-living crisis, and publishers have been forced to lay off employees and adapt to this new normal. But with Xbox, there is more at play.</em></p>



<p><em>The Xbox One was the beginning of those troubles, and Xbox has been in a constant state of recovery ever since. The Game Pass strategy was Xbox’s main remedy, but the games never arrived with the impact needed. Xbox bet on the wrong horse with subscriptions. Many proclaimed that subscriptions would become the de-facto way consumers access game content, just like Spotify, Netflix, and the like are ruling distribution in music and video. Despite companies’ best efforts, subscriptions will not be the main method of game distribution. For now, consumers – and the market – have spoken.</em></p>



<p><em>The reasoning is clear: the attention economy is already oversaturated, and consuming game content is more demanding than other mediums. A consumer can:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Listen to hundreds of tracks on Spotify each month</em></li>



<li><em>Watch dozens of movies / TV episodes</em></li>



<li><em>But the majority only has time to play a few games maximum – and that extends to even highly engaged players</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is just the tip of the iceberg about why multi-game subscriptions are only worth it for the most dedicated players:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Most gamers are already served by the free-play markets</em></li>



<li><em>Others are happy to buy a few premium games a year</em></li>



<li><em>Xbox was also following that trend on console despite a recent boost from adding Call of Duty to Game Pass, the service's new baseline</em></li>



<li><em>Subscriptions with day-one launch games are good for consumers, but they cannibalise game sales on Xbox’s core platform. And stagnating growth in that strategy has led Xbox to shift its strategy towards becoming a third-party publisher.</em></li>



<li><em>Another wrinkle is that Microsoft’s acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard were meant to reshape its gaming business. And they have – just not in the way many imagined. Xbox is now a giant publisher, with a back catalogue that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Fallout and many more. But the division is in flux, caught between its historic role as a console platform and a future that is increasingly platform-agnostic – third party. Whether this results in a more successful Xbox, or simply a more diluted one, remains to be seen. But I am not optimistic, truthfully. The Xbox of old is fading, and it’s sadly come with casualties. Too many casualties.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>There's little doubt that Game Pass has so far failed to be as relevant as Microsoft had hoped. There are just too many games on the market, and more and more of those games are continuing to get content for years after launch, stealing attention away from the new titles. There just isn't enough time to play all this content. Quality, not quantity, will win and get away with increasing premium prices. But let's face it, Microsoft never really managed to shine with quality games.</p>



<p>That is not to say Xbox is dead, but as others have noted, Xbox as we knew it is certainly dead, and its Game Pass push hasn't gone well enough to meet estimates. Furthermore, it was Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer who <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-championed-game-pass-even-against-his-own-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">championed</a> Game Pass at all costs, even against internal concerns. However, despite rumors to the contrary, it doesn't appear that he'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">retiring</a> from his position any time soon.</p>

            <p>Three former higher-ups at Ubisoft have been found guilty of sexually and psychologically harassing the women who worked for them at the company's Paris studio. A French court handed out suspended sentences to the three executives, as well as fines, the highest of which was €45,000. It's the final ruling in a sordid trial that has seen the men accused of forcefully trying to kiss female employees, ordering them to do handstands in skirts, and angrily throwing equipment across the office. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Former editorial vice-president Thomas François was found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment and an attempted sexual assault, as reported in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">The Guardian</a>. The court handed him a three-year suspended prison sentence, and a €30,000 fine for the crimes. </p>
<p>François was accused of tying a woman to an office chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. Another woman told the court how she was forced to do handstands when she came to work in a miniskirt. </p>
<p>"He was my superior and I was afraid of him," she said. "He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him."</p>
<p>At a themed Christmas party in 2015, François said he liked a female co-worker's 1950s style dress, then allegedly tried to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her. During the trial, François put much of his behaviour down to a "culture of joking around". Another Ubisoft staff member put it differently, calling the culture at the studio a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse">"boys' club above the law"</a>.</p>
<p>At the same trial, Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer at Ubisoft was found guilty of  psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment, although he was ultimately acquitted of the charge of sexual harassment itself. He got an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a €45,000 fine. </p>
<p>The court heard that Hascoët's alleged bullying behaviour includes ordering assistants to do personal tasks unrelated to their jobs, such as going to his house to collect parcel deliveries. The court heard how he once blew his nose into a tissue and handed it to a young woman working for the studio. "You can resell it," he allegedly told her, "it’s worth gold at Ubisoft." Hascoët's lawyer said that the former Ubisoft chief is considering an appeal. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Guillaume Patrux, a former game director, was found guilty of psychological harassment. He got a 12-month suspended sentence, alongside a fine of €10,000. Patrux was accused of a variety of harassing behaviour which includes drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, throwing office equipment around, cracking a whip near colleagues faces, and holding a cigarette lighter so close to a male employee's face that his beard caught alight. All three men had denied the charges.</p>
<p>The trial's verdict brings some level of justice to those women, although many complaints which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">surfaced back in 2020</a> have not necessarily been addressed. Back then Ubisoft responded to an outpouring of allegations that overwhelmed the company, saying that they would investigate those stories. When these and other allegations came up throughout Ubisoft's worldwide studios, some workers reported that HR had been informed, yet nothing ever happened. In the end it took the force of France's policing and legal system to do anything about it, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">the arrests in 2023</a> of the above accused and two other workers. We've asked Ubisoft for their comment on the verdict.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Glum is not your usual game protagonist. He has no chiselled jaw, no artfully coiffure ‘do and absolutely zero charisma. In fact, he’s a completely unlikeable stinky little goblin, which paradoxically makes him charming in his own way. What he does have, though, is the kind of feet that not even the darkest parts of the internet would pay to take a look at. It is fortunate that quite early in the game you’ll find a boot to cover up the offending appendages, as you’ll be spending a lot of time staring at that foot.</p>
<p><iframe title="GLUM | Official Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRQDbVo5oJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Glum begins with the titular ‘hero’ locked up in a barracks. Your first task is to find a way to escape and this takes the form of a well designed tutorial. You learn how to kick objects, obviously, but also how to use kicks to jump higher and even chain jumps together. As you progress you’ll also find a magical boot that you can fire off to reach distant objects and enemies. You’re not entirely restricted to kicking, however, as you can pick up some objects and carry them so that you can, well, kick them at things. Look, kicking is what this game is about, OK?</p>


<p>The world of Glum is bright and colourful and feels like it’s been taken straight out of a Shrek film. You’ll face hordes of armoured knights and archers, all just needing a swift kick in the face to conquer. Combat is made more interesting by the vast numbers of hazards scattered around the environment, from fires to iron maidens. Kicking foes into these reminds me a lot of the classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review/">Bulletstorm</a>, with obvious nods to the grandfather of kicking games, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.</p>


<p>As an Early Access title, Glum currently offers one major level to explore, as well as the tutorial area. This might not sound like much, but the map is fairly large and has a decent amount of hidden areas and secrets. As well as the core objective (in this case ringing bells to disturb the local commander) there are gnomes to smash and – <em>ahem – </em>&nbsp;mature magazines to track down. These unlock extra boots and abilities respectively and this looks to be one of the biggest areas of potential in the game with skills that can change the way you play hopefully added as development progresses. Finding these hidden items adds a welcome amount of depth and replayability.</p>
<p>Gnomes can be tracked down by listening out for their sinister little chuckles whilst the jazz mags are either hidden away behind intricate platforming sections or rewards for sidequests. These sidequests are appropriately bizarre, too, with highlights being kicking rats into a sentient campfire or feeding a chicken to a mysterious creature in a well. I don’t think Glum will be getting any PETA recommendations to be honest.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished the main questline of the level you get to face a wonderfully ludicrous boss battle that would be a shame to spoil. This encounter requires that you use all of your abilities to triumph and is a good demonstration of what the full game will hopefully offer. Once you’ve cleared the narrative part of the game there is an arena mode to enjoy, but an update killed my save so this wasn’t unlocked for me to try out.</p>
<p>This latter point is core to the Early Access experience. If you like the sound of Glum and want to support the devs as they bring it to completion then it’s well worth the price, but there can be snagging issues along the way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2235550/view/544485372295381678">A roadmap has been outlined</a> by CinderCat Games, with a festive clown-filled level, another arena mode, building up to a Halloween level this autumn.</p>
<p>It’s always important to know what you’re signing up for. In Glum’s case, I think there’s plenty of fun to be had in its current form and I will definitely be going back in for more once the extra levels are added.</p>

From Retro Fighters, the <strong>BattleDock</strong> essentially turns your Switch 2 into a functional GameCube (well, <em>sort of</em>) with the inclusion of four ports for wired GameCube controllers.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a replacement for your official dock, but rather an extension. So, according to the details on the Kickstarter page, your official dock simply slides into the BattleDock (dock-ception!) and is then connected via USB-C.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The priority here is low-latency compatibility with GameCube controllers for competitive play, with the pads fully supported with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>Included with the BattleDock are four magnetic covers to give it some personality. As standard, you get Spice Orange, Indigo, Jet Black, and Platinum Silver (though the Spice Orange variant is way more yellow than it is orange, in our opinion), but a stretch goal at $100K will also include Smoke Black, White, and Comet Red.</p>
<p>The campaign will be fully funded at $10K, and each BattleDock costs <strong>$36</strong> for backers (MSRP is set at $39.99). You can sign up now to be notified of its launch if you're interested in giving it your support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition to the UK government by the Stop Killing Games initiative</a> has passed the 100,000 signatures threshold to be considered for a debate in parliament. <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">A similar petition in the European Citizens’ Initiative</a> is also nearing its 1 million signature threshold to be considered by the European Commission.</p>
<p>The UK government already responded to the petition after it passed the 10,000 signature threshold in February, saying “We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued. We have no plans to amend existing consumer law on digital obsolescence, but we will monitor this issue and consider the relevant work of the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) on consumer rights and consumer detriment.”</p>


<p>However, a debate in parliament is always good, and UK residents will be able to have their voices heard on the matter through their local MP – if this matters to you, then firstly the petition remains open until 14th July to add your signature and receive notifications, and you should try to get in touch with your MP to add weight to this argument. EU residents have until 31st July to help this petition cross the line.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games is a consumer movement that came into being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">after Ubisoft’s announced shutdown of The Crew’s online servers last year</a>, arguing that many modern games “are sold effectively as goods – with no stated expiration date – but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.”</p>

<p>In the interests of game preservation and of simply letting people continue to play the games that they have paid for, SKG hopes to petition lawmakers to implement rules to prevent publishers from effectively killing games. This is not a call to for publishers to support games and host servers indefinitely, or even to release source code,&nbsp;but rather to provide an end-of-life plan for titles with core online components that ensure that the game remains playable in some state. In SKG’s proposal, this would still enable subscription-based games, MMORPGs, free-to-play titles and the many business models and styles of game that publishers have created, and existing games would not be affected, but plans would need to be put in place for future games to have this end-of-life version to ensure an offline mode.</p>
<p>For more on this, and the various edge cases and counterarguments that have to be catered to, please see <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">the Stop Killing Games FAQ</a>, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo">there’s some frankly bizarre and prehaps wilfully misconstrued pushback</a> which was recently addressed by SKG’s founder Ross Scott – this video arguably spurred these two petitions on to some semblance of plausibility.</p>
<p>And the thing is, we already have a practical example of how this is possible for publishers to do in the modern games industry, let alone with historical examples. Following the public backlash to The Crew’s server shutdown, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">Ubisoft pledged to update both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport to ensure that they have offline modes</a>, ready for whenever it is that the online servers are shutdown. While multiplayer is a key component in these games, they can also be played as purely single player experiences.</p>
<p>There’s further examples, such as Gran Turismo Sport having online-only progression at launch, but Polyphony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/gran-turismo-sport-server-shutdown-confirmed-for-january-2024/">switching this to local progression for single player for the server shutdown</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">Velan Studios made Knockout City private servers available</a> to the public, and more.</p>
<p>This should be the default course of action for companies to take, and we would encourage you to sign and follow these petitions, if you’re in the UK or EU.</p>

            <p>Hey, deez two. Sorry, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has just gotten a fresh patch following on from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-new-update-adds-in-more-weapon-variations-boss-challenges-and-oh-no-a-really-hot-portrait-for-narcissus">beefy Unseen update</a> last month. The big news? Supergiant say this latest batch of tweaks "will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch".</p>
<p>Damn, maybe it's time for me to dive back in and get some extra practice taking down those pesky sirens that try to smite you mid-gig like they're aquatic Van Halen. Ok, maybe I actually mean fire the game back up to stare at Narcissus. Sue me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512962085601150265">Patch 10</a> largely consists of tweaks to the stuff added in by the Unseen update, as well as some handy general fixes. That said, the most noteworthy aspect of its notes is Supergiant revealing: "We'll keep monitoring your feedback, though this will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch, whenever that will be!"</p>
<p>So, still no full release date for the godly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> yet, but further confirmation that we're getting perilously close to its emergence from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access</a>, which'll see Melinoë's story get its "true ending".</p>
<p>Anyway, to help tide you over, let's get into the highlights of this patch. Supergiant have reduced the chance of "successive attacks causing you to become 'stun-locked'", as well as making sure any temporary armour you've got from the likes of Hephaestus' Security System is chipped down by damage before it starts affecting your regular protection.</p>
<p>Several of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms and their aspects have been boosted up or tuned down. The Sister Blades' omega attack is now uninterruptible by enemies and the Umbral Flames' omega special projectiles do more damage, but orbit more slowly. The Argent Skull's omega special wave projectiles don't stagger folks anymore, and the Black Coat has had several aspects of it buffed.</p>
<p>Patch 9's Oath of the Unseen looks to have been rendered a bit more difficult via tweaks to the Vow of Frenzy and Vow of Scars, with the former drafting in fresh foes more quickly and the latter now reducing your recovery as intended.</p>
<p>Other changes affect everyuthing from boons, to Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and hexes. One other fix that's caught my eye ensures that "Heracles no longer sometimes ominously just stands around after his encounters". Maybe he's just been waiting for news on that full launch date, Supergiant. </p>
<p>Right, now everyone disperse promptly. We can't just ominously linger, Hades 2's devs might start digging into our code.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> won't be retiring from his position at Xbox "anytime soon".</p>
<p>Yesterday, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">swathes of layoffs across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark and a new Zenimax MMORPG</a> have been cancelled in the process.</p>
<p>However, Spencer - Microsoft Gaming CEO - will remain at the company for now. In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring">The Verge</a>, head of Xbox communications Kari Perez said: "Phil is not retiring anytime soon."</p>
<p>The news followed a rumour on social media suggesting Spencer would be retiring after the launch of the next generation Xbox, with Xbox president Sarah Bond set to take over. This is now confirmed to be false.</p>
<p>Spencer has led Xbox since 2014, and was promoted to Microsoft Gaming CEO in 2022. As such, he's overseen the company from the Xbox One years, including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> and numerous rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before," wrote Spencer in a statement confirming the layoffs yesterday.</p>
<p>"Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer discussed the decision to publish Xbox games on competitor systems</a>. "I'm not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore," he said at the time. "We're all so invested in where our games are, let's just allow more people to play. And yes, the 70 percent that we make on games on other platforms is helpful to us being able to build great portfolios, like we showed at Developer Direct, and I hope this will continue to show through the rest of the year."</p>
<p>Last year in an interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-made-some-of-the-worst-game-choice-decisions-says-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Spencer joked he'd made "some of the worst game-choice decisions"</a>, in terms of turning down some successful projects such as Destiny and Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>"I'm not a regrets-type person," Spencer said. "Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games. I could look back and say-," he clenches his fist, "-but no, I try to look forward and be positive about the things that we are doing."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard has announced that WarCraft Rumble will not be getting anymore new content, though there will still be support to address bugs and in game events. While it is not explicitly stated, this move could be another fallout from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">mass layoffs affecting all divisions</a> that Microsoft enacted yesterday. The biggest hits of that was the closure of The Initiative and the cancellations of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Perfect Dark.</a> Everwild has also cancelled and there have been layoffs at Rare, Turn 10, and Halo Studios too.</p>

<p>In a statement, Blizzard said,<em> “We have an important update on the future of Warcraft Rumble. After much deliberation, we’ve arrived at an extremely hard decision. Moving forward, we’ll continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content.  </em></p>
<p><em>Warcraft Rumble began development nine years ago as a love letter to Azeroth and launched back in 2023, reflecting input from enthusiastic players around the globe and the effort of a passionate team—some of whom continue to support Rumble or other Blizzard games, and some we’ve had to sadly part ways with. Since launch, Rumble has struggled to find its footing relative to our ambition for its long-term success, and for some time now the team has been listening to player feedback, refocusing in certain areas, and exploring different options. Some of that work showed signs of progress, but ultimately wasn’t enough to put the game on a path to sustainability.  </em></p>
<p><em>During this transition, we are focused on supporting our teammates. We’re deeply grateful to everyone at Blizzard and in the community for helping bring Warcraft Rumble to life and embracing the joy that makes this game so special. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us.”</em></p>

<p>The Microsoft job cuts yesterday lead to 9,000 people losing their jobs across the company. We hope everyone impacted is able to find new roles soon. If you have been affected check out<a href="https://gamejobs.co/">&nbsp;GameJobs.co</a> for roles available in game dev.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-%E2%80%98trying-their-damndest-to-replace-jobs-with-ai-agents%E2%80%99-according-to-one-developer.1234815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tensions are very high among Xbox developers after the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>, which appears to have removed hundreds of jobs across the whole gaming division. The Initiative and its Perfect Dark reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">are no more</a>; ZeniMax Online's upcoming MMORPG, Project Blackbird, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceled</a>, and the studio founder left; Rare's new IP, Everwild, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">canceled</a>, and veteran Gregg Mayles also left; and Turn 10 also saw the majority of its employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">fired</a>.</p>



<p>But it does not stop there. Engadget has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html?guccounter=1">reported</a> that five employees were also cut from Halo Studios. Furthermore, the report doesn't paint a favorable picture of both Microsoft's overall plans for gaming and the progress of future Halo projects.</p>



<p>The anonymous source understandably expressed contempt for Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's internal memo, which the executive started with the reminder that Xbox is registering record numbers when it comes to users, games, and gaming hours.</p>



<p><em>I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about.</em></p>



<p>The source also said that Halo Studios is now working with contracted studios across the United States and Europe, which they didn't really like.</p>



<p><em>Xbox in general feels years behind the curve in game development, and it leads to a lot of wasted time and effort.</em></p>



<p>The kicker came when they shared the impression that Microsoft is trying to replace as many human jobs as possible with AI.</p>



<p><em>They're trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents.</em></p>



<p>It is no secret that Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, and this very possibility has been dreaded for years. Whether it's actually the case remains to be seen, but it's certainly a worrying report.</p>



<p>Lastly, the anonymous source wasn't confident that one of the Halo projects currently in the works will meet the expected standard of quality:</p>



<p><em>I don't think anybody is really happy about the quality of the product right now. There's been a lot of tension and pep talks trying to rally folks to ship.</em></p>



<p>Just two days ago, Halo Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a reveal for their next project coming at the HaloWC 2025 event, which will take place in October. Needless to say, they cannot afford another blunder after Halo Infinite, else they might find themselves in the same position as Turn 10 - or even The Initiative - after the next Microsoft review.</p>

            <p>Edwin gave <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549930/Ostrich_Farm/">Ostrich Farm</a> header honours in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-mecha-break-ice-protest-charity-bundles-and-vibrant-ostrich-farming">this week's Maw</a>, and with good reason I think. "Breed vibrant ostriches", he wrote. I misread it as "breed violent ostriches" and got excited. I still liked the concept even after realising my mistake. I pinned the Steam page tab (aka "The Coward's Wishlist"), and forgot about it for a couple of days.</p>
<p>This morning, I clicked on the tab again while browser tidying. "I wonder how Steam likes the ostrich game?", I mused. One review. A single, negative review. "The performance tanked for me once I had around 70 ostriches and made the game totally unplayable".</p>

<p>I have questions, but I'm mostly just now more intrigued about the true nature of the ostrich game. Is this a normal quantity of ostriches to have in Ostrich Farm, or did the player implement some sort of rampant Muskoid breeding schedule? The maximum number of ostriches shown in a screenshot is 42 ostriches. It does not seem unreasonable to ask for 28 more.</p>
<p>I picture a single vibrant plume fluttering down to land on a fried motherboard, the air alight with dust-mote delicate feather fragments and the smell of singed components. How many ostriches must someone have before their world collapses in on itself, is not a line from Blowin' In The Wind but probably should have been.</p>
<p>I cannot rightfully say that the ostrich game deserves better because I haven't played it yet. One may argue that an ostrich game that cannot bear the weight of 70 ostriches has no right calling itself an ostrich game in the first place. Still, I feel many of the world's problems could be solved if more people realised that if 60 ostriches do not bring one happiness, it's very likely the extra ten ostriches will not improve the situation.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-performance-tanked-for-me-once-i-had-around-70-ostriches-is-my-new-favourite-negative-steam-review-of-all-time]]></content:encoded>
