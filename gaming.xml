<p>However, as rumours of a Nintendo Direct continue to build, a rating for the game in <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0">South Korea</a> (shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1m8u5ge/metroid_prime_4_beyond_has_been_rated_in_korea/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> subreddit) has fans hopeful that the game isn't far off.</p>
<p>The rating doesn't really give away anything, but it looks like it was filed on 10th July 2025 but was only published today.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 has been a <em>long</em> time coming, so many fans are scrambling for any sliver of information they can get. As always, a rating doesn't mean anything, so try to keep your expectations in-check.</p>
<p>But, as we mentioned above, the timing also lines up with those Nintendo Direct rumours, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">NateTheHate reiterating that one is still coming this month</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">VGC</a> has also said that reports of a Direct "match up" with what the outlet has also heard.</p>
<p>With next week being the final week of July, will we see a Direct? And, will Metroid Prime 4: Beyond get a release date? Time will tell. That <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-ad-claims-metroid-prime-4-is-out-now">London Underground poster blunder</a> got us all a bit <em>too</em> excited...</p>

                <p>Just a day after release, publisher 505 Games has released a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> that addresses several performance issues, fixes some bugs, and grants missing preorder bonuses. Alongside the fixes, all players will receive the game's original soundtrack DLC as a form of apology.</p><p>The patch notes detail the addition of a manual toggle for low latency mode, which is now no longer enabled by default, as well as VRAM optimization for lower-end GPUs. 505 Games says it has also fixed an issue where the game may crash immediately after the company logo during startup. It has also resolved a stuttering issue during finisher animations.</p>

<p>Other updates on the way include New Game Plus mode, which will be available starting July 29. Selecting this mode will reset your story and objective board progression, but you'll get to keep all of the skills, gear, and knowledge ranks you've earned, as well as your Hideout progression. You won't have to sit through tutorials on your playthrough, as you can fast-forward to the end of the prologue chapters.</p><p>The level cap is being increased from 60 to 80 for all players, and new Mastery ranks, Knowledge Skill ranks, and upgrades for all Hideout buildings--including new upgrades for Heiji's Forge--are on the way. Several big quality-of-life upgrades will arrive in a September update, before the Claws of Awaji expansion goes live. Here's a closer look at what's on the horizon:</p><ul><li>Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog will completely lift</li><li>The ability to skip time-of-day, jumping ahead to dusk or dawn</li><li>A new Forge upgrade level to reach Mythic--from Epic--and Artifact--from Legendary--equipment rarities</li><li>Hideout updates and upgrades.</li><li>Uncapped framerate for cutscenes on PC</li><li>Additional "goodies" that might be familiar to long-time series fans</li><li>Further bug fixes and stability improvements</li></ul><p>In related news, Ubisoft recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">Assassin's Creed Shadows has crossed the 5 million players mark</a>, and the company teased that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints" rel="nofollow ">could arrive on new platforms in the future</a>. The game has so far "performed in line with expectations," Ubisoft says, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/" data-ref-id="1100-6533378">live-action Netflix series adaptation</a> of the franchise is finally in development, five years after it was first announced.</p>

            <p>He plays Mister Fantastic in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but can Pedro Pascal actually <em>play </em>Mister Fantastic? Well, when it comes to Marvel Rivals, no not really.</p>
<p>The cast of Fantastic Four: First Steps recently got to take their Marvel Rival's counterparts out for a spin. Joining Pascal was Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), who all played NetEase's shooter with YouTuber LoserFruit.</p>
<p>It is fair to say though, that none of the actors were especially skilled when it came to negotiating the controls, with Pascal looking very much out of his depth (at one point he asks if there are "console classes" people could take part in).</p>

<p>But, one moment from this entire Marvel Rival's experience that has particularly captured attention, though, is the cast's reaction to Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which leaves very little to the imagination. "Thank you," Kirby immediately reacts with a snap of the fingers. "This is my favourite bit of her as well." She then makes allusions to a yet-to-be-greenlit sequel.</p>
<p>Her three companions, though, well they all looked rather surprised by the scantily clad image presented to them on the screen, which sees Sue dressed in what looks like quite a skimpy bikini bottom complete with a spikely-adorned top half. 

Pascal soon regained some composure, and simply said: "Costume designer, take note."

</p><p>This clip was shared by the Marvel Rivals social media account, and the cast's reaction has since gone somewhat viral. So, what do you think about Pascal and co's gaming endeavours?</p> <div>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

		<p>Another week is in the books, and we’re just a month away from Gamescom, so I’ve spent a good bit of time cleaving through emails and trying to put a sensible schedule together for previews and hands ons. Still some more to do on that front, but my calendar is pretty packed…</p>
<p>But enough about that, because with the cooler, wetter, windier weather, it’s been a good time for a game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/le-mans-ultimate-v1-0-can-fill-my-endurance-racing-void-this-summer/">Le Mans Ultimate</a> to come out, luring me to put on my fancy hat to check out a game dedicated to one of my favourite sports. It’s pretty darned good!</p>
<p>With a poorly baby in the house, <strong>Nic</strong> hasn’t played much this week, but did give the new Pokémon puzzle game a quick try –&nbsp;“It’s not worth downloading…” So let’s move swiftly on to <strong>Jason</strong>, who’s been playing an awful lot of the “basically perfect” Monster Train 2, but has also jumped back into Final Fantasy XV after losing his enjoyment for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy old week for <strong>Steve</strong>, as usual, and he’s been playing an unholy mix of Hellclock, Once Upon a Puppet, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/s-p-l-i-t-review-hacking-horror/">s.p.l.i.t</a>, while also having another two indie horror games on his forthcoming review list. We can also add in the Chibi-Robo spiritual successor Misc. A Tiny Tale, the classic CRPG A Necromancer’s Tale and a certain 2D Ninja platformer. It’s lucky it’s not term time right now!</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> week has been filled with Neverwinter Nights 2 Remaster and Peglin for review, but he’s also been playing Death Stranding, Civ VI, Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, and Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>Having been able to sneak a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, <strong>Aran</strong> has also had Birdigo and Atomic Owl on the go for review. It’s a rather different sci-fi zombie and horror future for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, though, who’s been reviewing Killing Floor 3, and sinking back into The Callisto Protocol: “I think I’m on the last boss battle I’ve kinda enjoyed the whole thing. However I never ever, ever, ever, ever want to see a character stand on a platform only to have it give way under the so they are separated from their partner, ever again. The game does it about ten times!”</p>
<p>While he’d been looking forward to playing it, <strong>Ade</strong> was thoroughly underwhelmed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> –&nbsp;“Maybe I’m just all soulsliked out?” –&nbsp;so it’s good that he’s been able to move swiftly along to Achilles Survivor for review, which offers an Ancient Greece twist to the Vampire Survivors formula.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing his car combat quest with Twisted Metal World Tour, where he grabbed the platinum trophy. “It’s a shame the genre has been left behind – Sony’s Destruction All-Stars was a fun time even if it had some glaring flaws.” He’s also been playing Wildgate, which has a rough onboarding, but which he’s enjoying for its spaceship extraction shooter shenanigans.</p>

<p>And we come to <strong>Dom</strong> to wrap things up, and he’s been playing a mix of Donkey Kong Bananza, Wild Hearts S and the recklessly titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/super-mario-party-jamboree-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. There’s also been some CarX Street, and some real life chess, which I assume means he dressed up as a bishop, went to a field, and moved diagonally when someone told him to.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>, the latest game in the long-running JRPG series' Calvard arc, has finally received a Western release date, and it won't be too long before you can check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>) will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch consoles on January 15th.</p>

<p>The game will follow on from the previous titles in the Calvard arc, namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date" rel="nofollow">Trails through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">its sequel</a>. You'll play as three protagonists with intertwining stories:&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel</em>'s Rean Schwarzer,&nbsp;<em>Daybreak</em>'s Van Arkride, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-heroes-trails-in-sky-3rd" rel="nofollow"><em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>'s Kevin Graham.</p>

Rean, Kevin, and Van are drawn into intrigue when Marduk invites them to "co-operate in a high-tech training exercise", setting them on a "collision course with the secrets that lay at the very core of Zemuria".</p>

<p>The game will feature an adapted and enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak</em>'s battle system, allowing you to swap between the action-based Field Battle mode and the more strategic Command Battle system.</p>

<p>New features include the ability to slow time with the Z.O.C. system, boosting your damage and allowing for devastating chain attacks, as well as new Shard Commands to grant your party "a range of benefits during battle".</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a sense of what you can expect from the game's climactic narrative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dying-light-the-beast/9p7zg9mqkkln" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

        <p>A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an "enigma of success"</p>

            <p>
Microsoft have published a memo recently sent to staff by CEO Sayta Nadella, which addresses the strange fact of Microsoft reporting net income in the ultrabillions while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laying off thousands of supposedly "treasured colleagues"</a>. Most of the blog is a gusty, jargony paean to generative AI technology, in which Microsoft have made vast investments, and how it is going to "empower everyone to create their own tools" and create a "local surplus" of Ability To Do Stuff in Microsoft dominions worldwide.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>

Nothing in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">blog</a> directly addresses what Nadella characterises as the "seeming incongruence" of Microsoft being richer than all of the Roman emperors combined, and still taking a blowtorch to video game studios like ZeniMax Online Studios, King, Rare and Sledgehammer Games. But I guess it's nice that they've recognised that the optics are weird.
</p>
<p>
"By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right," Nadella writes. "We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.
</p>
<p>
"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," he continues. "Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding."
</p>
<p>
Ah, whomst amongst us can fathom the dissonant enigma of trillion dollar corporations spontaneously having layoffs happen to them, while doleful executives float by on golden balloons, scratching their heads with bloody hacksaws. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sources-suggest-that-staff-laid-off-at-king-will-be-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-helped-to-create">reportedly</a> been replacing developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> with the generative AIs they helped to "train". Satya Nadella is apparently <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/the-surprising-way-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-uses-ai-to-consume-podcasts-on-his-commute/">a religious genAI user</a>, and I do wonder whether that's a "local surplus" of capacity that could justify some further cost-cutting, as per the glorious mysteries of progress.

However, in a press release published today, the developer has announced an eleventh hour delay to the zombie-fighting parkour game, moving the release date to September 19. It is “to allow for extra polishing,” including improving the UI, boosting physics, and tweaking cutscenes and player animations.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,195752,197562" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The follow-up to 2022's <em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human </em>was originally intended to be the second major DLC for that previous game, but after overenthusiastic fans unearthed and leaked everything about the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671?_gl=1*12ruh1t*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM0NDA1ODckbzIwJGcxJHQxNzUzNDQxNDIxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671?_gl=1*12ruh1t*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM0NDA1ODckbzIwJGcxJHQxNzUzNDQxNDIxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">the developers decided to entirely rethink the project</a></span>. This led to the desire to return to 2015's original <em>Dying Light</em> hero, Kyle Crane, now a super-human half-beast man, the result of ten years of brutal, tortuous experimentation.</p><p>Earlier this week there were a bunch of hands-on previews published across various sites, and given that a delay has been announced just a few days later, you might imagine significant issues were raised. However, from reading through a bunch of these previews of the first four hours, people appear pretty jubilant about what they played. In fact, Techland’s own statement notes the same, describing the mostly YouTube coverage as “universally positive.” However, it seems the developers spotted something the critics did not, as they’ve now decided to hold things back for an additional month of polish.</p><p>  “With just four additional weeks,” says the press release, “we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.”</p><p>Given the short nature of the delay, and the relative specificity of the intent, this does sound more purposeful than the the ambiguous notes you’ll often read when a game slips its release date. It does seem hard to imagine what can be dramatically changed in just four extra weeks, especially with elements as integral as the UI, but it’s definitely far better than receiving these improvements in piecemeal patches <em>after</em> the game’s released.</p><p>So <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will now be out September 19, in the safe release territory left behind after <em>GTA 6</em>'s delay into next year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-delay-techland-1851786943]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cailee Spaeny is reportedly in talks to star in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The casting scoop comes from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/cailee-spaeny-elden-ring-movie-cast-alex-garland-a24-booster-gold-writer-dc-studios-hbo-max">Jeff Sneider</a>, who reported Spaeny will reunite with director Alex Garland after starring in his 2024 film, Civil War.</p>
<p>Spaeny also starred in Alien: Romulus last year, in the lead role of Rain Carradine. Her voice and likeness as Rain were also used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> as a purchasable skin for Ellen Ripley. Prior to that, in 2023 she played the lead role in Priscilla, Sofia Coppola's biopic on Priscilla Presley.</p>

<p>So who might Spaeny be playing in the Elden Ring film adaptation?</p>
<p>We don't know yet what the plot will focus on and which characters will be included. A safe bet would be Melina, who acts as the Tarnished's maiden along their journey.</p>
<p>Other options include Ranni the Witch, Malenia, or perhaps even a female Tarnished.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">Elden Ring live-action film was announced back in May</a>, with Garland as writer and director. Garland is also known for Ex Machina and Warfare.</p>
<p>Heartstopper star Kit Connor is also said to star in the film, after featuring in Warfare.</p>
<p>Film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco are both behind the project, though it's unclear if FromSoftware or the game's creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> are also involved.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Atari 2600 was my very first home console. When my friends were playing on Megadrives and PCs, we were slightly less well-off, and that meant I was a couple of generations behind (let’s not think too hard about the gaming obsession I clearly developed after this). Still, I loved my Atari, and there’s a reason that classic games like Space Invaders, Centipede and Asteroids remain ‘classic’. They’re just great games. Perhaps the most iconic title, though, from the Atari 2600 era is Pac-Man and as the 35-year anniversary celebrations are rolling out, Atari and Bandai Namco have seen the opportunity to commemorate the event with a brand new Atari 2600 console. This rendition, named the Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition, takes the original, wooden-build of the first Atari 2600, and replaces it with bright yellow, Pac-Man-coloured plastics, while adding in the console’s first wireless joystick, also crafted in eye-melting yellow as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TP3JZ1RMdEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a fully-functional Atari 2600, so you can play any original cartridge. In the pack you’re getting the Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, a dual-game cartridge that includes Pac-Man 7800, a brand-new, arcade-style version of the classic, along with PAC-MAN 2600, the very first home console release of the game. I imagine that means the + in the 2600+ name means that there’s slightly more power on tap here than the original hardware, though probably not much more than is totally necessary. There is a non-yellow version already available, and the key improvement is that the 2600+ is capable of running Atari 7800 cartridges.

<p>There’s going to be a full range of wireless joysticks, with five in total, complementing the colours of Pac-Man’s ghostly adversaries, and they’ll cost £29.99 each. I assume that there’s going to be wider functionality for them, perhaps via Bluetooth or a wireless dongle, but there are few extra details on these right now.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release, Plaion Replai’s Commercial Director, Ben Jones, said, “The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console – it’s a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man’s unmistakable style, we’re celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play. We’re proud to bring this collaboration to life for collectors, fans, and a whole new wave of retro gaming enthusiasts.”</p>

			<p>Although WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike game through and through, the hardcore action role-playing game developed by Leenzee Games twists some of the formula's mechanics to offer something unique. Among these twisted mechanics are the block and parry mechanics, which work quite differently from what you may be used to.</p>



<p>Besides dodging, which you should master as soon as possible, as it is the best way to get the Skyborn Might resource used to use special skills like Discipline Skills and magic spells, you have no other defensive mechanics as you begin your journey to find a cure for the Feathering affliction. <strong>To block or parry an attack, you will have to make some progress in the game.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Blocking in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers in only available with Axes</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To block enemy attacks </strong>in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, you will need to find axes, as these heavy weapons are the only ones that can block. After equipping one, all you need to do to<strong> </strong>block an enemy attack is hold the L2 button on a PlayStation controller or the Left Trigger on an Xbox controller. Blocking will not completely negate damage, but it's still a solid defensive option as it doesn't require any particular timing to use.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deflection requires great timing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, but those who master it are mightily rewarded</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parrying enemy attacks in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a little more complex, as you get two different options to do so: <strong>Deflects and Clashes</strong>. Deflecting attacks requires you to learn a specific Discipline Skill available for Longswords, Dual Blades, and Spears, and to press the button usually used for blocking with Axe, so L2/ Left Trigger, at the exact time an enemy attack connects with Wuchang. A successful deflection completely nullifies the attack.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Clashing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a great way to mitigate damage while attacking enemies</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clashes</strong>, on the other hand, fit perfectly with the always-on-the-offense strategy you should often employ in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Instead of pressing the block button at the same time an enemy attack connects, to perform a clash, one of your attacks has to connect with the enemy's weapon, deflecting most of the incoming damage. Like for Deflection, you will have to learn certain skills on the Impetus Repository to add clashing properties to regular light attacks and to charged light attacks. Though damage is not negated with clashing, the timing is a little more forgiving than Deflection skills, so it's still a viable option to use, especially if you know enemy tendencies well and want to stay on the offensive as much as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared a new roadmap of content coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, including a release date for its Claws of Awaji expansion.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji is set to be released on 16th September, as paid DLC (though those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows will get it for free). On its release, Claws of Awaji will introduce a new region, a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. The expansion is said to be adding over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>

<p>Along with the Claws of Awaji date, Ubisoft has also promised a new game plus mode for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will go live next week on 29th July. This will also add new achievements and trophies.</p>
<p>Then, the team is adding various quality of life updates further down the line, which will include the likes of uncapped framerates for cutscenes on PC and the ability to fast-forward the time of day.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also added a line about unfogging the world map under this future update section. This seemed a bit confusing, because we were doing that already, but the studio has elaborated this unfogging line means: "Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog now completely lifts! You can focus your exploration on where you want to go."</p>

<p>Ubisoft recently celebrated welcoming five million players to Assassin's Creed Shadows. Along with those five million assassins, there have been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March. And it sounds like Assassin's Creed Shadows may soon be welcoming more players to Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">with a Switch 2 port seemingly being on the cards</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Assassin's Creed news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">earlier this month it was revealed that Netflix's live action adaptation is finally a-go</a>, five years after it was first announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-release-date-announced-new-game-plus-coming-next-week]]></content:encoded>

		<p>With a little less than a month to go to its previously announced date, Techland has announced that they are delaying the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> to 19th September 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/dying-light-the-beast-will-be-unleashed-with-an-august-release-date/">Previously expected for 22nd August</a>, the extra month will allow for extra polish.</p>


<p>In<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/516342322187731208"> the statement</a>, Techland writes:</p>
<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve been carefully listening to what you’ve been saying – whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve based on player feedback include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.</em></p>

<p><em>We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand. Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we’ve learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is.</em></p>
<p>The team promises regular updates through the now 8 weeks before launch, and a playable demo of the game will be available at Gamescom in Hall 6, so you can check out Kyle Crane’s return if you’re heading to the show.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a standalone game that grew out of the second planned DLC for Dying Light 2. Because of that, it will be available separately, of course, but is also still being released at no extra cost&nbsp;for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition. Techland have a great reputation for long support and consumer-friendly moves, and this is just another example of that.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">previewed The Beast back at Gamescom</a> last year, Dom saying “Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.”</p>

			<p>Borderlands 4 has officially gone gold, and will launch next month as previously announced.</p>



<p>Today, Gearbox and publisher 2K confirmed the fourth entry in the series has gone gold, securing its September 12 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Although we have seen games getting delayed even after going gold, like in Cyberpunk 2077's case <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/">five years ago</a>, these are very rare cases, so there's little doubt at this point fans will be able to get their hands on the game in a little over a month.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Borderlands 4 is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, but owners of the new generation system by Nintendo will have to wait until October 3 to play the game, as confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">earlier this week</a>. Considering the differences with the other current generation systems, it will be very interesting to see how the Nintendo Switch 2 will handle the game and if it will take advantage of any of its features like NVIDIA DLSS support and mouse controls, which would work extremely well for a game like this.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12. It will also hit Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to launch on August 22, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-smashes-through-the-zombie-horde-in-august/1100-6532167/" data-ref-id="1100-6532167">Dying Light: The Beast is a new standalone adventure</a> that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the protagonist from the first game in the series. Hellbent on revenge after a decade of captivity and horrific genetic experimentation performed on him by a sinister figure known as the Baron, Crane eventually manages to break free from his prison.</p><p>Tracking the Baron to the once-bustling tourist destination of Castor Woods, Crane finds hordes of infected standing in his way. Fortunately, he has more than just parkour skills at his disposal, as the Baron's experiments have given him new rage-fueled powers that allow him to smash his way through zombies. When that's not enough, Crane can also rely on good ol' guns and melee weapons to even the odds.</p><p>"Dying Light: The Beast benefits from years of updates to Dying Light 2, while also pulling in elements from the first that Techland wanted to revisit." Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">preview of the game</a>. "This mix of old and new feels like it's going to make the 20-hour game--40 to 60 for completionists--well worth it if you're already invested in the series.</p>

            <p>Troy Baker has had many video game roles over the years. He is Indiana Jones in The Great Circle, he is Sam Drake in the Uncharted series, he is Booker Dewitt in Bioshock, he is Higgs in Death Stranding… The list goes on (and on and on and on).</p>
<p>One of his most famous roles, though, is Joel in The Last of Us. Baker portrayed the cynical smuggler turned surrogate father in 2013's original release, before reprising his role in 2020's sequel. But, while Joel may have elevated Baker's career, the actor has admitted he was "woefully unprepared" for the part.</p>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe0xVuIcxMw">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon New Orleans 2025</a>, Baker was asked if playing Joel had affected him personally, to which Baker jokingly quipped "you're trying to make me cry". He then elaborated on his role further, saying it had affected him "deeply" in many different ways.</p>
<p>"There's nothing worse, and I hope that no one ever feels this… [but] do you ever show up to something and go 'I am so woefully unprepared for this'? And, it's not imposter syndrome, it's a fact. You are not equipped to do the thing that you are about to do," Baker said. "You could be like, 'let's go bungie jumping!', and then you get on the platform and you go, 'I can't do this'. That was The Last of Us for me. You get the gig, and then you go, 'oh no, I have to deliver this'."</p>
<p>Baker recalled going through the script and pitch in the early days of The Last of Us with the development team and his co-star Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie in the games. During a break, Baker turned to Johnson and said: "'Do you realise that if this thing sucks, it's our fault?'"</p>
<p>He noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> already had had great success with its Uncharted games, and the studio now knew the story it wanted to tell next. "We knew that what they were going to make was going to be good," Baker recalled, so now the pressure was on him and Johnson to deliver a worthy performance.</p>
<p>The Last of Us "taught me how to be a better actor", Baker continued. "It taught me how to stop trying to convince people that I could act, and just realise that Joel has no idea that he's in a game, and he's just in a moment in his life. And, I took that lesson, and I apply it all the way across."</p>

<p>Baker more recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, where he reprised his role of Higgs. Earlier this month, he was also announced as the voice of Jack Pepper, <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1944561535625605444">the lead protagonist of Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a>.</p>
<p>As for Naughty Dog and The Last of Us, the studio recently announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way">book containing the video game scripts for both of Naughty Dog's games</a>, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released. Away from its post-apocalyptical series, it's also working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">which stars Tati Gabrielle as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/troy-baker-wasnt-ready-for-the-last-of-us-admits-he-was-woefully-unprepared-for-playing-joel]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-cars-3">Project Cars 3</a> will be delisted in August and the servers shutdown in early 2026. This brings an end to the Project Cars franchise, with the first two titles in the series having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/24/project-cars-games-are-being-delisted-from-sale/">delisted in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on the game’s Steam page, it was announced:</p>


<p><em>Update on PROJECT CARS 3. All product sales will end on: August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC. Please note that times may vary by region. If you bought the game digitally it will remain in your library and can be redownloaded in the future. Any DLCs purchased before August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC will still be available to use after this date. The game’s online modes will also remain active until February 24th, 2026.</em></p>
<p>While a reason for this was not given, the most likely situation is the one that affects almost all racing games, as licenses for cars, tracks and soundtracks expire. With reduced income from games several years after release, it rarely makes financial sense for companies to review the game-specific licensing deals that are cut with manufacturers and tracks.</p>
<p>The sad part of this is that it’s an end to what was a real bolt from the blue for the sim racing genre. Launching in 2015, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/11/project-cars-review/">Project Cars was an imperfect, but refreshingly different take</a> on the sim and simcade racer, and gained a healthy fanbase on the PS4 and Xbox One generation, two years before Gran Turismo Sport arrived, and at a time when Forza Motorsport was still a lighter style of racer. It was quickly followed up by a sequel in 2017, but then things went a little bit off the rails.</p>

<p>SMS was acquired in 2019 by Codemasters ahead of the 2020 release of Project Cars 3. That game took a turn towards more arcade racing that didn’t meet the same audience as the previous titles, and with Codemasters subsequently acquired by EA, their sim racing endeavours were eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/the-project-cars-franchise-has-been-cancelled-by-ea/">cancelled in 2022</a> and the team broken up or laid off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, SMS founder Ian Bell had left and gone on to found Straight4 Studios (previously branded as Mildly Annoyed Studios). They’re currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/project-motor-racing-races-to-a-november-launch-with-an-intriguing-single-player-career/">Project Motor Racing</a>, putting even more focus on motorsports and with a November release date.</p>
<p>In our review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/24/project-cars-3-review/?cmpscreen">Project Cars 3</a>, Thomas wrote, “Project CARS 3 suffers from a case of mistaken identity. Once you adjust to the new direction, you can get into a fun flow of ticking off objectives, drifting around hairpins and purchasing upgrades. However, while the series’ existing platform means you get a great variety of circuits, cars and weather conditions, it also shackles this game from being a great arcade racing experience.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light: The Beast Receives Four-Week Delay to September 19]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has just announced a four-week delay for its upcoming first-person open world action/adventure game Dying Light: The Beast. The game was scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on August 22</a> and will now be released on September 19. As you might expect, the reason is that it needs more polish (no pun intended).</p>



<p>The team shared a message with the Dying Light community:</p>



<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>



<p><em>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Dying Light 2: Stay Human wasn't as well received as the first game. Granted, Techland kept working on it and improving it for years, but the early reception certainly left a mark on the Polish studio. They would not want a repeat of that.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was recently featured in a fresh round of previews, including a hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on Wccftech</a> and written by Kai Tatsumoto. If you're attending Gamescom, the game will be playable in Hall 6. Even if you're not going to Cologne, Techland will continue to share more information about the game. Next week, they'll publish a new development diary about how they handled gore in this new title, narrated by the fan-favorite 'Bober the Beaver'.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slots-and-daggers">Slots &amp; Daggers</a> is by Friedemann, whose previous game was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-teeny-tiny-townbuilder-is-the-pint-sized-townscaper-ive-been-waiting-for">Katharine-approved</a> tiny townbuilder. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/summerhouse">Summerhouse</a>. "After my last game, I wanted to make something radically different," says Friedemann. "Something faster, with numbers, fights and goblins!". Angry caffeinated math goblins, you say? Here are some other features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3631290/Slots__Daggers">from Steam</a>.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fun slot machine</li>
<li>Weird fantasy world</li>
<li>Crude drawings of strange little guys</li>
<li>Retro visuals</li>
<li>Crunchy hip hop drum machines</li>
<li>Addictive arcade gameplay that goes “pling” a lot</li>
<li>Numbers! Fights! Goblins!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"To make this game I combined a lot of things I deeply love – weird fantasy worlds, crude drawings of strange little guys, old school crunchy hiphop drum machines and addictive arcade games that go “PLING PLING PLING” as they spit out little coins – with classic roguelike mechanics," says Friedemann. They also warn that this is a solo project, and as such "doesn’t offer 80+ hours of content like games developed by bigger teams."</p>
<p>As delighted by both the crunchy drum machines and chucklesome weirdos as I am, I do despair a bit that anyone feels the need to avert potential gamer rage by clarifying that their project doesn't last as long as a CRPG. This isn't a slight on the developer, of course. Going by a sample of one (me), literally everyone who has ever played a videogame before is a massive idiot, and you can't be too careful. Can't wait for the enraged Steam review at exactly 79 hours of playtime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gamings-only-three-genres-have-inevitably-converged-into-grimdark-balatro-with-a-whimsical-egg-idiot]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> has passed 5m copies sold, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has soared past 10m downloads, FromSoftware has announced.
</p>
<p>This duo of big milestones was announced on the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175">Elden Ring X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, alongside a lovely piece of custom art featuring the two games. The post reads: "The flame of thy passion burns ever bright in these shadowed lands. To all who wander the Lands Between, we offer our deepest thanks."</p>
<p>It was only in early June that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware celebrated Nightreign passing 3.5 million players</a> for its Soulslike PvE twist on the battle royale genre. Since its release, Nightreign has seen a consistant stream of updates and fixes. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">the addition of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, even harder variations of the game's end-of-run bosses.

<p>Smaller patches have made notable improvements to the game's rough edges too. A tweak to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-maintenance-makes-matchmaking-less-of-a-headache">how remembrances work removed the barriers they presented</a> with matchmaking online. In addition, soon after Nightreign's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">solo runs were made easier in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>The stage is now set for FromSoftware's future projects. Namely, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive: The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-duskbloods">Duskbloods</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">Revealed during the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, it's a multiplayer PvPvE game that's another drastic shift away from the company's usual formula. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods">another unnanounced project we don't know too much about, but is reportedly deep in development</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may finally be on its way to gamers. The <span>South Korean rating board, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank">GRAC</a>&nbsp;(Game Rating and Administration Committee), has just rated the game</span>, hinting at a relatively close release date.</p>



<p>The GRAC has often 'leaked' release date announcements. For example, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its rating on February 6, and the game's launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> around one month later, on March 9. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was then released on June 26.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4's launch date could therefore be announced in the coming weeks, whether at a Nintendo Direct, Gamescom, or even the Tokyo Game Show, for a late 2025 launch. Of course, an early 2026 date is also entirely possible.</p>



<p>Either way, this listing seemingly contradicts a rumor pushed a few hours ago by Reece 'KiwiTalks' Reilly, who <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1947809648700002346#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> there was no official release date because the game still wasn't finished. That seems highly unlikely given that the GRAC already put out its rating.</p>



<p>By the way, the game was rated '12 years old and up' by the South Korean rating board:</p>



<p><em>A first-person adventure game set on the planet Buros, where Samus Aran was transferred after an unexpected situation arose following her encounter with Silux at a Galactic Federation research facility.</em></p>



<p><em>Mild violence (using weapons attached to the suit to attack alien lifeforms).</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's development was very troublesome. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the original Nintendo Switch in June 2017. Back then, it had been assigned to an external studio, Bandai Namco, but their work did not satisfy Nintendo. The Japanese company decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot the project</a> and hand it back to the historic Metroid Prime caretaker: Retro Studios.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, the finishing line appears to be in sight. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to play the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event and came away rather positive about it:</p>



<p><em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also be available for the original Switch, by the way, as per the original announcement.</p>
