		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO, the latest entry in the popular sim-racing series, has debuted on Steam Early Access today, starting the long journey through to a full 1.0 launch, expected later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Early Access is priced at €39.99 | $39.99 | £32.99 with an additional launch discount of 20% off for a limited time.</p>
<p>This is a more direct sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-console-review/">Assetto Corsa</a>, as opposed to the motorsports focused <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/01/assetto-corsa-competizione-ps5-xbox-series-xs-review/">Assetto Corsa Competizione</a>. As such, there’s cars that include everything from modern road cars to classics, hypercars, and race cars.</p>
<p>For the start of early access, Assetto Corsa EVO has 5 tracks and 20 cars, alongside free practice, quick race, driving academy and special event modes.&nbsp;This will grow to include 100 cars and 15 licensed circuits for the 1.0 launch in Fall 2025, with 5 more tracks to follow after launch as free updates.</p>

<p>For now, though, the tracks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands Hatch</li>
<li>Imola</li>
<li>Laguna Seca</li>
<li>Mount Panorama</li>
<li>Suzuka</li>
</ul>
<p>And cars include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abarth 695 Biposto</li>
<li>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAm</li>
<li>Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica Veloce</li>
<li>Alpine A110 S</li>
<li>Alpine A290B Concept</li>
<li>Audi RS 3 Sportback</li>
<li>BMW M2 CS Racing</li>
<li>BMW M4 CSL</li>
<li>Chevrolet Camaro ZL1</li>
<li>Ferrari 296 GTB</li>
<li>Ferrari 488 Challenge EVO</li>
<li>Ford Escort RS Cosworth</li>
<li>Honda S2000</li>
<li>Hyundai i30 N Hatchback</li>
<li>Lotus Emira</li>
<li>Mazda MX5 ND Cup</li>
<li>Mercedes-Benz AMG GT2</li>
<li>Porsche 911 (992) GT3 Cup</li>
<li>Toyota GR86</li>
<li>Volkswagen Golf Mk 8 GTI Clubsport</li>
</ul>
<p>The first content update has already been laid out to add Circuit of Americas, five more cars, custom race weekends, and more. Five more updates are planned through the year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this is following the path laid out by Gran Turismo and other always-online racing games. There’s early reports that server issues are blocking players from accessing the in-game licensing events, and thus blocking them from unlocking more than an initial five cars. Great.</p>
<p>Hopefully they can address the server troubles, and I’m sure many will be hoping they reconsider this kind of digital locking system, because the rest of what AC EVO promises is incredibly promising. There’s a new proprietary race engine that is designed specifically for racing games. It features a full 24-hour race cycle, dynamic weather and track conditions, full support for VR and triple-screen set-ups and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-our-unanswered-questions-about-the-nintendo-switch-2.1084374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">has finally revealed its new console</a>, debuting the Switch 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/itpcsQQvgAQ?si=VDfmRNPpVOUhOhZo">with a short video</a> that went heavy on visuals but light on information. The video was paired with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116009204/en/">a brief follow-up press release from Nintendo</a> that <em>also</em> didn’t go into much detail, with the company ostensibly saving all the juicy stuff for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">the Switch 2 Direct set to take place on April 2nd</a>. While we wait for official word, here are the burning questions we still have about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p></div><p><h4>What are the Switch 2’s specs?</h4></p><p>Perhaps the most glaring omission in the Switch 2 reveal was the fact that Nintendo didn’t say anything about how powerful the new console is. We can see that the console is bigger, but what’s the screen size? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Is it OLED</a> or LCD? Is the screen resolution still 720p? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled">Is 4K resolution supported</a>? </p><p>Though visible for a few brief moments, the reveal video showed off the Switch 2’s new dock. What’s the docked resolution? Is it just a charging shell, or is it still required for TV play? Can you dock the Switch 2 in the original Switch dock, or will it support all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349885/genki-covert-dock-review-price-portable-nintendo-switch-usbc-hdmi-adapter">super-portable third-party docks</a>? </p><p>The Switch 2 also features a second USB-C port at the top. It’s likely there to offer a way to connect USB-C headphones without sacrificing a charging port. But perhaps it might have some other mysterious function. Has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update">native Bluetooth support</a> been improved? It’d be nice to connect more than two wireless controllers if a Bluetooth headset is being used. What about the UI? Can we expect to see a homescreen similar to the original Switch? What about the UI for the eShop? Can <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057">you still post screenshots and clips directly to Facebook</a>? Will Nintendo add the ability to post to other social media or streaming platforms? </p><p><h4>How exactly do the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers work?</h4></p><p>A lot of the reveal trailer focused on the new Joy-Cons, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">while there’s some info we can infer</a>, there’s still more we don’t know. Do they attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">via magnets</a>? Do they still have 3D rumble? Will the Switch 2 support the original Switch Pro controller or the original Switch Joy-Cons in wireless mode? </p><p>Prior to the reveal, there were rumors that the Joy-Cons would have magnetic Hall effect joysticks that would supposedly combat Joy-Con drift. So, what improvements has Nintendo made to protect against drift? Will Nintendo still offer repairs for the new Joy-Cons if they do drift? Will it sell new Joy-Cons separately at launch, and do they come in any new colors? </p><p><h4>What does that new button do?</h4></p><p>There’s a new button on the Switch 2 directly below the home button on the right Joy-Con. Does it have something to do with a new chat functionality <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-purpose-function-campus-chat-rooms-rumor/">like rumors have suggested</a>? </p><div><figcaption><em>Sure seems like that’s some mouse action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Nintendo / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h4>Does the new Joy-Con work like a mouse?</h4></p><p>The reveal video featured a Joy-Con attaching to a cover and zooming around on a surface like a mouse. Is “mouse” functionality one of the Switch 2’s new gimmicks? Speaking of gimmicks, is there still an IR camera for games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14262624/1-2-switch-nintendo-hands-on-preview"><em>1-2-Switch</em></a>? I also hope that the Switch 2 will still support original Switch peripherals like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>Ring-Con</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p><h4>What games will be playable on the Switch 2?</h4></p><p>The Switch 2 reveal only showed off one game: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Beyond that, we have no idea what kind of launch titles to expect or if the new <em>Mario Kart</em> will even be among them. So, what kind of games can we expect for the Switch 2? Will there be Switch 2 exclusives at launch, or will we get cross-gen launch games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em>? One of the bigger original Switch complaints was that newer, larger games often didn’t run or look all that good. Can the console run more technically intensive games? If so, will they run natively on the console, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293458/nintendo-switch-japan-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-odyssey">will they be playable via cloud streaming</a> like <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> and <em>Control</em>? </p><p>Speaking of<em> Mario Kart</em>, the short glimpse we saw of it in the trailer featured what looked to be 15 simultaneous racers with 24 spots behind the starting line. Does this mean the Switch 2 will feature enhanced multiplayer capabilities like larger player lobbies, and will the console natively support communication with them? What of Amiibos? Will the Switch 2 still support those, or are there plans to make more?</p><p><h4>What Switch 2 games will be backward-compatible?</h4></p><p>In today’s video, Nintendo reaffirmed that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">Switch 2 would be backward-compatible</a>, playing both physical and digital original Switch games but with the important caveat that not <em>all</em> games would be supported. What original Switch games won’t be compatible? Will the original Switch games that do work on the console receive some kind of graphical or performance boost like certain games on PlayStation and Xbox?</p><p><h4>How much does the Switch 2 cost?</h4></p><p>There’s also the question of how much the Switch 2 will cost. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The original Switch</a> retailed at $299.99 in 2017. Since then, the cost of everything has gone up, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642627/tsmc-chip-price-increase-supply-shortages-apple-qualcomm">especially computer chips</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">The Switch OLED</a>, the only significant console refresh Nintendo offered, was only $50 more than the base model. But without knowing its internal specs, it’s hard to guess what the Switch 2 might cost.</p><p><h4>When will the Switch 2 launch?</h4></p><p>The most important unanswered question we have about the Switch 2 is the simplest: when can we buy it? Nintendo didn’t share much beyond saying that it will launch in 2025. Much like with the original Switch, it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345091/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-schedule">take the Switch 2 on a world tour</a> starting in April. It’s likely that the console’s release date will follow the tour’s conclusion, which looks to be in June. Here’s hoping Nintendo shares that critical information, along with answers to at least some of these questions during its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd.</p><p><h4>How do the cartridges taste?</h4></p><p>Oh, wait, there is one more burning question... what flavors can we expect for the Switch 2 cartridges? I’m hoping for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14778316/nintendo-switch-cartridge-taste-test-dont-lick-it">something better than “insecticide.”</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In many ways its what everyone wanted and hoped for: A new version of the Switch that’s more powerful, sleeker, and supports all the old games. However, is this new console too...safe? Boring? This is what <em>Kotaku’s </em>staff debated shortly after the reveal, and here’s our lightly edited debate straight from Slack.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><hr><p><strong>John Walker:</strong> God I’m SO BORED of the Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Zachary Zwiezen:</strong> Speaking of Switch 2... Is this the first time Nintendo has done the “Slap a 2 on it” thing? How Sony of them.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> Yep.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I think it’s very indicative of a company that’s suddenly got awfully unsure of itself.</p><p><strong> Zack:</strong> Oh exact opposite! </p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Oh no, I think they know exactly what they’re doing. It’s not a “fun” name the way Super Nintendo Switch would be, but it’s the smart play.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong>: They want to avoid a WiiU situation IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> YUP. In many ways lol.</p><figure id="" data-id="756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-recommend-id="image://756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-recommend-id="image://756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>John:</strong> See, I disagree. I get that they’re VERY sure this is a savvy marketing move, and they’re onto a good thing, and on and on and on.</p><p>But 15 years ago, they’d have called this something way better, and made it much weirder. Hence, unsure of themselves. They don’t think the “Nintendo” way of doing something would work.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> But everything was different 15 years ago. The Switch is still an outlier in the console space.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah. 15 years ago Nintendo was still selling a home console <em>and </em>a portable console.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> RIP Iwata</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I also think the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">Switch 2</a></span> will still be weird in some ways we don’t know yet. The mouse stuff is weird! Cool, too</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, doing something “weird” in this case would almost certainly be a failure from a business standpoint. The Wii, while “weird,” was also savvy business-wise, as it didn’t make sense for Nintendo to compete with Sony and MS at their own game.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yes, but it was weird.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> So was the virtual boy.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Nintendo just announced an iteration of their current console and put a “2" on the name. That’s REALLY unlike them. It’s weird because it’s what everyone else does.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yes, but there is not an opportunity today for them to do something that is both “weird” and that would be that successful IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, I bet if you asked Nintendo designers they wouldn’t call any of that stuff weird. Just new ideas they were trying</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> The SNES wasn’t weird. it was basically the equivalent for the time of the Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Gameboy Color was basically just Gameboy but color. Nintendo isn’t above iteration.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> No one expected a Wii, and at the time everyone said it was a mistake because it was so technologically weak. </p><p>When the Switch was announced, there was SO much discourse about how it couldn’t compete with the other consoles because it was so weak. </p><p>I think if Nintendo had done something totally new and weird and original, they could have still had a huge amount of success. And sure, make the Switch XL at the same time.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Like what? What’s your amazing “weird” idea that could have done gangbusters today for Nintendo?</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> And not break compatibility with hundreds of games.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> That’s the point! Only Nintendo could come up with it!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> [indifferent face emoji]</p><p> Yeah I mean, times change. I just don’t see that opportunity today. Maybe it will arise again in the future, but right now, this was the play.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I think you’d have said the same post N64, post GC, etc. And post Wii!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I would not.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Clearly the Wii U was NOT the move, but I love that it WAS the move.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, post N64 maybe, Nintendo didn’t really get “weird” with consoles until the Wii.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Here were my two AMAZING suggestions in my Switch 2 Disappointed piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship Mario game uses our house furniture for platforms.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I hate it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Right, that sounds like shit.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Ask Apple how well AR is doing.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> There is no way that would have a high adoption rate. No way.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> THEY AREN’T REAL PITCHES!</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Well my reaction was very real. lol.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I know but like, you’re just presuming that Nintendo can, under any and all marketplace circumstances, generate ideas for consoles that would be both groundbreaking and hugely successful. I don’t see a basis for that at all.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, after the last decade of merging all their software development into ONE platform instead of two distinct divisions (portable/home) the Switch 2 was always going to be the play. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> If you said to me after the GameCube, “Come on then, think of something,” I wouldn’t have replied, “Um, a thing with a sensor bar and two sticks you wave around.” And if I had, you’d have said “hate it.”</p><p><strong>John: </strong>“Oh you mean like the Kinect? Yeah, GREAT idea.”</p><figure id="" data-id="1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-recommend-id="image://1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-recommend-id="image://1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Zack:</strong> The thing is Nintendo still does weird shit in the Switch era. Its just stuff you buy <em>for </em>the Switch. Like Labo. Which is a better way to do it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yeah. </p><p><strong>John: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307">Everyone should read my brilliant article.</a></span></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I still hold out hope that the Switch 2 will have some surprises. That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah, that’s my point!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bring me that horizon.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Yakuza series has no shortage of weird and wonderful games. From the serious but goofy at times mainline entries to its plethora of historical spinoffs, prequels, and side stories. There’s something for everyone here, really. Whether you’re looking for the next installment in the long running Like a Dragon series, or just want to play something a little different, our last hands-on with Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii ahead of release suggests that it’s shaping up to be another solid spin-off that will plunder dozens of hours from you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag dropped way back in 2013, I’ve been itching for another worthy pirate adventure. While there have been a few decent attempts released since then, none of them managed to capture my attention and made me excited to get to pirating until I got the chance to play Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. At first glance, Pirates and Yakuza may seem like a combination that’s about as compatible as oil and water. But upon closer inspection, Like a Dragon’s world, eccentric main character, and not too overly serious presentation makes for a surprisingly competent and fun pirate adventure. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Combat Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii you assume the role of longtime series favorite Goro Majima after he loses his memory and winds up on an Hawaiian island. From everything I saw during my few hours of hands-on time, the series’ weirdness is cranked up to 11 here. Outside of beating up roving gangs of pirates and the occasional bounty with my small tiger companion, I found myself recruiting a wide assortment of weirdos to my pirate crew, playing a plethora of fun and surprisingly addicting minigames – such as a home run derby, karaoke, and sailing the pacific ocean in my pirate ship, complete with ship-to-ship combat and aggressive weather. To put it bluntly, there’s a lot to do here. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Island Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During my preview I spent a lot of time in the pirate city of Madlantis, an area overrun by pirates, criminals, and some genuinely strange people even by Yakuza’s standards. I was able to participate in numerous minigames and side activities such as claw games, ports of classic SEGA arcade games like Virtua Fighter, and the Pirates’ Coliseum, an area where I was able to engage in ship-to-ship combat to battle it out with an assortment of unique pirate crews, as well as other combat-based minigames. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of combat, in main gameplay, it strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style. Majima has two fighting styles: Mad Dog and Sea Dog. While both fighting styles are rooted in the standard “heavy and light attack mixed in with dodges” formula, both styles play differently enough that I found myself swapping between them in order to keep the momentum on my side and deal out as much damage as possible. In Mad Dog mode, Majima will don his familiar getup and use a plethora of fast combos to quickly dispatch an enemy. Sea Dog, on the other hand, has Majima wearing a pirate getup and relies on pirate-themed weaponry such as two cutlass swords, a pistol, and a grappling hook. While Mad Dog was fun to play, the majority of my combat time was spent in Sea Dog due to its diverse assortment of weapons and abilities. Regardless of what fighting style I had selected, though I found myself having a ton of fun beating up dozens of rival pirates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say combat didn’t have its shortcomings, though. Blocking and dodging took a bit of practice to get used to, and the enemies can range from a total pushover to a challenge that had me seeing the game over screen more times than I had expected to in a Yakuza game. Still, once I figured out how to effectively switch between fighting styles and take advantage of every tool and ability I had available, the combat became a challenging but rewarding experience. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Sail</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naval combat is a welcome addition to the Like a Dragon universe. While some games tend to over complicate ship combat, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii goes with a “less is more” approach to its maritime warfare sections. My ship had a few methods of destroying enemy vessels the port side of my pirate ship was donned with short-range flamethrowers that could deal immense damage as long as I was close to my target, while the starboard side of my ship was equipped with long-range cannons. Firing off these two options in addition to the front-facing machine guns is how I spent most of my time in ship-to-ship combat. The third option was to leave the helm of my ship and use Majima’s rocket launcher. While this didn’t do as much damage as the other options, it was pretty fun to jump around my boat and take pot shots at enemy ships. Regardless of which method I chose to engage in, I found myself having fun drifting my boat around and sinking enemy vessels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on everything I’ve played so far, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is definitely shaping up to not only live up to the high standards of the Like a Dragon series, but it also has the potential to become one of the better pirate games released since Black Flag. With its fun and creative combat, intuitive ship warfare, and genuinely interesting and wacky world, you’re going to want to pack your Hawaiian shirt.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even better if you're a fan of Sonic: Ever since the Switch arrived in 2017, Sega has worked like clockwork to consistently release Sonic games for the hybrid console. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> out on Switch alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> in theaters, it's safe to say Sega's speedster is bigger than ever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Switch 2 has been officially announced</a>, it's pretty much guaranteed more Sonic games are on the way. Thankfully, the Switch 2 trailer confirms the system's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible">backwards compatibility</a>, so your existing Sonic games aren't going anywhere. For anyone looking to check out the modern era of Sonic (and friends), here are all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-sonic-games">Sonic the Hedgehog games</a> you can play right now as well as upcoming Sonic games we expect to see on the Switch 2. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Sonic Games Are There on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A total of <strong>nine Sonic games have been released for Nintendo Switch</strong>. This spans the first year of the system back in 2017 to the most recent game, Sonic x Shadows, released in October 2024. Keep in mind that this list below does not include the games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><div catalogid="6381d2be-7f83-4285-91f2-acb37fdd2982" id="213268"><div id="213268" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Sonic Game Released on the Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Mania (2017)</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/thumbs/userUploaded/2017/8/14/sonicmania1280-1502683395450.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sonic Games: Sonic Mania</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review">Sonic Mania</a> was developed by PagodaWest Games and Sonic fangame community member Christian Whitehead as a love letter to the classic Sonic the Hedgehog titles released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD platforms. Taking place after the events of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, the game remixes eight iconic levels, including Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant Zone, and introduces five new ones, including the glamorous Studiopolis Zone and the peaceful Press Garden Zone. This game also introduces a new troupe of Eggbots called the Hard-Boiled Heavies for Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to beat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mania is considered one of the best Sonic games of the 2010s because of the experiment in allowing a group of Sonic fans to create a game other Sonic fans would love, the vivid neon graphics, and the new challenges present in every stage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Forces (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/11/sonic-forces-review">Sonic Forces</a> makes Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic form a resistance against Dr. Eggman after he conquered most of the world alongside Infinite, a masked jackal who uses the Phantom Ruby to create doppelgangers and warp reality. The game switches gameplay modes between third-person Boost gameplay with Modern Sonic, side-scrolling gameplay with Classic Sonic, and a mode with the custom avatar character, which can be any animal you want, whose weapons use Wisp power-ups. Forces’ writing and lighting aren’t exactly the best in the series, but the game is still tolerable for some people.</p><div id="197171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Forces</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Sonic Racing (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review">Team Sonic Racing</a> takes racing games to a whole new level by having players race <em>with</em> each other, not <em>against</em> each other. This game has a cooperative gameplay mechanic similar to Splatoon and Overwatch, using Sonic Heroes as a frame of reference, where you play in teams of three characters and work together to win each race, paying very close attention to your teammates’ performance and sharing Wisp power-ups with them to allow them to speed up and pull your ranks. Since most of the karts are sports cars, you can customize them with gold rims and paint your car any color you want West Coast Customs style.</p><div id="181380" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2 Games Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Released a year before the real-life Tokyo Olympic Games was scheduled to begin (only to be postponed to 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/05/mario-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-review">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> brings the platform rivalry between the jolly red plumber, the speedy blue hedgehog, and their respective friends back to the world stage with new events, like surfing, skateboarding, karate, and sport climbing, and bonus features. The game includes a story mode that takes Mario and Sonic back to the Tokyo 1964 Olympics and their early 2D sprite selves, while everyone else works to help bring them back to the real world in the present day. You get the best of both eras and some history lessons about the Olympic Games in Tokyo to go with it.</p><div id="195359" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario &amp; Sonic at The Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Colors: Ultimate (2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-colors-ultimate-review">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is a remastered version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-colors">original Sonic Colors</a> developed by Blind Squirrel Games for Sonic’s 30th anniversary in 2021. The remaster enhanced the graphics to brighten up the colors of Eggman’s interplanetary amusement park and the character models, introduced a new Jade Ghost Wisp to help Sonic phase through walls and ceilings, replaced the traditional lives with rescues from Tails, and introduced mini races against Metal Sonic. You can also collect Park Tokens to customize Sonic with the wackiest designs for his shoes and gloves.</p><div id="197172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Colors Ultimate</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Origins (2022)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-origins">Sonic Origins</a> compiles the first four classic Sonic games released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD and remasters them for modern consoles and the audience that plays on them, whether they’re veteran fans seeking a nostalgia fix or young fans who want to understand Sonic’s history. Players can experience the game in Classic Mode, which is the original format presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, or Anniversary Mode, which replaces lives with coins and allows Sonic to use Drop Dash as he did in Sonic Mania. Each game in the compilation features new animated cutscenes at the beginning and end done by the incomparable Tyson Heese to connect all four games into a cohesive story, provided you play them in the original release order.</p><div id="187208" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Origins Plus</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Frontiers (2022)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">Sonic Frontiers</a> is the first open-world game in the Sonic franchise – or should we say, “open-zone”? – born out of a trend of open-world games being styled after The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Sonic explores the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-frontiers/maps">vast Starfall Islands</a> to fight cybernetic enemies, solve various puzzles, and run through Cyber Space levels modeled after the levels from past Sonic titles in an effort to save his friends from the digitized dimension.

With Classic Sonic being a CGI character on his own for the first time and classic levels getting revamped with new music and upgraded level designs, the game allows up to four people to locally play together as Sonic and his friends throughout 11 levels across the Northstar Islands and grants new powers for every Chaos Emerald they collect to overcome obstacles. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic X Shadow Generations (2024)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Sonic's latest is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, a remastered version of 2011's Sonic Generation that goes beyond graphical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements by including an all-new campaign comprised of reminagined Shadow stages from past Sonic games.

However, that reveal trailer feels so much more full of life (thanks to actual people being present) and creativity than what we experienced today. The Switch introduction video begins with a man playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on his TV screen, before quickly snapping to the Switch logo and to show how he can take the system on the go. The hook of the system is showcased up front as the guy brings the Switch with him to take his dog to a park in the early morning. While unconfirmed, if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> works or even has better visuals on Switch 2, maybe showing that anticipated game on Switch 2 could have provided a similar sense of awe or at least an idea of the system's technical prowess.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, Nintendo presents all of the various ways the Switch can be utilized, whether on an airplane or even during a rooftop party. This reveal trailer also sees actual people interacting with and using the system--something that isn't present at all with the Switch 2 first look. Nintendo also sprinkles in a handful of third-party games with the original Switch, giving a better idea at what's on the way for the system. For instance, this was when we learned that Skyrim would come to the console. Now, for context, third-party support had absolutely cratered on Wii U, so the company needed to convey that partners were on board with Switch. However, it would have been nice for Nintendo to give third parties the option to tease their games with Switch 2 instead of only vague Mario Kart footage. Showing that Fortnite will, in fact, work on Switch 2 seems like a no-brainer and easy win.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1938400712" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

last third of Switch's unveiling is where Nintendo really flexes its muscles compared to what we see with Switch 2. The Switch unveiling not only shares gameplay footage of what ends up being Super Mario Odyssey, but also offers up a teaser for Splatoon 2 (though people were unsure it was a full sequel at the time). Once again, with Switch 2, Nintendo presents a pretty uninspired glimpse at a new Mario Kart--presumably Mario Kart 9. Of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-nintendo-best-selling-game-of-all-time/1100-6523297/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is basically Nintendo's best-selling game ever</a>, so if Switch 2 launches with a new entry, it will do gangbusters. But the presentation behind this could have been injected with at least a little bit of fun or at the very least highlight how this new Mario Kart will be unique. (Eagle-eyed fans believe 24 racers can compete at one time, and Donkey Kong seems redesigned to more closely resemble his appearance in the New Super Mario Bros. Movie.)</p><p dir="ltr">The most intriguing part of the Switch 2 unveiling relates to what appears to be optical sensors in each new Joy-Con. Nintendo then has a small segment where the controllers seem like they're ice-skating across a surface, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+mouse+controls+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">possibly hinting that Switch 2 will feature mouse-like controls</a>. If true, why not shout out to everyone that there is new functionality behind the Joy-Cons for Switch 2? Why only point out the magnetic aspect? To me, showing mouse-like controls on Switch 2 with something like a new Mario Paint, Mario Maker, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, or even an old game like Minecraft would have added a bit more wonder and excitement to this reveal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to wave away complaints and claim Nintendo will sell boatloads of Switch 2 systems regardless. But first impressions matter. Has Nintendo given up on expanding the video game user base? Because this video implies that to me. Nothing about Switch 2 looks revolutionary or particularly refreshing. Instead, this is more of the same. Maybe that's all that's needed: not rocking the boat on a system that people already love.</p><p dir="ltr">But Nintendo, historically, has struggled when the company gets conservative and complacent. So far, Switch 2 seems way too safe. That said, with a Switch 2 Direct coming on April 2, there is plenty of time to build up the hype train.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p>I would have been disappointed if Nintendo messed with what worked for the Switch with the Switch 2. I’m glad it has a bigger screen, one that appears to be even larger than the seven-inch display on the OLED Switch. I’m guessing the taller Joy-Cons will be easier to hold, which could be a massive improvement for my hands, and attaching them from the side looks like it could be easier than sliding them up and down. The second USB-C port on the top will be a <em>very</em> welcome addition for easier charging. And even though I barely used it, the return of the kickstand is great, too — maybe with the Switch 2, I’ll actually bring it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13403924/nintendo-switch-karen-meme-reveal-video">some rooftop parties</a>.</p><p>I also quite like the new black design with accent colors. Sure, it doesn’t pop quite as much as the red and blue Joy-Cons for the original Switch, but I think this design looks elegant with a splash of Nintendo whimsy — I love how colors peek out in different places around the hardware. And there will almost certainly be more color options at launch; Nintendo initially revealed the Switch <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161020005938/en/Nintendo-Switch-World-Premiere-Demonstrates-New-Entertainment-Experiences-from-a-Home-Gaming-System">in gray</a> and later showed off the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2017/170113.html">now-iconic red and blue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo made a great call in making physical <em>and</em> digital Switch games backward-compatible with the Switch 2. (Before today, it was a little unclear if that would be the case.) I’ve spent years building up a large digital Switch library that is filled with incredible games, and while Nintendo says that “certain” games won’t be supported on its new console, I imagine that the vast majority of my favorite Switch games will be playable.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nintendo didn’t reveal any technical specs, we can presume it’s going to be more powerful than the original Switch. And hopefully the new console gives a boost to games that sometimes struggled on the original hardware — as much as I love <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, some performance improvements could make it even better. The same goes for other big games like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Maybe we’ll finally get a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game on the Switch now.</p><p>Yes, there’s a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2. The only official Switch 2 game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Nintendo didn’t reveal the console’s UI or say if the console has any improved online features. The video briefly showed a way to use the Joy-Con like a computer mouse, but that could be a barely used gimmick. We don’t know how much it will cost or when in 2025 it will come out.</p><p>That said, because it builds upon the original Switch’s outstanding legacy, it will be a familiar experience. There will be lots of older games to play even if Nintendo doesn’t have many Switch 2 games from the jump. It doesn’t look like Nintendo has switched things up very much — and that’s fine with me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommendshere">Patrick Recommends...<em>Here</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The de-aging stuff in this movie is so bad, and yet...</span></figcaption></figure><p>My wife is not into sad movies. She'll tolerate them, but her bar is usually "is this going to be up for an Oscar?" Beyond that, I'm on my own to swirl around a glass of bourbon and weep as midnight approaches. But I like good cry; <a href="https://medium.com/@patrick.klepek/everything-is-normal-until-it-isnt-111c6959ae7d?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">as I've argued in the past</a>, it's a reminder of raw emotions that have become distant—tolerable, even—with time. <em>Here</em>, the latest from director Robert Zemeckis, has a lot going against it. Zemeckis is broadly a hack these days, enamored with technology over storytelling. (If you've never seen <em>The Polar Express</em> and its terrifying CGI, bless.) </p><p><em>Here</em>, an adaptation of a graphic novel where the camera sits at a fixed point and has us watching a family (and a place) evolve over time, has all the trappings of modern Zemeckis' worst impulses. For the most part, the movie has us watching Tom Hanks and Robin Wright look slightly off. Just use make up, man, or let me imagine what a 16-year-old Tom Hanks looks like. It's fine. Here, it's grotesque. </p><p>But...<em>Here </em>knocked me off my rocker. I'm turning 40 next month, so I'm in a moment where I'm spending time thinking about what's come before, what's coming next. And icky visuals aside, <em>Here</em> lands enough sappy, sentimental punches about what it means to live a life, what it means to have regrets, what it means to imagine a life difference than the one you've experienced. I watched this while on holiday break, where my kids were around me all the time. It got me bad.</p><p>(The less we talk about the movie trying to comment on what it's like to be Black, however, the better. What the hell, Zemeckis?)</p><p>If you, like me, are a sap and enjoy working through a box of issues, check it out.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends%E2%80%A6-30-for-30-lance">Rob Recommends… <em>30 for 30: Lance</em></h2><figure></figure><p>Slowly but surely competitive cycling is moving up the rankings of my favorite sports. But as much as I watch, I always feel like there are tremendous amounts of context I am missing. I don’t fully understand the sport yet, and I always feel like I have just the smallest sense of its history.</p><p>So I decided to watch the documentary ESPN did on Lance Armstrong, who might be the Antichrist of the Tour de France and maybe all of modern cycling. It’s an utterly riveting film, in part because it turns out to be such a stark portrait of an unrepentantly corrupt and self-centered man. That might be the film’s great weakness as well: it’s so focused on Lance that it somehow fails to do justice to the extent of his cheating or the viciousness with which he defended his undeserved reputation. It becomes a psyschodrama about what was going on in the head of an audacious crime boss, and can’t quite stay on top of all the misdeeds or victims he left along the way.</p><p>On the other hand, Armstrong <em>is </em>an incredible figure. He appears to have stumbled into cycling because it was the one sport at which he truly excelled, and it fed his deep desire to dominate and humiliate people via competition. At no point does Armstrong or anyone else talk about his love for cycling, because it’s not clear he even liked it that much. He was from a young age a damaged and cruel person, he excelled at a sport where corruption and cheating were prerequisites for serious high-level competition, and then he improbably survived a metastatic cancer and this miserable person overnight became the inspiring feel-good sports figure of the decade.</p><p>At the outset we’re warned by a lot of the people interviewed as part of the documentary that Lance is a master manipulator, and they think he’ll turn any “tell-all” documentary about himself into an exercise in image rehabilitation. So take what I’m about to say with a grain of salt but I did come away feeling some sympathy for him in this one particular way: he was a corrupt liar, but he was the hero of a corrupt and mendacious age.</p><p>It seems like nobody who knew cycling was every fooled: everyone knew PEDs were widespread in the sport, and while Armstrong was marketing himself as a clean cyclist in a sport that was cleaning up its act, the riders were <em>improving</em> against the times they’d set in years when people had been caught taking drugs. But it was a good story that made a niche sport more popular, that gave American media a clean-cut underdog hero at a time when the United States was losing a pair of increasingly unpopular imperial wars, and that made a lot of brands and businesses a lot of money. Armstrong is justly reviled as a vicious and vindictive cheater, but the documentary raises questions about how much of the fraud he perpetrated on his own. He had lots of partners who were invested in selling his phony heroism, and when he was finally cornered, a lot of those same interested parties helped turn him into a symbol of everything that was rotten in sports.</p><p>You watch this documentary and you see clips of Matt Lauer talking about Armstrong on Today, or you hear about an FDA bureaucrat deciding to make it a mission to expose what Armstrong was up to, or you hear about how his commercial empire collapsed when Nike finally cut ties with him. In victory and disgrace, Armstrong seems to have been the perfect symbol for the comforting fictions Americans are so often fed. First, that a rich and ruthless competitor can have a clean conscience and a heart of gold, and then that in the end the truth will out and justice will be served.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-nobody-understands-playing-cards">Cado Recommends... <em>Nobody Understands Playing Cards</em></h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kY6DmPs4klU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Nobody understands playing cards — not even the experts"></iframe></figure><p>Yeah yeah, I know, it's funny how predictable this is. Sometimes you have to live your truth though and my truth is that I love card games, so I was delighted when last weekend <em>Polygon</em> published this fun video on some of the things that make cards so compelling. Simone de Rochefort et al have done their research on how 52 pieces of thick paper can have such a lasting impact on culture, and take some time to get into some of the math around the probabilities that make a deck of cards such a great source of delicious randomized tension.</p>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> the Nintendo Switch 2 console on Thursday with it releasing some time in 2025. The reveal came in the form of a two-minute video that showed the new system from a number of angles. Players got a look at the handheld, the new Joy-Cons, and even the new dock.</p>



<p>While full specs weren’t announced—that’s likely coming during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct event</a> on April 2—Nintendo didn’t really hide any aspect of the exterior of the system. From the kickstand to the dock to the new USB-C port on top, there’s a lot to see. So, let’s check out the first pictures of the new Nintendo Switch (click on an image to enlarge it).</p>

<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-console-pictures">Nintendo Switch 2 Console Pictures</h2>



<p>As you can see in the pictures below, a number of rumored features were confirmed. The new Joy-Cons attach to the console via a magnet as opposed to a slide rail while the new dock is more rounded, much like the system itself. Sticking with the Joy-Cons, the base colors now match the system with the red and blue being accents on the connector and under the thumbstick. The new button that has been shown on past mockups is on the right controller, though Nintendo seems to have intentionally left it blank to hide its functionality.</p>



<p>Elsewhere there is the aforementioned second USB-C port on the top of the system. Lastly, the console’s kickstand also received an overhaul as it appears to allow the Switch 2 to lay nearly completely horizontal with support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/killer-strategy-boardgame-roots-steam-expansion-has-made-me-aware-that-root-exists-as-a-pc-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I have an on-and-off-again relationship with boardgaming based mostly on the fact that I have nobody to play boardgames with. I used to be part of a boardgaming circle, but then I missed a fateful opening round of Twilight Imperium, and then the pandemic started, and then everybody lost patience with Tabletop Game Simulator. 
</p>
<p>
As such, I've been unwilling to invest in new boardgames, and unable to play one particular awesome-sounding creation, Root, an asymmetrical strategy affair in which different factions of animals vie for control (mostly) of a storybook forest. Good news, me: I've just learned that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/">Dire Wolf adapted it into a PC game a whole four years ago</a>. I know this because somebody's just sent me a mail about a new Marauder expansion on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Root, as I understand it, is excellent because the factions are effectively playing different games side by side. You've got the birds, who used to rule the woods and must keep up a steady momentum of territory capture or else fall into squabbling. You've got the cats, who are currently in charge, have the biggest army, and are trying to chop it all down for profit. You've got a guerrilla alliance of other critters, who don't have a base to begin with and must build sympathy in the shadows. And you've got the Vagabond, a travelling ragamuffin who plays all sides while undertaking a quest for fame and plunder.
</p>
<p>
That's the base offering. The Steam edition has received a bunch of expansions. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/965580/view/536590767160820525?l=english">The latest one</a> introduces two more factions: Lord of the Hundreds, who will "oppress the Woodland and burn it to the ground if need be", and the Keepers in Iron, a group of exiled knights searching for relics.
</p><p>
The digital adaptation's 3D visuals and presentation feel a teeny bit lacklustre next to the woodcut storybook vibes of the original boardgame - this feels like a case of more is less. Still, I am very keen to play. Perhaps it'll fill the hole left in my life by the collapse of my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a> habit. The predictable question I have, as a filthy hermit, is whether the bot AI is any shop. If it's cobblers, I may have no choice but to visit my old boardgaming group, cap in hand, and beg for another chance. I think they're done playing Twilight Imperium now? It's been years, but this is Twilight Imperium.

Now it’s delving into piracy with <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>. I recently got to spend two hours with the game, due out next month, and, I came away expecting Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to once again nail new ideas while maintaining the series’ old familiar draws.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,195896" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Pirate Yakuza </em>puts the focus entirely on fan-favorite comic relief rival Goro Majima for the first time in the series’ 20-year history. Majima has been a supporting character and playable hero a few times over the years, but <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is the first time he’s been the lone star of the show. He’s a good lead for a game that takes the series in one of its more outlandish directions yet, as he’s often facilitated comic breaks with fervor and gusto. If there’s one character that commits to the bit, it’s him, and that includes becoming a pirate captain in modern-day Hawaii.</p><p><em>Pirate Yakuza</em>’s story takes place six months after the events of <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, and somehow Majima’s lost all memory of his life as a crime boss and club manager. <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>doesn’t use this as a complete break from previous games, as recovering his old memories is a core part of his story, but it does mean that he’s taking on a new crew on the open seas off Hawaii’s shores. Majima is at the center of a conflict between the pirates he works alongside and the yakuza he was once a part of.</p><p>The tension between those two forces means <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is constantly shifting between traditional <em>Yakuza </em>scraps and silliness and, as the name suggests, pirate ship battles. As far as hand-to-hand combat goes, <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>delivers some of the fastest-paced fighting the series has had, to the point that it feels like it borders on a character action game along the lines of <em>Devil May Cry</em>. <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-preview-agent-style-yakuza-rgg-1850759282?rev=1736969234480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-preview-agent-style-yakuza-rgg-1850759282?rev=1736969234480">experimented with spy gadgetry</a></span> to give its combat a distinct feel, and <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is riffing on its own motif by giving Majima a pair of cutlasses. The game feels snappy, stylish, and occasionally pretty tough. Swapping Majima between his harder-hitting pirate persona and the nimble yakuza one can make the difference between getting clobbered and overcoming a gang of criminals. I gravitated toward the knife-wielding yakuza style for one-on-one fights and swapped to the pirate one for wider slashes when taking on big groups. I was surprised by the difficulty of a few fights, such as one against a runaway prisoner I met on the beaches of Hawaii who cold-cocked me as I was still learning all the tricks I had at my disposal. Most of my memories of <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s beat-em-up combat are of it being tedious and repetitive, so coming into <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>and finding something that felt involved and dynamic was a welcome sign.</p><p><em>Pirate Yakuza</em>’s riffs on old <em>Yakuza </em>ideas are where it shines the most. Even though Majima is sailing the seven seas this time, I still found the grounded moments traveling around cities on land to be just as memorable as duking it out on a pirate ship. Between silly mini-games and squaring up against any crook who would approach me, I rode around on a scooter until I stopped at a small cafe where employees were trying to attract customers with a small performance. Even as the series constantly pushes against the boundaries of what people think it is, those small human interactions remain the beating heart of <em>Yakuza</em>.</p><p>The actual pirate ship battles are the part I’m not quite sold on just yet, but I could see them getting more complex beyond the early sections of the game I played. Sailing to different islands on a slow-moving ship with weather hazards felt novel, but I could imagine it getting tedious down the line. Ship battles, meanwhile, feel complex in the menus beforehand, but in practice got rather monotonous as I would position my ship to fire upon incoming vessels, let out some cannonballs, then turn around and do the same thing from the other side. The depth comes from the preparation, which includes assigning crewmates with different specialties to weapon-manning and other tasks to bolster your ship’s effectiveness in battle. Building your ship’s arsenal and managing your crew were the most interesting part of ship battles in my time with the early game, and I’m curious to see just how expansive these options are and if the game can spice these fights up as it goes on.</p><p>Every time I pick up a <em>Yakuza </em>game, I’m always surprised to see just how much RGG can bend what I think these games are without quite breaking them. The series has been characterized as grounded despite constantly escalating to new heights, and what I’ve played of <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>feels like a natural yet goofy extension built off a stable foundation. We’ll see if Majima’s seafaring detour pays off when the game launches on February 21, but even if it doesn’t, I’m more curious than ever about how far RGG is willing to take its heroes as it keeps pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a <em>Yakuza </em>game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo confirmed the existence of the device last year, and it’s been a drip feed of news from leakers ever since. Now that the Switch 2 officially exists and we can put a face and name to the concept of the Switch successor, fans can finally relax after clinging to the company’s socials for all this time.</p><figure id="" data-id="944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-recommend-id="image://944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-format="png" data-width="1231" data-height="219" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A YouTube comment that reads &quot;Never has there been so much 'ok fine, here's an announcement' energy.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A YouTube comment that reads &quot;Never has there been so much 'ok fine, here's an announcement' energy.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-recommend-id="image://944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-format="png" data-width="1231" data-height="219" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A YouTube comment that reads &quot;Never has there been so much 'ok fine, here's an announcement' energy.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h84021"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Mario Kart (9?)</strong></em></h2><p>We still don’t know much about the Nintendo Switch 2, and the only game the company showed for the device was a new <em>Mario Kart</em>. No title was given, but the brief glimpse we saw of the game in action showed a more cartoonish art style than that of <em>MK8 </em>and teased what seems to be a 24-player mode. Fans seem stoked about it, and hot on the subtly revamped character designs.</p><h2 id="h84022"><a id=""></a><strong>Avoiding the Wii U mistake</strong></h2><p>One thing several people have noted is that Nintendo went out of its way to make it clear that the Nintendo Switch 2 is a new console. The Wii U had plenty of problems, but one of the biggest was the mistaken perception, based on its branding, that it could be a peripheral for the original Wii. Slapping a 2 on the name makes it clear that this is the next iteration of the thing you already love. Say what you want about PlayStation’s naming convention not being that flashy, but you know that a PlayStation 5 is the next major console from Sony. The Switch 2 name is straightforward, and that is the best decision Nintendo could have made in moving to the next system.</p><h2 id="h84023"><a id=""></a><strong>Some healthy skepticism and questions</strong></h2><p>The reveal trailer finally removed any uncertainty about the existence of the Switch 2, but it was light on some larger details. Right now, it seems to be mostly a bigger, beefier Switch with a few extra bells and whistles. That’s pretty uncharacteristic of Nintendo, which has typically introduced some major innovation in every generational leap. So there are a lot of unanswered questions still floating around as we move toward launch. Is the bigger screen and more powerful hardware the main hook? Will Nintendo release more Joy-Cons than the sleek ones it shows in the reveal trailer? There’s still a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2.</p><h2 id="h84024"><a id=""></a><strong>The mouse and keyboard girlies are eating</strong></h2><p>There have been rumors that the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons would double as mice. This could be huge for strategy games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008"><em>Civilization 7</em></a></span> that have historically been cumbersome to play with a controller.

                <p>Nintendo historically holds Nintendo Direct briefings in February, and it seems that tradition will continue this year.

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has called out "shitty leakers" in the wake of Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal, stating they "should be cursed".</p>
<p>Earlier today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo finally revealed its Switch 2 console</a> after months of leaks and speculation.</p>
<p>Following the reveal, Kamiya (game designer of Okami, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Devil May Cry and more) took to social media to express his frustration towards those who leaked Switch 2 information ahead of the official reveal.</p>

<p>"I hope that all of the people who leaked Switch 2 information/those who helped leak it will be cursed for the rest of their lives to always have poop on the soles of their shoes when they get home," he began, jokingly enough (via machine translation).</p><p>Kamiya referred back to the surprise reveal of an Okami sequel in development from last year's The Game Awards. "Now that I've enjoyed the surprise announcement of Okami with all the users, I truly believe that... all those damn leakers should be cursed," he said.</p>

</p></div>

<p>He continued, referring to theoretical leakers as "the worst of scum".</p>
<p>"The shitty leaker only acts for his own pleasure and self-satisfaction, not only is he not contributing to anyone's benefit, he is incurring all sorts of opportunity losses, and has done nothing to be proud of in front of others," he said. "He is the worst of scum, so he should be covered in shit from head to toe and thrown out of the atmosphere... and then stop thinking and wander forever."</p>
<p>He concluded the thread with a further vent of frustration.</p>
<p>"These damn leakers are in a position of responsibility where they have access to information that only a very select few know, yet what they do is nothing more than an expression of a filthy desire for approval that lacks a shred of rationality; they are shameful people, so it is not the manufacturers whose secrets have been exposed who should be blamed, but these damn people, and they need to be crushed as soon as possible," he said.</p>
<p>The outspoken Kamiya is known for his hot takes on social media, yet while his thread is lighthearted to begin with, there appears to be an undercurrent of genuine annoyance.</p>
<p>Indeed, leaks have become an issue across the industry. In recent years, many major releases - from Nintendo and other studios - have been leaked ahead of release. This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-very-very-upset-by-switch-2-leaks-former-staff-suggest">former Nintendo staff said the company had likely been "very, very, upset" by Switch 2 leaks</a>, due to their "disruptive impact".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Kamiya's Okami sequel</a>, thankfully, didn't leak before its reveal. It's being developed by his new studio Clovers.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is still without a firm release date, but was finally announced earlier today along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The newly revealed Nintendo Switch 2 console could end up becoming one of the most popular gaming systems of all time, as suppliers are reportedly ready to ship a huge amount of units in the first year of availability.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>, unspecified analysts said that Nintendo suppliers are ready to ship 20 million units in the console's first year of availability, a much bigger number of units compared to the first year of other popular systems like the original Switch, and the PlayStation 5, although production of the current generation system by Sony was impacted for quite some time by shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic. With this many units, at the very least, there shouldn't be too much trouble finding the console in stores, which has apparently been one of<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/"> Nintendo's concerns</a> for a long time.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally officially been revealed today with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/">a trailer</a> that focused on the hardware and the differences with the current system. Besides showing off the system, the trailer also provided a quick look at what will likely be the next entry in the Mario Kart series and confirmed that the new system will have full backward compatibility with the current consoles, as it will run both physical and digital Switch games. A better look at the system will come in April with a dedicated Nintendo Direct, while a select few will be able to get some hands-on time with the Nintendo Switch 2 thanks to special experiences that will be held across the world.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-update-rafts-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Endnight Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>update, and this one comes complete with new buildable structures, support for a major Steam feature, and even a fun new secret to find.</p>

<p>Naturally, this update isn't quite as big as the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">huge 1.0 release in February last year</a>, but it does bring three new buildable raft structures, as well as a new mooring post for you to hitch your seafaring vehicles to.</p>

<p>You'll also find new buildable holders for the KnightV and hang glider vehicles, as well as a "procedural defensive wall placement system" to help you draw a more natural formation for your defensive fences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sons-of-the-forest-update-head.jpg?itok=wQGdiNzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sons-of-the-forest-update-head.jpg?itok=5OAQfPZ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you were using&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s new procedural defensive wall system, this would never have happened.</figcaption></figure><p>Support for Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta" rel="nofollow">Game Recording feature</a>, which allows you to record your game footage without ever leaving the comfort of Steam, has also been added, so you can show off your new defensive walls to all your friends.</p>

<p>What's more, there's also a new "secret player findable outfit" that you can discover somewhere in the game world. Endnight is remaining cagey regarding exactly how or where you find this item, so it's up to you to scour&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s world to claim it.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to tons and tons of new gameplay improvements and bug fixes. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a> for this update if you want to see everything that's new.</p>




<p><em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>is the followup to the supremely spooky survival game&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, which was released back in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4. The sequel is only available for PC, though.</p>

<p>This time, you'll be exploring a mysterious island to try and uncover the fate of a missing CEO, although you'll quickly be drawn into the same type of shenanigans the first game offered. I won't spoil, but this certainly isn't a cozy game, let's put it that way.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is reportedly preparing a massive amount of Switch 2 shipments for the console's first year on sale, with the figure apparently dwarfing that of the original Switch.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which, in turn, cites analyst Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein), Nintendo's supply chain network for the Switch 2 will allow it to sell "more than 20 million units in its first year".</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, that figure would be five million higher than the original Switch, which managed to sell 15 million units during its first year on sale. It's clear that Nintendo is banking on its new console doing well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=DzIoVW6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=msB6_bFT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is preparing its new console for around 20 million shipments in its first year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible the company wants to avoid a repeat of the great chip shortage of the early 2020s, which made consoles like the PS5 and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-shortage-got-you-down-build-your-own-instead" rel="nofollow">original Switch</a> very hard to obtain. It might sound obvious, but Nintendo really doesn't want you not to be able to find this console in stores.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">finally announced</a> the Switch 2 earlier today after months of speculation regarding when the console would finally be revealed.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that the announcement itself was pretty terse; it showed off the console's form factor, as well as what appears to be a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series, but it didn't give away anything about the machine's specs or launch day lineup.</p>

<p>We do, however, already know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be able to play</a> original Switch games, although Nintendo has said that the successor may not support every original Switch game at launch.</p>




<p>Nintendo has promised that it will reveal more about the Switch 2 during a Direct presentation in April. It's likely we'll learn more about the console's hardware specs then, and we'll probably get a release date too. Stay tuned.</p>

It feels unlike most of the company’s past marketing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, let’s look at the Switch 2 teaser/trailer thing real quick. I’m assuming you’ve seen it, but if not, well you are in a for a treat! </p><p>Wowza! The Nintendo 2 looks less like a toy or a big chunk of plastic designed to be unbreakable (like a lot of the company’s past consoles), and more like a modern piece of technology. This first teaser really hammers home that Nintendo wants you to salivate over how much bigger, better, and sleeker the Switch 2 is over its predecessor. </p><p>It’s also very unlike Nintendo to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">zoom in and reveal each and every port and button on the console</a></span>. Sure, it’s done in a whimsical fashion, with the new console evolving from the old one, but it’s still really cool to see Nintendo  point at tiny details and go, “Oh yeah, sweet, huh?” I also appreciate how each new button and port pops out with a tactile motion and noise. It’s good shit. </p><p>This trailer feels more like something Apple or Sony would do to reveal a new console or device; a white void background and super close shots of intricate technical aspects. But then, the controllers start driving around the shiny room and you remember that this is a device made by Nintendo. </p><p>Compare this trailer to the WiiU reveal at E3. </p><p>Or the original Switch reveal eight years ago. </p><p>Those trailers feature people playing the consoles, lots of game footage, more upbeat music, and both focus more on the experience than on the device. For the original Switch, that approach made sense. Nintendo needed to explain its hybrid device to the world.</p><p>Now, with this new sexy teaser for Switch 2, Nintendo doesn’t need to convince the world that a hybrid console is great. Instead, they can show off and tease you about how much better it is than the last one. And you know what? Works for me. I’ll be buying a Switch 2 later this year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced the Nintendo Switch 2</a> on Thursday with a short video to reveal the system. Within the teaser, the company also showed what appeared to be Mario Kart 9 (name pending) running on the system. While there was nothing to really write home about regarding the look at Mario Kart 9, one shot seems to suggest that 24-player races could be a feature of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>A keen-eyed Twitter user (<a href="https://x.com/The_Rimea/status/1879881772852490287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@The_Rimea</a>) spotted the starting grid for a race in the new game, and with it came what appeared to be 24 spots for racers. </p>



<p>“Judging from the starting line, Mario Kart 9(???) seems to have 24 players per race, which is insane,” the post reads alongside the accompanying image that you can see below. For comparison’s sake, there’s also a couple images of the starting grid from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed any details about games coming to the new Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. All that has been confirmed is that both physical and digital original Switch games will be compatible with the new system. In some instances, however, original Switch games “may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2”. </p>



<p>Nintendo is scheduled to hold a Nintendo Direct event fully dedicated to its new console on April 2. It’s expected that the company will announce full specs, a release date, price, and some launch games during the event. Insider Gaming will have full coverage leading up to and during the showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Popular indie FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortunes-run/">Fortune's Run</a> won't be seeing any updates for a while--about three years, to be precise, as that's how long its sole developer, known only as Dizzie, will be spending behind bars.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have some stuff going on I need to make public as it's going to interrupt development," Dizzie <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">shared in a post</a> on the game's Steam page. "I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years. It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WGagabyqUc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7WGagabyqUc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this," he added. "I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions."</p><p dir="ltr">Described by Dizzie as a "fast-paced melee boom-shoot fighting game platformer action immersive sim role-playing fever dream adventure story," Fortune's Run's only other developer recently left the project. According to Dizzie, his former co-developer left for a number of reasons, one of which was a series of struggles she faced after what the post describes as a "botched surgery."</p><p dir="ltr">"The other developer has left the project," Dizzie wrote. "Once she recovered [from surgery], she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of QA and a few level segments, all of which have been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone, but I actually managed--by basically not sleeping--to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away."</p><p dir="ltr">"Since we decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," He continued. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p dir="ltr">The dev added that he is "no longer in financial dire straits" since Fortune's Run "actually sold OK," and noted that he "should be able to afford rent" once he's released from prison.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a chance that if you wait a few years, I'll be able to cap off the release," he wrote. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that "the game isn't <em>totally</em> dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen [to it]."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie's identity--and the crime for which he is being incarcerated--are not known to the public, though he admits in the blog post that his sentence is the result of violence on his part.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a very violent person [in the past] and I hurt a lot of people in my life," he wrote. "Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that another Fortune's Run update is in the works and will be released before he begins serving his sentence.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah. What about the update, huh? I'm going to put that in the next news post, because it feels weird to uh, put patch notes at the bottom of this blog post."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can any one person describe the entire state of the video game marketplace? Entrepreneur, author, and Epyllion CEO Matthew Ball is certainly giving it a shot. The man who wrote "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ballmetaversebook.com/">The Metaverse</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" is out this week with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">a slide deck</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> full of data and analysis capturing the economic headwinds facing the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's presentation gets to the heart of a very uncomfortable fact: according to analysts, video game spending didn't just fail to grow after the COVID-19 pandemic, it dipped 3.5 percent in 2022 and only climbed back a few percentage points by the end of 2024. Other data points, like a declining amount of playtime in games, are also enough to trigger game developers' anxiety (and mine!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball identifies the slowing growth as being a symptom of major interlocking growth drivers of the period between 2011-2021 (when consoles and mobile devices exploded in capabilities and new social networks came online) losing steam. It's not a pretty picture, but this is a business built on solving big problems by staring them right in the face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His lengthy explanation of the complicated market effects at play might warn investors and executives from investing more in the video game business—but that leaves and opportunity for savvy developers and leaders to slip in and find victories where others retreated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have no doubt this slide deck is bouncing through the inboxes of various studios right now and sliding across the desks of different C-suite execs. If you want to make the most of Ball's data, you'll need to think about how it applies to your day-to-day life. Here are a few takeaways that might resonate with rank-and-file developers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Video game budgets have to come down">Video game budgets have to come down</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is probably thuddingly obvious to many of our readers but Ball's data makes a very clear point: video game budgets are too dang high. The amount of money invested in individual games is becoming more difficult to turn a profit on when a fewer percentage of players are picking up new games every year. "Excluding annual releases, but including sequels, only 6.5 percent of gametime in 2023 was for new games," Ball writes. "Always On" games-as-a-service titles released before 2019 earned the most "gametime" in that year. "Tens of billions in development and marketing investment and thousands of games competed for that 6.5 percent of total players hours (and four titles won half of it)."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the unfortunate poster child for Ball's breakdown here, as his breakdown of sales versus budget of the widely beloved sequel relative to its predecessors shows the heart of the problem. The series' production budget shot from just over $100 million to over $300 million across three games (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Miles Morales</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> clocked in at just over $150 million), but lifetime sales of the series haven't increased exponentially.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pair that against the small market share the series is competing for and the economics become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>rough</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I don't know the fate of the budgets for future Marvel's Spider-Man games, I do know Insomniac is aware players aren't necessarily seeing the payoff of the increased spending, a fact that came out in the frustrating dump of leaked documents obtained by hackers targeting the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now here's where things get hard: how do you reduce budgets? There are only three major tools: lower salaries, lower development time, or lower headcounts. Each has frustrating tradeoffs that in many cases, punish workers and reward executives who ballooned the budgets in the first place.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Devs need to dance with governments">Devs need to dance with governments</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's data points to two obvious ways government regulators could influence the game industry—one explicit, the other implicit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The implicit argument isn't clearly stated, and I wonder if Ball would take issue with my analysis. But reading between the lines, an understated challenge of bigger budgets is this: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>game development is hit brutally hard by the cost of living and inflation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As we discussed last year, the same number of developers you stick on a game costs dramatically different depending on the country you're operating in. Developers in higher-cost-of-living regions are being undermined by ones in lower-cost-of-living regions, and developers in the latter territories risk being exploited because they have less agency to leverage better wages.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's explicit argument targets the purported monopoly Google and Apple have on their mobile platforms. He says that if the iOS and Android app platforms need to "open up." New stores could, among other things, drive competition that lowers the 30 percent "platform fee" claimed by Google and Apple, drive new discoverability methods that connect players to a wider variety of games, and spark innovation for new genres of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both topics may require industry leaders to grit their teeth and press local and national governments in support of regulatory action. Industry lobbying groups to date have largely focused on tax breaks and legislation surrounding the import cost of parts and access to internet bandwidth. That's a lot of work invested into legislation that primarily benefits the world's largest publishers and studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington">Mr. Smith</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's time for video games to go to Washington (or London, Ottowa, etc. etc.).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players respond to exciting &quot;new genres&quot;—but where do new genres come from?">Players respond to exciting "new genres"—but where do new genres come from?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of new game genres, Ball's analysis concludes that the emergence of new game genres could be a shot in the arm for the video game market place. He points to the era of the battle royale genre's as being the kind of event that can drive new growth. The industry, he says, could use a shot of innovation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His suggestions for where new genres might come from are concentrated on possible technological advances in "mass concurrency," "high-bandwidth data streaming," "higher-persistence game worlds," and "cloud native games." His analysis of generative AI also focuses on the technology's potential to introduce new genres, as some developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/hidden-door-ceo-ai-controversy-is-about-value-not-tech">like those at Hidden Door</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are experimenting with.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's technology-focused thinking isn't out of place, as many previous industry advances came out of graphical and rendering advances. But there might be a missing variable here: unpaid modding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many breakout new genres of the 2010s began life as mods (born of unpaid labor) for entirely different games. That goes for MOBAs, battle royale games, tactical shooters like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Counter-Strike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That trend muddies of the waters of where developers can find true innovation that will land with players—and who benefits from it. Valve and Blizzard jumped into action to try and profit off genres built on mods of their games. Meanwhile, Brendan Greene was lucky to find a business partner that could turn his </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ARMA 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">mod into a full game, but Epic Games fast-followed with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so hard it became the defining version of the genre in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A bubbling example of this phenomenon right now might be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s roleplaying servers. Their popularity speaks to Ball's analysis that the next generation of video game players prioritizes social play over competition, and right now Rockstar Games is the beneficiary of unpaid time and labor from players setting up their own mini improv theaters. Will Rockstar build on this audience after the release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Will other developers swoop in to try and eat their lunch?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video game analysts from the early 2000s have a fair bit of egg on their face as one of the few bright spots for the traditional video game marketplace is consistent growth in the world of PC games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/study-pc-gaming-hardware-market-down-not-out">Declining sales around 2010</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> led some to think consoles and mobile would inevitably beat out PC games, which were (and sometimes are) difficult and fiddly to get running.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Twenty years ago, PC's share of non-mobile console spending was 29 percent. It's now 53 percent," writes Ball. "And while console [spending] has stagnated since 2021, PC has grown 20 percent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you jump out of your desk and greenlight another generation of flight simulators, you should check out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> PC spending is growing. "The largest share of Steam users now use Chinese as their default client language (which probably </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>underrepresents</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> China's total share of Steam users)," says Ball.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additional data he shares shows that Chinese client language users are among the group that has grown the most on Steam from December 2021 to September 2024. This group represents what many publishers hope to reach—a "fresh audience" with different tastes and interests than the more calcified existing market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But while Chinese player spending on video games has grown by $39 billion since 2011, only 20 percent of their domestic spending goes to imported titles.

We've seen rustling from South Korea about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">expanded interest in triple-A </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">games alongside the country's longtime passion for free-to-play multiplayer titles, and regions like Brazil and Eastern Europe are following similar trends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're not in those regions, you might wonder how your neck of the game industry can benefit. For now, the best I can offer is that if overseas audience spend more time on consoles and PCs than mobile devices, developers have an opportunity to catch some of that interest by investing in localization.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding player socialization should be a priority">Understanding player socialization should be a priority</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Woven through Ball's analysis is another long-running trend: how players and why socialize through games is changing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> phenomenon, for instance, isn't just about younger players being drawn to blocky graphics and user-generated content, it's that the platform's flexible tools have become a haven for self-expression and social play. We can again look at the proliferation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roleplaying servers as another data point in this phenomenon, and outside of games, the increasing growth of chat platform Discord.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One in five Discord users (or 40 million total) use the app to stream gameplay to their friends each month—and just under one in three watches monthly," Ball notes. It's a piece of social glue that accelerates interest in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Smite 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phasmophobia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord's list of users playing Steam Early Access titles as a share of total observed players is largely loaded with co-op multiplayer games, but also features single-player titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria, Hades II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Ball describes this as "disproportionate" game discovery behavior.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers behind these games probably didn't do any weird science studying the habits of Discord users (unless they did, in which case, hey reach out to me I want to know what you learned), but enough of them have succeeded on the platform in a way that suggests studying how players engage with and use Discord might be a vector for developers to grow, explore new genres, and succeed in 2025 and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(And Discord may not deserve all the credit here—social apps across the globe likely drive similar behavior in different regions).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do developers handle an uncertain future?">How do developers handle an uncertain future?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'll be honest here. When I first read Ball's report, I came away with some degree of anxiety. The human brain struggles to wrangle numbers like these, and it's easy to spiral into an unhelpful spree of if-&gt;then statements that make a decline in billions of dollars in spending feel like the end of the world. The problems and solutions are so big and abstract that if you aren't a big-money decision maker—just a humble programmer, artist, designer, or a writer like me—you can feel like you have no agency in a field you deeply love. And even if you have the power to greenlight a game, what if the games Ball is proposing aren't the ones you want to or even can make?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The solution, I think, is to look at Ball's data and analysis as a map. Maps don't serve one purpose—they lay out the territory as best they can so another traveler can navigate it. Plenty will read Ball's map and see "X marks the spot" where others will see "here there be dragons."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You don't have to change or fix the game industry. But to make the game you want to make, having a map handy might keep you from sailing into dangerous waters.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony Pictures has released the first full trailer for its Until Dawn horror film.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">teaser was released</a> that hinted towards how the game's branching narrative would be replicated in the film.</p>
<p>Now, in this full trailer, we can see how the plot revolves (literally) around an hourglass with the cast repeatedly waking up after gruesome deaths to try their luck at surviving once again.</p>

<p>Though the plot differs from the original game - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">features a new cast</a> - there are plenty of horror tropes: from the haunted house setting, masked slayers, and chases thwarted by bear traps, to creepy zombie-like monsters and a particularly nasty looking face infection.</p>
<p>"Every night holds a clue," the trailer reads. "Every death brings you closer to the truth."</p>
<p>Then: "If we want to survive, we have to make it until dawn," says one character nodding. He said the name!</p>
<p>The film is set to release exclusively in cinemas on 25th April.</p>
<p>As for the original game, it received a PS5 and PC remake in October last year and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel"> includes a new ending</a> that points towards a possible sequel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
