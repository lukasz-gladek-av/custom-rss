            <p>
Last year, myself, Brendy and Graham  got fearfully excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>, a bountiful free 1v1 FPS with map designs calibrated to nostalgiafuck anybody who ever played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> over an LAN or hoarded shareware CDs. Our fever burned all the hotter for knowing that Straftat is the work of them wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, the amazing Brutalist exploration game from 2022.
</p>
<p>
Brendy and Graham have now left the Treehouse, alas, so there is nobody here to get excited with me about VHOLUME, a first-person parkour game from one of the Straftat developers. I am sitting alone in my room, sorrowfully punching the air, tears pooling around my ankles and threatening to short-circuit the PC. Just as well it's a single player experience, I guess.

<p>
VHOLUME is the work of Léonard Lemaitre, the aforesaid Straftat dev, plus Nathan Grange and Niels Tiercelin, who I'm not familiar with. It's being published by IronEqual. The game casts you as Robert, a man galloping through "the derelict capital of Afro-Eurasia", ruled by a tyrannical Ministry. He's on a mission to restore his family's revoked ration tickets. Quite what this has to do with parkour remains to be seen. It doesn't look like there are any other humans in the setting.
</p><p>
It's another dystopian Brutalist world of canted slabs, yawning concrete turbines, and slit windows stacked in such a way as to inspire massive trypophobia. In some of the screens, it looks like there's some liveable urban architecture. In others, it looks like a continuation of Straftat's abstract level mash-up ethos, with blocks jutting from mist.</p>
<p>The tech is less 90s than that of Straftat or Babbdi, with softer, diffuse lighting and shadows. I'm not sure which aesthetic I prefer. VHOLUME is a handsome beast, but it's sort of like they rubbed Straftat down with scented oils.
</p>
<p>
Expect "movement-centric gameplay where the player can jump, run, climb and slide with great freedom". True princes of parkour "can exploit momentum, discover shortcuts, and break the labyrinthine design, making each run a test of skill and efficiency as they chase target times."</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, and no trailer, but you can find some gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131730/VHOLUME/">Steam page</a>. I imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> fans who can live without the radiance of that game's City of Glass might enjoy this. As will people who relished last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>.</p>

<p>"The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> Rally physics engine continues its evolution with the introduction of all-new Snow Physics and support for studded tyres," Supernova wrote in their <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-rally-ea-0-2-out-now/">announcement</a> of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/514103843981624359?l=english">update 2.0</a>. "Rally drivers must now adapt to a dedicated layer of technical challenge, where control and precision are pushed to their absolute limits under low-grip conditions."</p>
<p>Despite that snow chat, there aren't any full snow stages in the game just yet, with this update instead bringing the Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit - an ice and snow track you can use to get some practice in via AC Rally's time attack and free practice modes. The other addition's a fresh car, the iconic Alpine A110 group 4 coupe, which won the Monte Carlo rally in 1973. It's an utterly beautiful blue machine, and I can't think of many better cars Supernova could have picked to look good as they slide past the snowbanks.</p><p>Anyway, my petrolheading aside, this update also brings a number of handy tweaks. "Based on new field research and validation from professional rally drivers, the gravel and tarmac physics and tyre models have been improved across the board," Supernova wrote. "The force feedback system also sees several fixes and refinements, including better consistency and improved behaviour under braking." The likes of general wheel support and car sound mixing have also gotten attention. Finally, there are 25 new events to give a go.</p>
<p>I'll definitely be making time to give AC Rally another extended go over Christmas, having not currently been back to see how I find it now Supernova have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/803457048228397793?l=english">deployed a fix</a> for the Logitech G29 wheel-specific issues that marred <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-looks-the-part-as-it-heads-into-early-access-but-ive-found-its-driving-a-numb-struggle">my pre-release rallying</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to make sure you have power no matter what, a power station is something you should absolutely invest in. It doesn’t matter if you’re dealing with a storm or another type of emergency, it can help you ensure you’ve got enough power to at least keep food warm, make sure you have a phone to use, or other small electronics that you need to survive.</p>
<p>That’s why the EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station RIVER 2 Pro is a great choice. Not only is it a compact and versatile power solution that brings reliable energy to almost any situation, but it’s made even more affordable with the recent discount we found at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, it’s just $315, down from its usual price of $530. That’s a discount of $215 and 40% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable power station perfect for emergencies</h2>
<p>This power station has enough capacity to keep things like phones, laptops, lights, small appliances, and even medical devices running when you need them. You get a full suite of outlets, including AC ports for larger electronics and USB ports for smaller gadgets. That means you can charge or power several things at once without needing a bunch of adapters or cords.</p>
<p>Once the power station has been depleted, you can charge it up super quickly. All you have to do is plug it into a wall outlet, use a car charger while you are on the road, or hook it up to compatible solar panels if you are off the grid. Fast recharge means you are not stuck waiting for power to come back after it drains. It also gives you more flexibility to adapt to different situations no matter where you are.</p>



<p>Another practical benefit is the LCD screen on the front that shows how much power you have left. You can check battery levels quickly and easily, so you can plan how long the unit will last for your devices.</p>
<p>The RIVER 2 Pro also feels sturdy and well made. The case is easy to grip and looks like it can stand up to road trips, camping gear, or daily use in a workshop or garage. It does not matter if you are an occasional user or someone who really needs power on the go, the build quality gives you confidence.</p>
<p>Overall, the EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station RIVER 2 Pro offers a lot of useful features in a compact package. And it’s really a solid deal for anyone looking to add reliable portable power to their gear list. For this price, you’ll get something you can keep and use in an emergency. And if you just need it for an inconvenience, it’s helpful for that as well. Now that it’s time for cold weather that could culminate in emergencies, you might think about grabbing one just in case.</p>

                <p>Bethesda veteran Harvey Smith has reflected on the closure of Arkane Austin and the struggles of the studio's final game, Redfall. For anyone just catching up, Arkane Austin made the vampire game Redfall under Smith's leadership. After the live-service game failed to find an audience after launch in May 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closed the studio a year later and ended most support for the game.</a></p><p>Smith appeared on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3EnIalRh2rZEybRJnkhwmM?si=wmcGPRxqSb-UMRMDEYB-GA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a> recently and said (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deus-ex-designer-former-arkane-studio-director-reflects-on-closure-redfall-disastrous-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>), "Every company makes the decisions they make for the reasons they make them."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Redfall Review - Half-Staked</p>
      </div>
<p>For Arkane Austin's closure, Smith said the "shock" was that Arkane--as a wider group that also comprised Dishonored studio Arkane Lyon--made well-received and commercially successful games.</p><p>"Creative efforts are unpredictable," he said. "It was a shock at first, but who I really felt for were the people who were new, this was their first project or they'd only been in the industry for a while."</p><p>Naturally, Smith said he did not agree with the choice to close Arkane Austin, saying he believed "very much" in the studio's future. "We were working on something super cool," he said.</p><p>As for Redfall's struggles, Smith said the game's 1.4 update--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shuttered-studio-arkane-austin-releases-ambitious-final-patch-for-redfall/1100-6523830/" data-ref-id="1100-6523830">released after word came that Arkane Austin would close</a>--delivered a lot of improvements that might have saved the game had they been there at launch.</p><p>"If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story," he said.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/" data-ref-id="1900-6418062">Redfall review</a> scored the game a 4/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Ultimately, Redfall is a game that should not have been released yet."</p><p>Arkane Lyon is now working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-is-bullish-on-microsoft-disney-partnership-for-indiana-jones-and-blade/1100-6527810/" data-ref-id="1100-6527810">new Blade game with Marvel</a>, but it's been some time since we've seen or heard anything about it. </p>

            <p>When Microsoft decided to pull the plug on its Perfect Dark reboot earlier this year, we weren't the only ones to be taken by surprise, with Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan stating she was "absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded".</p>
<p>In fact, Wilton Regan - who has just been announced as the new Lara Croft - said when she was told the project was cancelled, she was "as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">adding she found out at the same time as the rest of us</a>.</p>

<p>"I did not see it coming," Wilton Regan told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/">TheGamer</a>. "We were basically recording bits and bobs throughout '23. We were also doing lots of performance capture for it in '24, and we were even recording more stuff for it in '25. To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I'd done entire chapters of this universe."</p>
<p>According to the actress - who has also had roles in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three - the Perfect Dark reboot had "delivered several milestones that the client was really happy with", though she was unsure how far along The Initiative was in terms of the game's overall development.</p><p>"It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded," Wilton Regan continued. "There was an ecosystem of creativity and collaboration that was in place that we lost overnight. It was really difficult, really difficult for everybody."</p>
<p>For a little while after its cancellation, those close to the project hoped it may survive. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two. Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>. However, it did not.</p>
<p>"That was the day I was really sad because that was the day I lost hope," Wilton Regan said. "Initially, when it made it to the press that Perfect Dark was being defunded, a lot of people reached out for comments about it, both in the media, as well as personally, friends, and professionally, colleagues.</p>
<p>"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><p>Wilton Regan said Perfect Dark's shock cancellation was like nothing she had experienced in her career to date. "And I guess now that I know that it can happen, you become really frightened that the same thing could happen again," she admitted.</p>
<p>While losing the role of Joanna Dark was understandably devastating for Wilton Regan, the actress was able to move her focus to other projects, notably as Lara Croft in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, which she called her "saving grace". But, there are clearly still some scars leftover from Perfect Dark's cancellation, and Wilton Regan admitted she is "frightened about losing Lara" like she lost Joanna.</p>
<p>"I was playing Joanna over here, and I was playing Lara over here, which was wonderful and genuinely one of the most creatively exciting times of my life," Wilton Regan closed. "And I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara. I'm still frightened of losing Lara." Let's all hope that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Wilton Regan is taking over the role of Lara Croft from Camilla Luddington, who played the globe-trotting Tomb Raider lead in the rebooted Survivor trilogy.

<p>Come on, grab your friends</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/powerwash_simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> racked up some pretty impressive crossover DLC in its time, and its sequel looks like it'll start doing the same next year.</p>
<p>FuturLab has today lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>'s first DLC pack, featuring none other than a handful of locales from the beloved Cartoon Network series, <strong>Adventure Time</strong>. We don't have all that much information on what areas from the Land of Ooo will need a scrubbing, though the developer has confirmed that there will be <em>five</em> of them, each of which can be tackled with up to three pals.</p>
<p>Here's all of the information we have on the DLC so far from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4173830/PowerWash_Simulator_2__Adventure_Time_Pack/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clean Up Distant Lands</strong><br>
Who wants to play video games?! Clean up five new levels from the Land of Ooo. Don’t worry, everything stays right where you left it, but just a little bit cleaner.<br>
<strong>Grab Your Friends Or Adventure Solo<br></strong>Homies help homies, always. So, brave the filth solo, grab your BFF to clean through the campaign together, or grab your 4-man band to shred schmutz in free-play.<br>
<strong>What Time Is It?<br></strong>It’s not quite Adventure Time… yet! UNACCEPTABLE, we know, but we’re still putting the finishing touches (aka: dirt) on everything. Right now, you have only an approximate knowledge of what’s to come, so be sure to Wishlist, join the Discord and follow our socials to stay up to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no precise release date on this one just yet, outside of a vague 'Spring 2026' window, so we'll be keeping an eye out for more details in the coming months.</p>

		<p>Tribute Games has announced a new update for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, with this patch addressing some more gameplay bugs. Some of the bugs that have now been squashed include Special Attack Assemble achievement not unlocking in online mode, various freeze and crash issues across PC and consoles, and subtitles for Spider-Man’s dialogue for a specific battle have also been added. You can see the full list of fixes below.</p>

<li>We’ve fixed an issue where move lists were displaying incorrectly in multiplayer, if Player One was using a keyboard<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also had a chat with Hela to ensure she doesn’t get bored and go idle if host players leave a multiplayer game during the fight<wbr></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has denied that it has any kind of partnership with controversial streaming service Kick, following a string of social media posts by the latter that could be construed to mean otherwise.</p><p>Yesterday, the official Kick X account <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001095322265862315/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">posted an image</a> of two people shaking hands, one of whom is holding a package that bears both the Xbox and Kick logos. The image was accompanied by text that simply read "kick (handshake emoji) xbox".</p><p>That image was preceded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2000732922005848225" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">an animation</a> that resembles the original Xbox's startup sequence (but with the Kick logo replacing the Xbox branding, of course), and was succeeded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001458279126532297" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a video</a> showing someone unboxing a Kick-themed original Xbox.

The app is currently being "actively evaluated", and if it's found to breach Xbox's policies, it will be removed.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-66044165" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">garnered controversy</a> since its foundation in 2022, partly due to its close links to the gambling industry; while Twitch has banned gambling-related content from its platform, Kick still hosts gambling streams, and its founders, Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani, are also behind crypto casino Stake.</p><p>The platform has also become known for welcoming creators who have been banned or censured by other services, including the likes of&nbsp;Félix "xQc" Lengyel and Kaitlyn "Amouranth" Siragusa, among others.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-new-enterprise-fee-report</link>
            <guid>1387333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has reportedly introduced a new fee that it's asking some of its Enterprise customers to pay, and the "minimum commitment" for which the engine is apparently asking is not small.</p><p>According to <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/unity-risks-fresh-backlash-with-new-fee-demands-this-feels-like-blackmail/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, emails have been sent out by Unity this week targeting "bigger Unity customers" and detailing a new fee that begins at $250,000 and rises to $2 million for the largest proponents.</p><p>The fee, apparently referred to as a "minimum commitment program" by Unity, supposedly "requires that [developers] pay Unity a specified minimum commitment amount at the commencement of each Subscription Year", with the fee based on gross revenue earned by the developer in question.</p><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is just one of the many games that was made in Unity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Mobilegamer.biz's sources, developers with revenue between $25 million and $50 million will need to pay $250,000 to Unity, with the amount rising in direct proportion to revenue. Those who have made over $250 million will need to pay $2 million of that to Unity.</p><p>The engine says that the fees will go towards "your purchase of Unity subscription license and support products", and Mobilegamer.biz's sources claim that developers are threatened with termination if they fail to pay the new fee.</p><p>It probably goes without saying that Unity can ill afford another hit to its public relations right now; the company is arguably still recovering from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c2e9dbd5-693e-4701-a45d-1f172ca61b44" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the controversy</a> that was ignited after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d8418f6-6d83-477d-97b7-f18aa50e0a89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the introduction</a> of the so-called "runtime fee" in 2023.</p><p>In that particular case, Unity <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed48a89b-b13e-4d2a-b975-298530ddbc6a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reversed its decision</a> fairly swiftly, and then-CEO John Riccitello subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61146301-1035-4016-acad-04d27c632ca1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>. Whether this fee will have a similar effect remains to be seen, but it would seem to be an ill omen for Unity's future direction, at any rate.</p>
<p>Unity hasn't technically announced this new fee in a public-facing capacity, so we'll have to wait and see if it decides to do so and what the reaction will be if and when that happens. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Party Game (Just Dance 2026 Edition) Is 50% Off After 80K+ Sold, Still Arrives Before Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-party-game-just-dance-2026-edition-is-50-off-after-80k-sold-still-arrives-before-christmas-2000654283</link>
            <guid>1387321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="906">With the holiday season right around the corner, many people are preparing to spend long afternoons and evenings gathered with extended family under one roof. While that time together can be meaningful, it can also be challenging to keep everyone entertained for hours on end. After the big meals are finished and the conversations start looping, it helps to have a fun activity ready that can pull everyone together. A lively party game is often the perfect solution, and <strong><em data-start="473" data-end="498">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em></strong> fits that role beautifully. Instead of sitting around scrolling on phones or drifting into awkward debates, family members of all ages can jump up, move their bodies, and share a few laughs. Even better, there’s a timely deal that makes it easier to justify adding it to your holiday lineup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/">Amazon is currently offering the Nintendo Switch version at half off, dropping the price from $50 down to just $25.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="906">A Party Games Everyone Can Enjoy</h2>
<p data-start="908" data-end="1716">One of the biggest draws of <em data-start="936" data-end="961">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> is its impressive music lineup. The <em data-start="998" data-end="1010">Just Dance</em> franchise has been a staple of rhythm and dance gaming since its debut in 2009 during the Wii era, and its longevity speaks to how well the formula still works. Year after year, Ubisoft continues to refresh the experience with new tracks that appeal to a wide audience. This latest entry includes 40 new songs spanning modern pop hits, beloved throwbacks, and internet-fueled favorites. Players can dance along to chart-toppers like “APT.” by ROSÉ &amp; Bruno Mars and “Houdini” by Dua Lipa, as well as classics such as “Counting Stars” by OneRepublic and Madonna’s “Hung Up.” I’m personally most excited by the inclusion of “All Star” by Smash Mouth.</p>
<p>If you already own older versions of the game like <em>Just Dance 2024 Edition </em>or<em> Just Dance 2025 Edition</em>, you don’t have to worry about splitting your content across different menus. All your songs are accessible in one unified platform. Online play is also streamlined, allowing friends to dance together regardless of which yearly edition they own. On top of that, players can subscribe to Just Dance+, which unlocks hundreds of additional tracks and rotating in-game events.</p>



<p>Beyond being a crowd-pleasing party game, <em>Just Dance</em> also doubles as a surprisingly effective fitness tool. For those looking to stay active during the colder months, Workout Mode offers a fun way to build movement into daily routines. Instead of forcing yourself through a repetitive exercise plan, you can burn calories while dancing to music you enjoy. It’s a great option for players who want something more engaging than traditional workouts, whether they’re dancing solo or with others.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the physical version of<em> Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> doesn’t include a game cartridge. Instead, the box contains a download code that you redeem on your Nintendo Switch, after which the game is downloaded directly to your console.&nbsp;If you don’t want to wait and just want the code, you can order the digital version. Though it is still full price at $50, so it might be better to just wait for the empty box to ship.</p>

Most of us anyway. The sun is setting on 2025 and I have to say each year of the game industry's ongoing economic contraction has found new fresh ways to torment us (and occasionally delight us. There was SOME good news this year!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimists and pessimists will have plenty to chew on with this year's most notable trends. The optimists in game development will see an industry in the midst of great change, finally beginning to move past the unrelenting layoffs and studio closures that dogged it since 2022. The old world is dying, the new world is being born, and birth is of course, a painful process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cynics may look at the last year and see a far different picture: one of exploitation. Of workers, of players—even of studio heads. The biggest winners of the year were indubitably those who could turn a buck off of the hard work of others: the rent-seekers, the CEOs, the do-nothing YouTubers...it was a banner year for profiting off the pain of others.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which camp do I fall in? Ah, dear reader, consider that to understand both points of view I am forced to hold both of them in my head. Picture the sound of two sawblades grinding against each other and you'll understand what it feels like to process the complex state of the video game industry.

The sad truth is that it's as bad for what remains of professional game journalism, with several publications shuttering in the last few years, or seeing the injustice of their shambling remains trotted out by increasingly hollow media companies.

<p>The ver. 1.1 update, 'The Threads of Fate', will launch at some point in "<strong>Early 2026</strong>" (the studios haven't been more precise than that at the moment), and will bring a healthy dose of new content alongside the usual tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<p>First up is a batch of new 'Mystic Ordeal' challenges, which will let you add challenging quirks to your runs to put your skills to the test — you'll even be able to set your own rules and share them with others via a code. Select stages of your journey across Talamh will also become corrupted, with stronger enemies therein granting bigger rewards. Don't worry if you're finding the base game challenging enough; both of these will be completely optional.</p><div><figure data-videoid="NHONnA_kS_M" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytNHONnA_kS_M" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed64cc89sljkpz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The devs are also introducing newly evolved mounts that pack more of a punch, and a batch of fresh in-game skins and emotes, so you can get your party looking as sharp as they deserve.</p>

<p>The devs shared a full rundown of the upcoming changes in a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673">Steam</a>, concluding by thanking everyone who has played so far: "We wanted to take a moment, once again, to thank you for joining our rebellion, and lending your skills, passion and personality to our resistance movement."</p>
<p>We had a great time with Absolum on Switch earlier this year, calling it "one of the best of its kind, whatever that kind may be" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">9/10 review</a>. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long in 2026 to see its updates come our way.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>1387288</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/samson-is-a-new-action-game-by-former-just-cause-devs-new-studio/">Samson</a> was revealed by Christofer Sundberg’s Liquid Swords studio, showing a gritty open world game set in the city of Tyndalston. The main story sees Samson in a mountain of debt so he needs to take on all sorts of jobs to try and clear it, or suffer the consequences. Now, a new FAQ about Samson has gone live, with the key points being the story is about 10 hours but exploring everything can take around 25 hours, and the game will be coming to consoles but after the PC launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435">Samson FAQ</a> has also confirmed that the game is expected in early 2026 and will be priced at $24.99. There is no multiplayer and no microtransactions, with Samson being a single player title. There will be localisation, with different languages steadily being rolled out, but this will only apply to text as voice acting will not be localised. For the gameplay, players will be able to unlock new perks but won’t have a standard weapon loadout. Instead items in the environment can be picked and used for fights, while vehicle combat will also be heavy and a core part of the game. There has been some influence from Just Cause, the series Christofer Sundberg is credited with creating, but not in the chaotic and silly sense. It will be much more grounded with outcomes that could be unpredictable. You can drive any car in the game, but you won’t be able to drag civilians out of their vehicles. Instead stealing cars that are parked seems to be the way to get a new ride, though this will draw attention. Each vehicle will have its own handling style, which then leans into each one being useful for different playstyles.</p>
<p>According to the FAQ the city will respond to Samson’s actions too. It says,<em> “Law enforcement escalates based on your actions. Civilians react to what you do and how you behave.&nbsp; For example you need to watch out if you steal a parked car, if the police are nearby, they will spot and pursue you. They’ll escalate their efforts as you try to shake them off, making for an intense experience, testing all of your skills and knowledge about the city to escape. The city responds. It does not just sit there.”&nbsp;</em>It goes on to say this about police chases. <em>“Law enforcement is something to respect. Chases escalate, pressure builds, and mistakes matter. The goal is tension, not spectacle for its own sake.”</em></p>

<p>The PC minimum specs have also been confimed for Samson and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OS:</b>&nbsp;Windows 11<wbr></li>
<li><b>Processor:</b>&nbsp;6 cores<wbr></li>
<li><b>Memory:</b>&nbsp;16 GB RAM<wbr></li>
<li><b>Graphics:</b>&nbsp;NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card<wbr></li>
<li><b>Storage:</b>&nbsp;15 GB free space</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-support-yakuza-kiwami-2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-ark-lost-colony/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/aion2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">Another five games have received support</a> for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation this week, including Yakuza Kiwami 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and ARK: Lost Colony. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-dying-light-the-beast-update-1-5-nightmare-experience/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> adds support for ray-tracing, Lost Ark added support for DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA put out a new GeForce Ready game driver to support it all.</p>



<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">the return of Splitgate 2</a>, and the first Splitgate, as developer 1047 Games has opted to try and mash together the best of both games into one offering for players. It arrived as a free-to-play game on PC and consoles everywhere as of yesterday, December 17, and has support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to ensure that you can get the most out of your hardware. It's also the exact kind of game you'd want to play at the highest frame rate possible, as a competitive first-person shooter.</p>



<p>If you are playing it, that is. Splitgate 2's launch went very poorly, and, while SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, at least on PC, the release of Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m">doesn't seem to have turned things around</a> when looking at the concurrent player numbers.</p>



<p>For Yakuza Kiwami 2, a recent update to the game added DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, and now, if you load it up alongside the NVIDIA app, you can boost your experience further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with the app's DLSS overrides.</p>



<p>MMORPG Ashes of Creation, which recently launched as a new early access title on PC, also did so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. Also, speaking of SteamDB numbers, it's one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4124950/charts/">trending games on the platform at the time of this writing</a>. </p>



<p>ARK: Lost Colony and AION2 are the final two games to round out the five that are getting support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, with AION2 getting support on December 24, 2025, as part of a new update, and ARK: Lost Colony featuring support for DLSS 4 today as part of a new update.</p>



<p>Lastly, today's new GeForce Game Ready driver will ensure that you're able to jump into all of these games without issue, as it fixes a colour issue from the previous driver and several other bug fixes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, the hopes of the Half-Life community were sparked by rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 is not only in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">active development</a></strong>, but also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">in the polishing and optimization phase</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/"><strong>close to an announcement.</strong></a> Now that we are so close to the holidays, however, it's unlikely that even a company like Valve that operates on its own set of rules will announce the project before the end of the year, as previously rumored.</p>



<p>The now-legendary game not being announced in 2025 has shattered the hopes of many, who no longer believe a new entry in the series will be released in the near future. However, the lack of an official announcement shouldn't make you lose hope, as the project rumored to be the third entry in the Valve series hasn't been abandoned. On the contrary, it has received a new update which is sure to spark new hope in fans.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV"><strong>Tyler McVicker</strong></a>, who has provided an in-depth look at the latest updates made to the HLX project found in the Source 2 engine in the past, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/commit/5688664efb6b3a0e6a52abec53f8d0d7990d1f71"><strong>Dota 2 December 16 2025 update</strong></a> introduced new strings of code directly related to the project rumored to be Half-Life 3.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Based on how the Half-Life community lately, should I even make a video detailing the dump of new information found in the latest DOTA 2 update? </p><p>I don't know...</p><p>I guess this game doesn't exist.... Oh well.... <a href="https://t.co/nFcNYv9ynt">pic.twitter.com/nFcNYv9ynt</a></p></div>— Tyler "Hype Merchant" McVicker (@Tyler_McV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/2001331835373265408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While an in-depth explanation of what these new additions mean for the HLX project has yet to be provided, the community verified that these updates are real and confirmed on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">this comprehensive community-managed Miro board</strong></a> that they are related to the Animgraph 2 system, a new animation resolve system designed to replace the previous system, which caused large bandwidth consumption in multiplayer games. For those not interested in game development, these additions are still important to know about, as it is undeniable proof that the development of HLX is proceeding.</p>



<p>What these updates don't suggest, on the other hand, is when the HLX project will be officially revealed. According to rumors, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/">Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch game targeting a Spring 2026 release</a></strong>, so if these plans haven't changed, it shouldn't be long until we will finally learn if and how the iconic series by Valve will continue following the VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-unveiled-next-month/"><strong>Half-Life: Alyx.</strong></a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione have announced that they’ve repaid all the money they borrowed to develop their Surrealist horror game Horses, despite being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">denied release on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ban-santa-ragiones-horses-just-before-release-with-a-weird-reminder-that-adult-only-nft-games-are-fine-though">the Epic Games Store</a>. It’s a better outcome than expected, given Steam’s centrality to PC gaming, and a strong demonstration of support for art that is prepared to disregard taboos and investigate something profoundly ugly. It’s also, however, not enough to keep Santa Ragione operational. </p>
<p>As warned when they broke their silence about the Steam ban last month, the developers are suspending operations and looking for other work. It’s possible they’ll get the band back together down the road, but this “will not be easy”.</p><!--more-->
<p>According to Santa Ragione, Horses has sold 18,000 copies across all platforms since launch on GOG, Humble and Itch, generating around $65,000 in net revenue. Back in November, the developers told us that they had borrowed roughly $50,000 from friends to complete development, following the Steam ban, with the overall budget running to $100,000.</p>
<p>“After paying the royalties owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of HORSES, these proceeds will be sufficient to repay the loans we took to finish development,” reads a press release, sent to RPS last night. “We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved.</p><p>“At the same time, this result is not enough to begin production on a new game,” it continues. “The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.”</p>
<p>Steam rejected a work-in-progress version of Horses in June 2023. The platform holder’s reasons for doing so remain unclear, but according to a Valve statement circulated by Santa Ragione themselves, the platform holder’s reviewers were concerned about depictions of "sexual conduct involving a minor". The developers subsequently altered the game to make all the characters visibly over 20 years old. They have also argued that while Horses does contain portrayals of sexual abuse of many kinds, it does not seek to arouse or glorify.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviewed Horses</a>, and while I haven’t played and therefore can’t speak for the WIP build from June 2023, this absolutely isn’t a work of child pornography. It’s a story of sexual oppression and brutalisation, which considers censorship as a form of sadism. The violence it depicts is portrayed as being technologically mediated via both an in-game projector and various self-referential pieces of design. It very clearly isn’t intended to be received as ‘unfiltered’ representation and endorsement. To claim otherwise is to misunderstand the game or, worse, twist it out of context.</p>
<p>In this week’s statement about sales, Santa Ragione write that the Steam ban precipitated “a prolonged scramble for funding, with debt, opportunity cost, and team members taking other work”. In other words, the studio had already begun to fragment long before Santa Ragione went public about Valve’s decision.</p><p>The developers also note that while Horses has been a relative hit at launch, the game will miss out on the long-term revenue from Steam’s many sales and bundle offers. “Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles,” they write. “These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like.” </p>
<p>I’m interested to hear more about the key distribution situation. Santa Ragoine have previously criticised Valve for declining to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" featuring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>, their previous well-regarded horror game.</p>
<p>The developers conclude by refocussing attention on Valve’s role as de facto industry regulator and censor, given the size of its share of the PC gaming market. They write that stronger-than-expected sales of Horses “should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. </p>
<p>“For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly,” the statement concludes.</p><p>To continue the theme from that closing sentence, the news that Steam had banned Horses came following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a wider crackdown on adult games</a> across both Valve’s platform and indie storefront Itch.io. This summer, Valve and Itch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">altered their</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">submission terms</a> to give international payment processing networks a say over the definition of acceptable adult material.</p>
<p>The payment networks themselves appear to have tightened their rules <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">under pressure</a> from anti-misogyny groups and anti-pornography activists with ultra-conservative leanings. There is a counter-campaign underway to force the payment networks to reverse policy, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.com/post/3m7gd2poyk22y">organised</a> by community figures such as journalist and Youtuber Ana Valens. We will likely have more reporting on the subject next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LG Clears This 32″ Ultragear Gaming Monitor (240Hz, OLED, 3ms, 4K), Now Cheaper Than 27″ Model]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-clears-this-32-ultragear-gaming-monitor-240hz-oled-3ms-4k-now-cheaper-than-27-model-2000654534</link>
            <guid>1387264</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>OLED gaming monitors used to mean choosing between your rent money and screen quality, but that gap keeps shrinking: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/">LG’s 32-inch Ultragear just hit $876 on Amazon, dropping $523 from its $1,399 list price</a> to reach an all-time low right before the holidays. This isn’t some Black Friday leftover either, as <strong>Amazon guarantees delivery before Christmas if you order soon</strong>.</p>
<p>The combination of <strong>4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, 0.03ms response time and true OLED blacks</strong> makes this monitor work equally well for competitive gaming sessions and those movie nights when you want visuals that actually impress.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Flexibility Really Means Something Useful</h2>
<p>The Dual Mode feature is more important than most marketing fluff because it really changes how you use the monitor every day: When you’re playing open-world games or story-driven games where graphics quality is more important than quick reactions, <strong>switch to 4K at 240Hz</strong>. When you’re playing competitive shooters, MOBAs, or racing games where every millisecond counts and clarity isn’t as important as responsiveness,<strong> use a hotkey to switch to Full HD at 480Hz</strong>. That 480Hz mode isn’t just a number on a spec sheet: it really does make motion blur almost invisible when you pan the camera quickly or flick it quickly.</p>



<p>The<strong> 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time</strong> gets rid of ghosting and trailing that slower panels have, which is especially noticeable during dark scenes or when characters move quickly. This speed is possible because OLED technology lets each pixel turn on and off right away, instead of waiting for liquid crystals to twist like LCD panels do. You’ll be able to see enemies coming out of the shadows faster, follow moving targets more accurately, and play the game in a way that feels like it’s connected to your inputs instead of lagging behind them.</p>



<p>LG added Micro Lens Array+ technology to this Ultragear which boosts<strong> normal brightness to 275 nits and peak brightness to 1300 nits</strong> which makes it the brightest OLED gaming display in their lineup. That brightness is more important than you might think, because OLED monitors can have trouble in bright rooms but this panel does well against window glare and overhead lights. The VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification means that the monitor meets strict industry standards for both brightness peaks and the very deep blacks that OLED displays are known for. The 1.5 million to 1 contrast ratio gives images depth that LCD monitors can’t match. It shows details in dark game scenes that would be lost in murky gray on lower-quality displays.</p>
<p>The a<strong>nti-glare coating</strong> cuts down on reflections without adding that annoying grainy texture that some matte screens have which means you can focus on the game instead of having to change the lighting in your room all the time. The built-in speakers make surprisingly punchy bass-driven sound that works for casual gaming and streaming without needing external speakers.</p>
<p>The LG Switch app turns the monitor into a productivity powerhouse between gaming sessions by letting you split the screen into up to six customizable sections for doing more than one thing at a time. You can manage video calls, look through documents, and keep an eye on chat windows all at the same time. You can also switch between your PC input and the built-in webOS streaming platform for Netflix and YouTube without having to touch your computer.<strong> DisplayPort 2.1 and USB Type-C connections</strong> make sure your setup will work with next-generation graphics cards and give you enough bandwidth to push 4K at 240Hz without compression.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: In a market where similar specs usually cost $1,200 to $1,500, $876 for a 32-inch OLED gaming monitor with dual refresh modes, HDR 400 certification, and sub-millisecond response times is a great deal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After comments this week from Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealing that the </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> developer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>using generative AI in its workflow</span></a><span> prompted a massive backlash on social media, several developers have been weighing in. While Vincke said most of Larian’s workers were “okay” with how the team had integrated the technology, the public outcry </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934"><span>from fans and developers</span></a><span> told a different story. The latest games industry veterans to weigh in include </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> lead Daniel Vávra and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-co-directors-new-game-couldnt-be-more-different-2000653042"><span>ex-Naughty Dog director Bruce Straley</span></a><span>, and both of them seem to think generative AI is here to stay in game development, though one of them is at least standing firm against the trend for now.</span></p> <p><span>Vávra posted a lengthy response to Vincke’s statements </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169"><span>on X</span></a><span>, saying that while he’s “no fan of of AI generated art,” detractors need to “face [the] reality” that it’s here to stay.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>You know what I hate most about making games? The fact that it takes 7 years and 300 people and tens of millions of dollars to make. And the fact that Tom had to spend 500 hours in the studio recording completely generic heckling and generic bars.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I’m all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won’t have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they’ll have to focus on the essentials.</span></p> <p><span>I have ideas for lots of games, but I’m fifty years old and so far it’s taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I’m all for it.</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LarAtLarian</a>  said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy shitstorm. </p> <p>I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2.

 <p><span>Straley, meanwhile, also believes that generative AI is here to stay, but </span><a href="https://x.com/bruce_straley/status/2001390353262457071?s=20"><span>says that he’s taken a stance against it</span></a><span> at Wildflower Interactive, though he admits that he might not be able to do so forever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We don’t need AI,” Straley said in an interview with </span><i><span>Kinda Funny</span></i><span>. “I really do think it’s the demise of the human species. Our brain…we need a frontal lobe. Hundreds of thousands of years of this supercomputer that’s built, and they’re making football fields and draining water supplies, etc. to try to replicate something that a human can already do. It just doesn’t make sense to me.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is AI needed in gaming?

Vávra says that “absolutely everyone else is” using generative AI in some capacity in game development, and if that’s true now, it doesn’t have to be. You can want better for your creative medium than plagiarizing slop machines that leave talented people out of work. If believing that bad things don’t have to happen is foolish, then I’d rather be a fool than an AI shill. </span></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Acclaimed LGBTQ+ developer Robert Yang has released another explicit game, this time a commentary on fishing for dates.</p>
<p>Rainbows Are Carnivores is a gay fishing and "aquaculture romance" game, in which a hunky fisherman fishes for nude men in the sea. Or, as Yang puts it in the <a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2025/12/rainbows.html">game's accompanying blog</a>, it's a game about "using your pole to catch some high quality hogs". Hog, incidentally, is angler slang for a big fish.</p>
<p>Yang has released plenty of controversial games, but is perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-yangs-the-tearoom-appeals-to-censors-by-swapping-cocks-for-glocks">best known for The Tearoom</a>: a commentary on '60s sodomy laws and video game censorship, in which men stand at urinals with guns for penises, while avoiding undercover cops.</p>

<p>Rainbows Are Carnivores instead includes full frontal male nudity. It's a <a href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/rainbows">free web-based game on itch.io</a>, with the "fisherman daddy" grading his catches until finding the perfect mate - though it doesn't quite work out how you might expect.</p>
<p>As well as a commentary on modern day dating, the game is a homoerotic play on male stereotypes, as well as criticism of overfishing. As Yang puts it: "There's never been fewer fish in the sea (so far)."</p>
<p>The game is also inspired by French film Stranger By The Lake (2013), which "artfully mixes sex and violence", explained Yang. Here, Yang portrays overfishing as its own type of violence.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a commentary on dating and romance in the app era," said Yang. "If we are the 'plenty of fish in the sea', we're also using technology to overfish ourselves - industrialising romance just like we've industrialised fishing, with diminishing returns. Dating pools enclosed by dating apps are like artificially abundant lakes where most relationships die off by the end of the season like farmed trout."</p>
<p>If you've ever attempted dating apps, you'll surely sympathise with that sentiment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Yang announced his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-controversial-and-explicit-projects-robert-yangs-next-game-is-a-sportslike-rugby-turn-based-rpg">forthcoming sports RPG Tryhard</a>. Set in New Zealand, players will manage an underdog rugby club, combining management sim elements and turn-based gameplay. Presumably, there'll be some sex too owing to Yang's oeuvre, though Tryhard is looking decidedly tamer than his previous work.</p>
