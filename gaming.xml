			<p>Just yesterday, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-top-publisher-december-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft ranked as the top games publisher in the world last month. And yet, their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q2/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second quarter, fiscal year 2025 financial report</a> doesn't exactly paint a rosy picture of the gaming division. Sure, CEO Satya Nadella boasted about a few records for Xbox Cloud Gaming, Game Pass, and successful games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>:</p>
<p><em>We are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and platform services. </em><em>And we are delivering on this plan.</em></p>
<p><em>Black Ops 6 was the top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter – and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history. </em><em>And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than 4 million people.</em></p>
<p><em>We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. </em><em>All-up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30%, as we focus on driving fully-paid subscribers across endpoints.</em></p>
<p>When you look closer at the numbers, though, overall Xbox content and services revenue increased only 2%, albeit Microsoft said that's above expectations thanks to higher-than-estimated performance from Activision Blizzard, chiefly Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The growth was this small because gaming revenue specifically was down 7%, dragged by the collapse of Xbox hardware revenue (-29%). Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood admitted in the earnings call:</p>
<p><em>In Gaming, revenue decreased 7% (8% in constant currency) as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines.</em></p>
<p>There is seemingly no end in sight for these Xbox hardware declines, which have been constant for several quarters now. Partly, it might even be due to Microsoft's own multiplatform strategy. Some gamers undoubtedly see no reason to purchase an Xbox when they can get their games not only on PC but also on PlayStation or Nintendo platforms. Microsoft certainly believes the switch toward multiplatform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> yet again by gaming CEO Phil Spencer just a few days ago, will be worth it in the end; for now, however, the struggles continue. Could this lead to the abandonment of Xbox hardware as a whole? At the time being, Microsoft still believes it can turn this around by making its hardware more alluring on its own rather than relying on exclusive games. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KK8xil5Uy0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Destin Legarie</a>, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I want us to innovate and make hardware the differentiator. We've got into this space where the differentiation on the hardware has gone down, and it's really been 'locked games' that have become the identity of the hardware. I love when I see handhelds, when I see unique things that hardware manufacturers do. I want our hardware to compete on power and on innovation. So let's have our platform continue to innovate with services and the hardware work that we're doing — whether it's controller, power, or mobility.</em></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review.1095675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa Evo is easily one of the most exciting racing games of 2025. The huge open-world map of German countryside surrounding the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife that developer Kunos Simulazioni is currently crafting for it should make it one of the biggest in the genre. Literally, that is. The map is going to be 1,600 square kilometres in size. That’s about 15 Forza Horizon 5s. However, we’ll need to be patient for that, as the first chunk of it isn’t set to arrive in Evo’s evolving early access version until mid-year, and then grow from there. For now, at least, we get five tracks and 20 cars to noodle around in. The good news is that the driving feel is unsurprisingly fabulous, right out of the gate. At this point, however, that’s… essentially it. It’s hard to argue Evo makes a strong case as an immediately <em>crucial </em>purchase in this early state if you’re not especially keen on taking some warm-up laps before the main event kicks off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’d be unfair to haul Assetto Corsa Evo over the coals too severely for its current technical blemishes. Yes, I’ve had it hitch up and drop frames occasionally and, yes, it’s crashed or frozen on me several times following its launch – although I’ve certainly had lengthy stints on-track where it’s been entirely cooperative on my current high-powered PC setup (RTX 4080, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H). Overall, it’s admittedly not running on all cylinders right now, but that’s the nature of ‘Early Access’ as a concept. We obviously need to be prepared for it to be a little more <em>Alpha</em> Romeo than Alfa Romeo at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while five circuits and 20 available cars is modest, it does make for a decent amount of combinations to experiment with – and that’s without factoring in the adjustable wet weather options that obviously have very real effects on handling. If you think you’ll be happy to simply hotlap solo around the initial tracks (which include Mount Panorama, Brands Hatch, Imola, Laguna Seca, and Suzuka), Evo’s early access version may keep you busy for at least a few days. It’s certainly worth remembering the early access program for Evo’s immediate predecessor, Assetto Corsa Competizione, launched with just <em>a single car and a single track</em> – the Lamborghini Huracan GT3 race car and the Nürburgring GP circuit. By comparison, Evo’s launch is at least a considerably chunkier one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first salvo of circuits includes a track from the US, Japan, the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Moreover, it’s a well-curated one. Notice, for instance, the first salvo of circuits includes a track from the US, Japan, the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. That’s a thoughtful mix that I don’t doubt was deliberate. Similarly, the short but sweet car list includes a spectrum of vehicles, ranging from front-wheel drive hatches to purpose-built race models. The feel of the cars I’ve tested so far has been top notch. I won’t pretend to be able to gauge the accuracy of the tyre model with the kind of insight you might glean from a professional racing driver, because I’m not one; I’m a car nerd journalist with a handful of trackdays in my past that I’m skeptical I’ll ever be able to afford to repeat. What I can say is the sensation of grip is excellent and I was instantly confident to push hard across the top of the mountain at Bathurst. Things always get a little murky when I’m comparing experiences gleaned many years ago using totally different racing setups (I personally migrated from a Thrustmaster TS-XW racing wheel to a direct drive Moza R12 some years ago), but Evo already seems to have nailed that feeling of being able to overdrive a car but still snap it back under control, because the grip will return as long as you wrestle it back into the window. That always suits me, as I’m a bit more of a butcher than a surgeon when it comes to racing sims these days. Forget the whole world turning into ice the second you slip into a slide; Evo is wonderfully intuitive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to ACC, race cars also feel a little less punishingly stiff and cling to the track more tenaciously, even while clattering over bumps or kerbs. In ACC, I generally felt like I was going as fast as I could without losing control. In Evo, I’ve found I feel like I <em>could </em>probably push faster. If I had the skill, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a really great feeling of balance, especially as cars squirm under braking, and the feel of the front end becoming lighter and heavier based on elevation changes is nice and pronounced. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, in the tradition of the original Assetto Corsa and ACC before it, Evo is already a genuinely terrific driving experience. But does that make this first taste a must-play?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, no. Not really. If you get it today you’re essentially just pre-ordering the final game at a slightly discounted price. That alone could be reason enough for you to grab it, and it’s a totally fair argument. However, other than confirming it feels good, there’s just not really much more joy to extract from Evo for the time being. As a man who peeled countless demo discs from the front of magazines back in ’90s, I’ve certainly got nothing against what’s essentially a hefty demo, but it’s not one I really want to keep playing anymore after seeing all of its tracks. But I’ll definitely be back for more when it’s available and some of the more annoying aspects have been resolved. </p><div id="rank-todays-top-racing-simulators" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank today's top racing simulators</h3><h3>Rank today's top racing simulators</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, the racing itself just isn’t that robust at the moment, and it’s tedious being punted off track by computer-controlled opponents who simply try to drive through you around corners. I don’t know what the answer is, but the AI certainly still needs work. There have definitely been times when other cars seemed to be deliberately giving me racing room, and others where they’ve made unscripted mistakes. That’s good, because it creates the illusion they’re not just machines. It’s also true that getting speared into from behind is an unfortunate reality in real racing. Incidents happen, sure. But it’d be something that would happen to you quite irregularly in reality, whereas it’s far too common in Evo for racing to remain fun. If I wanted to get rear-ended for kicks, I’d brake-check Lance Stroll in a drive-thru.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to get rear-ended for kicks, I’d brake-check Lance Stroll in a drive-thru.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a pretty big problem when these races are largely all Evo offers in its current condition. There were supposed to be some other modes available, based on what was announced when the early access version launched, but ever since I started playing Evo has been stuck in ‘Offline’ mode. Evo’s Driving Academy mode and Special Events are currently inaccessible to me. All I can do is generate custom practice or race sessions. Tying functionality to an always-online caveat is very concerning, and I cannot fathom why it’s necessary for single-player content. Fortunately, there’s still plenty of time for Kunos to tweak that on the road map ahead.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Assetto Corsa Evo already feels absolutely fantastic behind the wheel but, with aggravating AI opponents slamming into you every which way and hamstrung as it is by online-only features that are currently inaccessible, it doesn’t feel like an essential early access purchase. The handling may be excellent, but I’ll be parking it up and waiting for the finished product – including the promised epic-sized map of Germany – before I put the keys back in the ignition.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Tokyo Xtreme Racer Is Back After 20 (!!) Years, And It Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tokyo-xtreme-racer-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tokyo-xtreme-racer-is-back-after-20-years-and-it-rules.1095603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tokyo-xtreme-racer-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in the mid-90s, Japanese studio Genki were responsible for a series of games called <em>Shutokō Battle</em>, known (mostly) in the West as <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer</em>. From 1994-2006 these games landed on the Super Famicom, PlayStation, Saturn, Dreamcast, PS2, Xbox 360, PC and even portable systems, then they just...disappeared.</p><p>The last main game in the series came out in 2006, and that seemed a pretty fitting time for it to bow out. In the West we were well into the age of <em>Forza</em>, <em>Project Gotham</em> and <em>Burnout</em>, and <em>Tokyo Xtreme's</em> obsession with hard numbers and grinding--not to mention its relatively limited roster of cars and locations--made it seem almost quaint by comparison.</p><p>But hey, times change! We're now in 2025, we're exhausted with AAA racing games, we're tired of the same old franchises doing the same old things, and it's time for something new! And by something new I mean something very old, because here comes a new <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer </em>game like nothing happened.</p><p>Look at this series’ release timeline. This is the video game equivalent of a cat going missing for nine years then just walking back into your house like nothing happened. Only instead of nine years it's <em>19</em>. And instead of walking, the cat drifted in sideways like a sick, modified Subaru Impreza.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Wikipedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is great! This new game is, I'm told, largely unchanged in terms of structure from its decades-old predecessors; you drive around Japanese motorways challenging people to races, which are decided not by clocks or flags, but by a "spirit meter" that drains if you're behind your opponent. There's also loads of grinding and tinkering to do in order to level up your car and be able to defeat more powerful rivals. About the only thing that's changed significantly is that it looks nicer.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【Tokyo Xtreme Racer】#8：Full PV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umlztIQ7HeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which is fine, because going back to the well is maybe my favourite broad trend in video games right now.<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> AAA gaming has gotten so risk averse, and its release calendar has become so sparse</a>, that these mid-tier kinds of games--once beloved by millions, but crowded out over the past decade by an industry that thought it was moving past them--are coming back.</p><p>Turns out we weren't moving past anything. We <em>thought </em>we were, but all we've ended up doing over the past two decades is see racing games--like so many other genres--become bloated beyond almost all recognition as they've chased realism, more cars, more features, bigger tracks, more, more more. Or, on the flipside, they've retreated the other direction and become incredibly simple, casual affairs (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like the excellent <em>Art of Rally</em>!</a>)</p><p><em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer</em> (2025), then, is a welcome reminder that for many people racing video games were at their best when they were somewhere in between; when they were just video games about racing cars, not swollen attempts at simulating the act of driving. This is a game about menus, about tinkering with engine values, unlocking old Nissans and just driving around to have some fun. It's returning at a time when we've learned to appreciate that maybe we never had to move past these kinds of games at all.</p><p>Time now to confess that I'm a newcomer to the series, and one thing I love from playing this new release is the 1v1 aspect of the game. <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer </em>works by just letting you drive around the motorway until you find a rival, then when you want to challenge them, you flash your headlights a couple of times and a race triggers.</p><figure><figcaption>Pictured: me coming up on my next opponent</figcaption></figure><p>You're supposed to challenge other drivers in fancy sports cars, who are clearly noted on the map as rivals, but turns out you can also just challenge <em>anyone </em>driving on the motorway. Guy driving a Dyna work truck? You can race them. Someone behind the wheel of a little Suzuki? Take them on. You don't get many points (needed to upgrade your car and buy stuff) for doing so, but it's <em>incredibly </em>funny the first 90-100 times you do it.</p><figure></figure><p>Being new, I was also unaware that the game, which mostly takes place with a very racing game tone and presentation, also has intros like this? I'm driving a Mazda on a motorway, but this looks like the intro to a game about mystical ninjas on PS2?

While sales numbers are hard to pin down given its availability on Xbox Game Pass, 4 million is still an impressive number of players considering not many people knew exactly what to expect in a modern, AAA Indiana Jones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved it ourselves, calling it an "irrestistable and immersive global treasure hunt," along with nominations for Game of the Year and Best Xbox game. You can read our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">full review here</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in Xbox land, Microsoft confirmed that Game Pass PC grew 30%  last quarter and set a new quarterly revenue record. On the cloud gaming side, 140 million hours of streaming has been logged. All this helped Xbox content and service revenue grow 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still work to be done however. While the Game Pass figures were stronger than expected, overall gaming revenue declined 7% and Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean? Well, Microsoft still has ground to make up in the console and hardware space, but its continued investment into Game Pass appears to be paying off. Game Pass growth on PC makes sense given Xbox had a slate of big game releases last quarter that includes Indiana Jones but also Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Microsoft Flight Simulator. All of which were available on Game Pass day one for Ultimate subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to developer Hello Games, the update will introduce “billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets.”</p><p>The update is called <em>Worlds Part II</em>; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1">it follows <em>Worlds Part I </em>from last year</a>, which made the game’s planets more detailed and realistic. In addition to increasing the sheer scale of planets and systems available to explore, the new update also adds more biomes and terrain types. Here are some of the highlights, via Hello Games cofounder Sean Murray:</p><div><ul><li><span>“Terrain is more detailed and far more varied with huge mountains and these massive features.”</span></li><li><span>“Gas giants are truly epic, ten times bigger than our biggest planet. It’s truly end-game stuff to explore them with huge storms that rage across the surface.”</span></li><li><span>“New tech allows oceans that can be several kilometers deep. A new lighting system makes them look so different. New caustics, light shafts and the deeper that you explore the darker it gets.”</span></li></ul></div><p>There are also new alien creatures, about which Murray says, “I think we’ve gone probably weirder than ever before.” <em>Worlds Part II</em> sounds like it would be a huge update for any release, let alone one that’s approaching its 10th anniversary. As with all of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s many previous updates, it will be free for all players — and you can download it today. Check out the full patch notes <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update">right here</a>.</p><p>According to Murray, some of these features come from tech that was created for the studio’s next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990841/hello-games-light-no-fire-trailer">the fantasy adventure <em>Light No Fire</em></a>. “The team is extremely busy on <em>Light No Fire</em>,” he explains. “Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 having Early Access would go a long way to shortening the seven-year wait for a sequel. The first game was a blockbuster success and has kept fans entertained for years. The time has come for a new title though, but you want to know if you can play it early, and we know.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios believes in the “bigger is better ideology.” The sequel is bigger, the development team working on the game is bigger, and it has a bigger weapon pool. It’s just <em>bigger</em>. The first game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 8 million units</a>, so it’s obvious the interest is there—hence the Early Access discussion.</p>



<p>Early Access is all the rage. Everyone wants everything now. Let’s see if you can have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-early-access">Can You Play Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ll have to pass on that drink for now. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn’t feature any form of Early Access, meaning the only way to play KC2 is to wait for the worldwide launch.</strong></p>



<p>Warhorse Studios hasn’t commented on Early Access, which isn’t ideal. Worse still, we’ve seen every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 edition, and while they come with a whole host of luxurious benefits for launch and after KC2’s release, <strong>there’s no Early Access</strong>.</p>



<p>Why is this? I don’t know. There does seem to be a trend of games with close communities and titles geared toward players (and not microtransactions) foregoing modern-day business practices—Early Access being one. The developer has opted not to have Early Access, and potentially use the benefit as a way to flog more expensive editions.</p>



<p>Lots of this is speculation on my part. However, one thing not up for debate is there is no Early Access.  </p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Editions</h2>



<p><strong>There is a Standard Edition, Gold Edition, and Collector’s Edition for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 if you want more out of the experience.</strong></p>



<p>Each one ramps up the price, but also the content included. To iterate, none of them have Early Access. But you can check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions-collectors-edition-gold-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 edition</a> to see if any catch your eye. </p>



<p>Plus, securing your copy early is a surefire way to guarantee the inviting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions-collectors-edition-gold-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonus</a> too.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m sorry if you were hoping for better news. At least it isn’t long now until the February 4 release date, and you can make the Kingdom of Bohemia your own. Let us know the first thing you’re going to do in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 in the comments below.</p>



<p>We’ve answered many other questions about the sequel too including if it’s coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-coming-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how big the map is</a>, and what the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-launch roadmap</a> plans are looking like.</p>

                <p>There's an ongoing debate as to whether Microsoft's Game Pass hurts or helps sales of titles that are available on the service. But as far as id Software co-founder and Doom co-creator John Romero is concerned, Game Pass is beneficial to the video game industry.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/doom-creator-loves-xbox-game-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a>, Romero was recently interviewed by <a href="https://youtu.be/sBOMxyuyQeQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Expansion Pass</a>, and he was effusive with his praise for Game Pass.</p><p>"I love it," said Romero. "I mean, who doesn't love Game Pass? It's Netflix for games; who doesn't want that? It's great because it's try before you buy... one thing after another thing. Really the barrier for people to play games is just access to those games. Even free-to-play games, it's like, knowing that those games exist, and Game Pass is like 'Here they are!'"</p><p>Romero went on to add that Game Pass "doesn't hurt the game companies that made those games," because players get to experience titles more quickly even if they don't keep them. It's unclear if Romero feels this way even about games that launch on Game Pass at the same time that they hit stores. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> was seemingly unaffected by its availability on Game Pass, and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">the top-selling game in America for 2024</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> only debuted at No. 14 on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/indiana-jones-enters-the-20-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-december-but-black-ops-6-is-still-no-1/2900-6157/" data-ref-id="2900-6157">December 2024's list of best-selling games</a>. That game may have also been hampered by the fact that its PlayStation 5 port won't arrive until later this spring.</p><p>Although Romero didn't work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, that title will be a day-one release on Game Pass when it arrives on May 15. And unlike Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it will also be hitting PlayStation 5 at the same time as its debut on Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-new-approach-to-starting-weapons-and-hope-series-gear-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Hope set proves that you're a chosen hunter.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ask players what gets them excited about the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, some will surely bring up making new equipment utilizing materials gathered on their hunts. Just about every hunter has felt the joy of completing a head-to-toe armor set with a matching weapon after hunting the same monster again and again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Equipment in the Monster Hunter series has followed a certain concept ever since its earliest games: Beat the monsters and take on their power through equipment crafted from their remains. Players rely on their own strength to slay powerful monsters, then make those monsters' abilities their own to grow even stronger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, Monster Hunter Wilds Executive Director and Art Director Kaname Fujioka explains the concept behind Monster Hunter's equipment. "While the range of our designs has now grown broader, we used to be very conscious of the kind of idea that if you're wearing Rathalos' equipment, you'll look like Rathalos." This new title sees new monsters as well, each bringing its own colorful equipment. For example, Rompopolo, a monster whose design is meant to evoke a mad scientist, has a unique piece of head armor that looks like a plague doctor's mask. You can see the armor set in the hunt video below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But among all of these distinctive sets of monster equipment, the developers say they want players to pay special attention to the various pieces of starting equipment that your hunter begins the game wearing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I designed the starting weapons for all 14 weapon types from scratch,” says Fujioka. “That's the first time I've done this, as far as I can remember. Until now, players would begin the game as a new hunter, and so they would tend to start with truly primitive and simple weapons. But as the protagonist is a chosen hunter in this game, it actually wouldn't feel right for them to be carrying a plain weapon. I wanted to make it feel like you're a bit of a star, even when you're only carrying starting equipment."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/artwork-hope-01-1738182813355.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hope armor and weapon concept art. Courtesy Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda adds, “Incidentally, weapon designs in Monster Hunter: World generally retained a certain form, but they featured a customized appearance based on which monster materials were used. However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-monster-hunter-wilds-every-weapon-has-its-own-unique-design-ign-first">in Wilds, each weapon has its own unique design.</a>”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These starting weapons are designed in order to reflect the story that you are an experienced hunter, selected to investigate the Forbidden Lands. Tokuda adds that the starting armor is also full of attention to detail on the part of the creators so that it matches the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The starting armor for this game is called the Hope series,” he says. “The design looks incredibly cool, to the point where I think you could even use it until the very end and it wouldn't feel out of place."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/artwork-hope-02-1738182817211.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hope armor concept art. Courtesy Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With its deep emerald green base color, the Hope set turns into an outfit with a hooded long coat once completed. Fujioka explains that constructing the set wasn't simple, with each part standing alone while also coming together to create a full ensemble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've actually given more attention to the Hope series than any other equipment in this game,” he says. “Previous games in the series have had separate upper-body and lower-body armor, and we couldn't actually depict them coming together to create something like a coat. We just had to make each piece its own part due to gameplay design and how the game managed it, but I wanted to see if we could make a single flowing hooded coat. We made that happen in this game by investing a lot of in-game resources into it. Of course, players will find lots of different pieces of equipment as they proceed through the game, and we do also want them to keep trying out one new weapon after the next. That's why we attempted to make the Hope series one that doesn't stand out too much but still has a sense of elegant coolness."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a luxury to be able to start a game with equipment that creators have put so much effort and thought into. These 14 starting weapons and the Hope series have been carefully made to look like the kind of equipment that an impressive star hunter would wear. We're excited to take a close look at all their detail in the finished game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on February 28.

Though we’ve seen a handful of weapons from Wilds, we haven’t seen quite enough to make a determinative verdict on our own about their general design philosophy–but now, Monster Hunter Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda has cleared up this question. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When speaking about the Hope series armor and weapons, Tokuda told us: “Incidentally, weapon designs in Monster Hunter: World generally retained a certain form, but they featured a customized appearance based on which monster materials were used. However, in Wilds, each weapon has its own unique design.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The direct comparison to how weapon designs were in Monster Hunter: World answers the question clearly–we don’t have to worry about weapons looking too similar to each other in Monster Hunter Wilds. And though some weapons in Monster Hunter: World eventually upgraded to the point of being entirely unique, many lines weren’t so lucky. You can see in the image below just how similar the final aqua line Sword and Shield is to the final Pukei-Pukei sword and shield, and how similar the final bone line long sword is to the final Jyuratodus long sword, for example. These were the most upgraded versions of these weapons when Monster Hunter: World first released. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/monster-hunter-world-weapons-1738181673291.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">From Monster Hunter World, captured on the PS4. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare those to the designs we’ve seen in Monster Hunter Wilds so far in the slideshow below.

                <p>Dead Space has seen a number of spin-off novels and comics, but most of them have been out of print for years. It was announced in 2024 that reprints would be arriving soon--and we’re quickly approaching their arrival. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dead Space Vol. 1</a> releases on March 11, marking its first reprint since 2013.

You can read more about all the upcoming Dead Space books and graphic novels below, along with links to preorder. Note that reserving preorders through Amazon means you won’t pay until the items ship. If prices drop between now and release, you’ll also only be on the hook for the lower price. </p><div title="6529104 - Dead Space Novels and Graphic Novels Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3116" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529104 - Dead Space Novels and Graphic Novels Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Dead Space Vol. 1</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$18 | Releases March 11</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The first graphic novel in the series follows P-SEC Sgt.

With just a day to go until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> swings onto PC, Sony has shared details of its platform-enhanced features, as well as the hardware required to run it.
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-marvels-spider-man-2-on-ps5-pro-upgrading-insomniacs-masterpiece">called</a> Marvel's Spider-Man 2 a "new showcase" for visual detail and ray tracing when it released for PS5 in 2023, and its new PC version - ported by the Sony-owned Nixxes - is looking to build on that with a range of platform-focused additions.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC blog post</a>, for instance, Sony highlights, "new raytracing options with individual quality settings to finetune performance and fidelity across a broad range of hardware configurations". There's also talk of settings for raytraced interiors, shadows, and ambient occlusion - adding what Sony calls "an additional layer of believability with realistic shadows and increased depth to the game".

<p>
Players with beefy enough hardware can additionally take advantage of an increased raytracing geometry detail setting, which enables higher quality meshes for raytracing. There's also an object range slider, enabling users to manually adjust the range at which objects are considered for raytracing, as well support for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLSS 3 and FSR 3.1 for upscaling and frame generation. Additionally, PC players who like their monitors <em>long</em> get ultra-wide support, at ratios including 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9.
</p><p>
All of which brings us to Marvel's Spider-Man 2's PC system requirements, with Sony's minimum specification targeting 720p at 30fps on Very Low settings. Those with considerably more powerful hardware (which is to say, an RTX 4090 and i9-12900K/Ryzen 7 7800X3D) can aim for 60fps at 4K resolutions, using Very High Ray Tracing Ultimate settings. Full recommended PC specs can be found below.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 releases for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-2">Epic</a> on Thursday, 30th January - and as we recently learned, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">won't require a PSN account to play</a> after all.

            <p>
Amid reports of potential layoffs at BioWare, studio general manager Gary McKay has confirmed "many" employees have now been moved elsewhere in EA following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - and that a remaining core team, which includes a number of now-confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veterans, is fully focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">statement shared on BioWare's website</a>, McKay said the studio was currently "preparing for [its] next chapter", with a "core team" lead by Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley now working on the next Mass Effect. However (reflecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">comments made by former studio veteran Mark Darrah</a> last week), McKay said the project is still at a stage that doesn't "require support from the full studio".
</p>
<p>
As a result, BioWare has downsized to what McKay calls a "more agile, focused studio". And while no specific numbers were shared, the move appears to have impacted a substantial number of staff, with McKay saying BioWare has been working to "match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."

<p>
However, while McKay's statement dances around any mention of layoffs, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">reports</a> a second group of BioWare employees also had their roles terminated but weren't placed in new positions - EA instead giving them time to apply for new jobs within the company if they wanted to. The publisher failed to provide much clarity in a follow-up statement to IGN, saying it would not be "sharing numbers", but that BioWare now "has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development."
</p><p>
Today's BioWare studio update comes a week after what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">appeared to be Dragon Age: The Veilguard's final patch</a>, and follows EA's recent admission the fantasy RPG had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">generated lower-than-expected interest</a>. Mass Effect 5 (or whatever it's eventually named) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-says-a-brand-new-mass-effect-game-is-in-development">confirmed to be in the "early stages" of development</a> back in 2020.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/bioware-is-downsizing-mass-effect-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>BioWare Gnereal Manager Gary McKay has confirmed that the studio has been “downsizing” following the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> last year and prior to spinning up full development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mass-effect-4">the next Mass Effect game</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-production on a game typically requires a smaller core team, and McKay states that “[BioWare] are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare. […] Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio.”</p>


<p>That’s seemingly coded phrasing for job losses, though he does assert that “over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles”. Hopefully job losses alongside that have actually been minimal, and we hope anyone affected is able to find new work soon.</p>
<p>This is a sign of where the new Mass Effect game is at, and an indication that it will be several years away from release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/08/mass-effect-4-teaser-marks-the-return-of-an-old-enemy/">Having been teased back in 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/07/bioware-tease-next-mass-effect-game-with-a-new-image/">and again in 2022</a>, we’ve known for years that a team led by Mike Gamble is in pre-production on the next game. We might have hoped that this would allow for production to scale up following Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s release, but it seems BioWare isn’t quite there yet.</p>
<p>While well received by critics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed EA’s expectations</a>, leading to a cut in financial forecasts – EA Sports FC 25 had a bigger share of the blame, to be fair. Additionally, BioWare released what seems to be <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">the last major update for Veilguard last week</a>, winding down active support to only bug fixes for game-breaking issues.</p>

<p>Here’s the statement from Gary McKay:</p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare’s story. As we announced in <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/">August 2023</a>, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team at BioWare is developing the next Mass Effect game under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, and others.</p>
<p>In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.</p>
<p>Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio. We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.</p>
<p>Today’s news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare.</p>
<p><em>Gary McKay</em></p>

                <p>With its release coming in just one day, Insomniac Games and Nixxes have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> the PC requirements for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The specs do not require for a ray-tracing-compatible GPU, as has been the case with some recent and upcoming games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-revealed-requires-ray-tracing-compatible-gpu/1100-6528993/" data-ref-id="1100-6528993">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-run-on-your-pc-check-out-the-requirements/1100-6528208/" data-ref-id="1100-6528208">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p><p>Insomniac provided six different preset levels, three without ray tracing and three without. Those with beefier PCs can enable ray tracing for more realistic reflections. A slider allows you to adjust the range at which objects are considered for ray tracing reflections. If you're hoping to play on more modest hardware, the low end--which is for Very Low graphics settings and 720p resolution at 30fps--only calls for a GTX 1650 or RX 5500 XT. There's no word on Steam Deck compatibility as of yet.</p><p>The game supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation. Intel XeSS upscaling is supported too. Ultra-wide monitor support includes 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/601473/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-gpu-preorder-buy-price-release-date-availability-founders-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While Nvidia’s RTX 50-series graphics cards weren’t the zaniest devices at CES 2025, they stole the show with their promised groundbreaking performance breakthroughs. The RTX 5070, in particular, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">made headlines as a card that can supposedly rival an RTX 4090 for just $549</a>. We later learned it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4’s AI-powered multi frame generation</a> to achieve that in supported titles, but that’s a welcome compromise for those who can’t find room in their budget for the beefier 4K-ready GPUs that are going up for sale at 9AM ET on January 30th — including the $999.99 RTX 5080 and the $1,999.99 RTX 5090.</p><p>Those premium cards are capable of greater raw performance, however. In our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080 review</a>, we found it’s only about 15 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23457556/nvidia-rtx-4080-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test-review">RTX 4080</a> it’s replacing. Meanwhile, the benchmarks we ran for our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 review</a> averaged 28 percent better frame rates compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 4090</a> for 4K games running at their highest settings with no frame generation help. That’s still impressive given the Founder’s Edition is small enough that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">fit inside a small form factor PC case</a>. No matter which you’re after, you’ll be exceedingly satisfied if you’re upgrading from an RTX 30-series card or older.</p><p>Between resellers and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/598793/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-low-stock-warning">forewarned scarcity</a> that’s soured past launches, you’ll likely need a good game plan to secure a 50-series GPU early on. If you aren’t already in line at a brick-and-mortar location, it might be a little too late to find day one stock based on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1iaunns/campers_already_appeared/">encampments that have spawned</a> over the past several days, but we’ll show you where to preorder one online when they become available tomorrow morning.</p><div><h2>Tips to increase your chances</h2><section><p>It’s typically faster to use a desktop or a laptop to click around and input whatever information you need. If you can, use a computer with an ethernet connection to ensure nothing interferes with your network. Bonus points if you use an ultrawide or multiple monitors to view several browser windows at once.</p></section><section><p>Some retailers may implement a wait queue. You can use your smartphone, tablet, or another secondary device to try and get a faster queue time. It can also serve as a failsafe between refreshes if one of the sites slows to a crawl on your desktop. That said, your smartphone should only be a last result to using a PC, as you don’t want to waste time juggling multiple tabs and apps or tapping away at tiny input fields.</p></section><section><p>The last thing you’ll want to be doing when the floodgates open on January 30th is fiddling with passwords and a deluge of confirmation emails. Make sure you have an account with each retailer that’s expected to carry the graphics cards, and do so ahead of launch.</p></section><section><p>If possible, you’ll also want to add your shipping and billing details in advance. This way, you’ll only have to worry about adding the GPU to your cart and completing the final checkout steps.</p></section><section><p>Both Best Buy and Nvidia allow you to sign up to be notified when the GPUs become available. B&amp;H Photo actually requires you to sign up in advance if you want to order one. Be sure to sign up for alerts on each variant of the 5080 or 5090 that you’re planning to buy.</p></section><section><p>You don’t want to rely solely on email notifications for stock alerts, as they’re often delayed and you risk missing your chance. Be sure to load up tabs for each retailer shortly before their listings go live, and then practice hitting that refresh button as fast as humanely possible.</p></section></div><div><p id="where-to-preorder-the-nvidia-rtx-5080-and-rtx-5090"><h2>Where to preorder the Nvidia RTX 5080 and RTX 5090</h2></p></div><p>As of writing, we’re only seeing retail listings for the Founders Editions of the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 at Best Buy, and you can expect Nvidia to sell them, too. That said, there are multiple options from a variety of manufacturers across all retailers, including MSI, Asus, Gigabyte, Zotac, and more. Keep reading for details on each retailer’s current plans.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is the successor to the RTX 4080.

Eventually, a range of laptops and pre-built desktop PCs with the GPUs will become available. The retailer currently allows you to sign up to be notified about their arrival, but you’ll want to be proactive and check the site listings early and often on the morning of January 30th.</p><p>Purchasing a 50-series graphics card from Best Buy requires creating an account. If you’re lucky enough to add one to cart, you’ll be added to a queue while the system verifies your account and confirms your unit. If successful, you’ll have 10 minutes to complete the checkout process.</p><div><p id="newegg"><h3>Newegg</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FRTX-50-Series%2FEventSaleStore%2FID-1473" rel="sponsored">Newegg is teasing a comprehensive stock</a> of 50-series graphics cards.
