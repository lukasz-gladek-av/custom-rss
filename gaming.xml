<p>Part of the ship, part of the crew</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hello Games is introducing the first major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> update since the game launched on Switch 2, and it looks like a cool one.</p>
<p>The big new addition in the 'Voyagers' update is the chance to design and build your very own spaceship. These ships ('Corvettes') can be as big or as small as you'd like, with real interiors packing in med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters and more for you to waltz around even mid-flight.</p>
<p>To really hammer home the space captain vibes, you can bring aboard friends as your crew, letting them help with designs and travel across the universe with you. What's more, you can pop the hatch on your Corvette and head out for a space walk, gliding around your rig or hopping to another nearby ship.</p>
<p>For design inspiration purposes, here's a closer look at some of these Corvettes in action:</p>

<p>With so many additional moving parts (spaceships being redesigned while planets are rendered in the distance is no small task), we'll be interested to see how the little Switch version holds up. Fortunately, the beefier Switch 2 edition — which we described as "an almost-perfect match for other versions of the game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — should offer a smoother ride.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-weird-demo.1281708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Xbox PR reached out about a digital preview for The Outer Worlds 2, I literally beamed at the opportunity. They had done exactly the same for Avowed a couple of months ahead of that Obsidian RPG's launch, and that demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did a lot to get me even more hyped for the final game</a>. It was an extensive demo that provided more or less free rein to roam Avowed's first region of Dawnshore, explore it, and get a proper taste of what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full game would be all about</a>. It also included companions, who are always a big part of Obsidian's roleplaying games, as fans of the Irvine-based studio know all too well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the demo that was shared for The Outer Worlds 2 is much more limited. It starts at what appears to be the very beginning of the game; in that regard, it's akin to Avowed. However, whereas the latter game's demo went much further than the tutorial mission, this one does not. I learned afterward that it was the same demo available at Gamescom 2025, and it would have made sense there given the one-hour slot limit, but for a digital preview, it is a thorough disappointment. </p>



<p>The demo doesn't even provide access to companions, so you're completely on your own for the mission. Moreover, it does not include any explorable zone like the aforementioned Dawnshore from Avowed. This <span>straightforward mission doesn't really showcase the '<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-has-way-more-expansive-worlds-filled-with-fun-stories-and-cool-stuff-to-find-says-obsidian/" target="_blank">much more expansive worlds</a>' touted by the developer in recent The Outer Worlds 2 media blasts, or the many new cool gadgets&nbsp;</span>showcased in previous videos.</p>



<p>Sure, there were a couple of different paths to take while going through the mission. You can, for example, use the Eloquence skill (provided that you've picked it up when creating your character) to convince an NPC to disable the automated security and get you into the facility without having to fight the robots. You can also use other skills like Hacking or Engineering or Lockpicking to unlock specific doors. But all those features were already in the first The Outer Worlds game. I hoped to get a peek at what's new and improved, but this build didn't have much of that.</p>



<p>It did have the option to play in third-person view, which was completely absent from the previous installment. You will have to select it from the game's options, and there are two choices: a close third-person camera and a far one. Honestly, though, just like with Avowed, I believe they are there more for accessibility reasons than a genuine alternative. It's fine if you just cannot stomach first-person due to health concerns like motion sickness, but otherwise, you're much better off with first-person; the animations do not look nearly as good in third-person.</p>



<p>Another thing that Obsidian said it improved in The Outer Worlds 2 is the shooting part, which was refined based on feedback from Halo Studios and the analysis of Bungie's Destiny. The improvements are definitely there; shooting feels more solid, but still not quite as good as a top-notch shooter. Melee combat, unfortunately, still doesn't appear to be as in-depth as Avowed, and the lack of a dodge button certainly does not help.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The combat gameplay relies heavily on the 'Tactical Time Dilation' device (which also returns from the original title). This device allows the player to slow down time, which is essential if you want to survive against multiple foes at higher difficulty levels. The sequel does add destructible cover, but again, this was not featured in the demo build.</p>



<p>Lastly, from a technical standpoint, The Outer Worlds 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Unreal Engine 4. The visual improvement compared to the original is noticeable but perhaps slightly less significant than I would have hoped, even with ray traced lighting, shadows, and reflections enabled. The game also already supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, although the implementation might still need some tweaking. </p>



<p>On PC, the graphics settings already offer plenty of options for users to tinker with, including a built-in frame rate limiter, five upscaling options (TAA, TSR, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA DLSS, the only one to support Frame Generation), a slider for Field of View, and a toggle for Chromatic Aberration. On my RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the demo ran smoothly without any stuttering, but like I said, it was a small level. The real test will be on those larger open-ended areas. Given that the game will launch simultaneously on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles, I hoped to see support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and/or adaptive triggers, but there seems to be only regular rumble.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite the fairly disappointed tone of this preview, I am still confident that Obsidian will deliver a meaty, fun, and enjoyable roleplaying game with The Outer Worlds 2. It's just that the demo they provided did not give us much of an opportunity to discover its new features and improvements.</p>



<p>Still, the full game is just two months away from being released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Look forward to our review ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned October 29 launch</a>. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-ubisoft-revival-five-classic-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-to-revive-five-classic-ubisoft-games-after-acquiring-rights.1281705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it has acquired the intellectual property rights to five classic Ubisoft games, and that it will revive all of them on newer platforms with "renewed publishing frameworks".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Atari reveals that the five&nbsp;Ubisoft titles in question are as follows:&nbsp;<em>Cold Fear</em>,&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grow Home</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Grow Up</em>. All five will be re-released on "new platforms", according to Atari.</p>

<p>It's likely that the company is referring specifically to current-gen consoles, given that technically speaking, four of the five games in this list (with&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden&nbsp;</em>being the only exception)&nbsp;are still available on PC via Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/i-am-alive-ubisoft-atari-revival.jpg?itok=GxeB1ktm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/i-am-alive-ubisoft-atari-revival.jpg?itok=bZQURLhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2012's survival game&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive&nbsp;</em>is just one of five Ubisoft titles Atari plans to revive.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Atari, the plan is to re-release all five of these games under its own publishing label, as well as to "explore opportunities" to expand the reach of the games "through updated formats, new content, and extended distribution channels".</p>

<p>Hopefully, this means that the five games in the list will be getting remastered versions; they're all arguably in need of them to varying degrees, with 2005's&nbsp;<em>Cold Fear&nbsp;</em>being a particularly strong candidate for an updated re-release.</p>

<p>Still, being able to play <i>Cold Fear</i>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden&nbsp;</em>on modern consoles will be nice. Technically, both&nbsp;<em>Grow Home&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grow Up&nbsp;</em>are already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>This news comes after a particularly difficult year for Ubisoft. Not only did its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">first-quarter financials back in July</a> disappoint, but last fiscal year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">was a grim one for sales</a>, with a strong performance from&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>failing to make up for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shortfalls elsewhere</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-combat-yasuke.jpg?itok=iI4ryqrf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-combat-yasuke.jpg?itok=IjRjxXkS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>hasn't been able to make up for a bad year for Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Atari, the legendary gaming studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-thunderful-majority-stake" rel="nofollow">purchased a majority stake</a> in&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>publisher Thunderful last month, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition" rel="nofollow">acquiring long-time rival Intellivision</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">bringing back the iconic label Infogrames</a>&nbsp;last year.</p>

            <p>Have you ever wanted to swim out of a spaceship's backside while it sits in orbit, the sound of two dear friends arguing over whether it really needs a fifth teleporter room not seeping with you into the inky blackness? You know, because space is a famously scream-free zone. Well, the latest in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s endless string of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-latest-big-update-that-is-somehow-also-free-will-let-you-become-a-mayor-of-all-things">free</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-has-a-mass-effect-normandy-again-together-with-new-cross-save-functionality">updates</a> has you covered. It's called Voyagers, and adds in custom multi-person ships dubbed corvettes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These ships are yours to design and build to your liking, with the addition of some sleeping quarters and a mission radar all you need to get started and welcome a crew of friends aboard to accompany you on your adventures. "These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters," said Hello Games boss Sean Murray. "It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</p>
<p>Murray adds that corvettes, which you can naturally also tape the likes of extra guns and windows to, are "encountered a little way into the game" and can be unlocked "reasonably swiftly" by spacers who've already sunk plenty of hours into the quest for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">spacevival</a>. The Voyagers update relies on tech which Hello say has been developed with an eye to their next game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, which as an open-world thing on an Earth-sized planet with Earth-sized oceans, will feature large boats and crews of its own.</p>

<p>Naturally, that's no easy feat, with Murray revealing: "Almost every part of the game has had to be reworked to accommodate these relative spaces. Having your multiplayer crew walking around, calmly editing your ship, as it travels at warp speeds towards a planet that is being generated as you approach. It's pretty insane what's going on behind the scenes to make that work."</p><p>Cool, but also, I'm looking at this very being-in-a-ship-centric update and can't help being drawn to an aspect of it that doesn't technically involve being in a ship. You see, if you park multiple corvettes in orbit around a planet, you can spacewalk or skydive between them. In practice, your space-suited little fella's gently spat out of the back entrance to your craft, like... Well, I'll refrain from describing it in the manner I'd typically employ, since the RPS treehouse has a bit more decorum than some of the other places I've hung out. Suffice it to say that mucking about pinging between ships and diving down towards the surface looks like great fun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a fresh wave of reinforcements in the fight to spread democracy following the Xbox release, and there’s a host of Warbonds available to purchase.</p>



<p>Warbonds are regularly released in Helldivers 2, with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils Premium Warbond</a> on the horizon, which can make it difficult to decide which to pick up. Fortunately for you, we’re here to help.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to spend your Premium Warbond Token or are mulling over splashing some extra cash on more unlocks, we’ve got a breakdown of the best Warbonds available in Helldivers 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-best-warbonds-listed">Helldivers 2 Best Warbonds, Listed</h2>



<h3 id="h-democratic-detonation">Democratic Detonation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>For democracy! Image via Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>For those just starting out in Helldivers 2 and looking to give their arsenal a boost, there isn’t much better than the Democratic Detonation. With three pages of rewards, you’ll receive useful weapons, armor, and an armor passive, along with the usual cosmetics.</p>



<p>The G-123 Thermite grenade is great for taking out Terminid enemies, while both the Grenade Pistol and Exploding Crossbow can also be used to take out swarms of enemies. Just beware you don’t also take out the rest of your squad.</p>



<p>Add in some nice cosmetics and a return of 100 Super Credits, and it’s the ideal starting point.</p>



<h3 id="h-cutting-edge">Cutting Edge</h3>



<p>Initially one of the weakest Warbonds in the game, the benefit of the Cutting Edge Warbond has increased significantly following the introduction of the Illuminate to the game.</p>



<p>The Arc Resistance Passive is the perfect counter to the Illuminate, offering a huge amount of damage reduction. If you’re struggling to overcome that specific enemy time, take a look at this option.</p>



<p>Also in the Warbond are Stun Grenades, the Sickle Assault Rifle, and the Blitzer Shotgun, with both weapons having infinite ammo.</p>







<p>The biggest addition from the Urban Legends Warbond is the Anti-Tank Emplacement, the perfect tool to take out Strider Convoys and large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>With the Siege-Ready passive, you will benefit from quicker reload speeds and the ability to carry 20% additional ammunition, which is a boost for any combat situation.</p>



<p>There’s also a Stun Lance, a Flame Sentry, and a Directional Shield which, although not as stong as other options, can still come in useful.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-odst-legendary-warbond">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>Not only is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a> stocked full of unlocks that will release a wave of nostalgia, it also marks the historic moment of Helldivers 2’s Xbox release—the first Sony title to make the jump to the rival platform.</p>



<p>With four new weapons, two armors, a new armor passive, and a bunch of other cosmetic items, the Halo ODST Legendary Warbond is a solid pick-up for those looking to expand their collection with exclusive items. </p>



<p>The downside, however, is that you can’t use a Premium Warbond Token to unlock this, so you will have to splash out some extra cash. </p>



<h3 id="h-servants-of-freedom">Servants of Freedom</h3>



<p>Those looking for the ultimate weapon should look no further than the Portable Hellbomb, the perfect tool to issue damage to a large area or to clear out an objective.</p>



<p>The Ultimatum sidearm can also clear out huge groups of enemies, with huge explosive damage that is on par with an Orbital Precision Strike.</p>



<p>If that’s not enough, the Double-Edged Sickler has a larger heat sink than the original and increased damage penetration the longer you fire, though the downside is you could catch alight too.</p>



<h3 id="h-truth-enforcers">Truth Enforcers</h3>



<p>Any players who prefer their combat to be up close and personal should head straight to the Truth Enforcers Warbond, which features some of the strongest close-range weapons in the game.</p>



<p>The SMG-32 Reprimand Heavy and the SG-20 Halt Shotgun are the two guns in question, the latter being able to switch between armor-piercing ammo and stun rounds, giving you more versatility in the field.</p>



<p>Capping things off is the PLAS-15 Loyalist Plasma Pistol, a decent sidearm option if you’re looking for something new, and it’s particularly useful against heavy enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-steeled-veterans">Steeled Veterans</h3>



<p>Ask any Helldivers 2 player for their favorite weapons, and the SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary Shotgun will more than likely be mentioned.</p>



<p>Dishing out huge damage and setting enemies on fire, the Breaker Incendiary Shotgun is the perfect tool for dealing with large swarms of enemies, and there’s also the P-4 Senator Pistol to consider, too.  </p>



<p>Also included in the Warbond is the AR-23C Liberator Concussive that, although highly situational, can be a powerful asset to stun large enemies.</p>

Build a fully customizable and upgradeable skyship that serves as both your home base and your battleship against the colossal sky creatures known as the Seraph. Brave the dizzying heights with a physics-based grappling hook, wingsuits, and gliders, and enjoy the freedom to explore the endless possibilities that await.</p><p>In 2017, Bossa Games launched the ambitious sandbox MMO world of <em>Worlds Adrift</em> into Early Access. While the game ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release, the passion for the project and the world they created was never diminished or forgotten. When the time was right, Bossa decided to rebuild upon the strong groundwork left behind in <em>Worlds Adrift</em>‘s wake. <em>Lost Skies</em> is that spiritual successor in every way.</p><p>Lead Game Designer Luke Williams had this to say about the process of bringing <em>Lost Skies</em> to life: “<em>Lost Skies</em> was such a unique opportunity for a designer—if you could go back and revisit themes and experiences, what would you do? So we really wanted to elevate the elements players loved from <em>Worlds Adrift</em>, such as exploring hundreds of floating islands and building an entirely unique skyship from all the rare materials and parts you come across on your journey. Also some huge sky filling bosses thrown in for good measure. We’ve spent the last three years working with our community to make sure we’ve built an experience players can enjoy for years to come.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The small but mighty team at Bossa Games, creators of physics-fueled hits like <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> and <em>I Am Fish</em>, has worked tirelessly on making <em>Lost Skies</em> the best possible experience for past <em>Worlds Adrift</em> players and new players alike. Drawing on their past successes, they’ve built <em>Lost Skies</em> into a playground of fun and inventive mechanics, including the grapple hook which is so good that it’s been called the best grappling system by players and feels as smooth and rewarding as you’d expect from a AAA title.</p><p>Here are some of the team’s big updates and accomplishments for <em>Lost Skies</em> prior to the 1.0 release:</p><ul><li><strong>Get Creative</strong> – The introduction of the Island Creator prior to launch allowed players to craft their own islands, share them with the community, and get ready to fly when Early Access arrived. Dozens of these hand-crafted islands populate the world players explore on a daily basis. Players can also unleash their creativity by designing skyships however they choose, <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the perfect home base among the clouds!</li><li><strong>Play Your Way</strong> – Full keybinding was added to allow players to customize their keys in order to climb, grapple, glide, and fight with whatever keys best suit them.</li><li><strong>Content, Content, Content</strong> – New weapons, ship assets, naval boss battles, regions, puzzles, a map table, storage naming, better inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and so much more has been added during the Early Access period and is ready for all players to enjoy in the 1.0 launch.</li><li><strong>Improvements Galore</strong> – From day one, the team worked to remove bugs, deliver quality of life updates, and ensure the utmost stability for 1.0 while players journeyed through the clouds.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.0 Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Lost Skies | 1.0 Launch Trailer | Humble Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCawAfVtLHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/lost-skies-launches-september-17]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the more exciting reveals during Gamescom's Opening Night Live ceremony last week was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-announced-includes-content-from">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>. Not only is TT Games returning to the Caped Crusader – its first time since 2014's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/lego_batman_3_beyond_gotham/b/xboxone/archive/2014/11/14/identity-crisis-game-informer-lego-batman-3-beyond-gotham-review.aspx">Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham</a> – but it's doing so with a brand-new take on the superhero... kinda. I say that because a lot of Legacy of the Dark Knight will feel familiar to those who watch and read about Bruce Wayne's bat-shaped half, and that's by design.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of continuing its original storytelling from the first three Lego Batman games, TT Games is fusing various Batman media, namely films like the Dark Knight trilogy and 2022's <em>The Batman</em>, to tell a definitive story. I played roughly 50 minutes of the game and caught references to <em>Batman </em>(1989), Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and even the 2010 animated feature, <em>Batman: Under the Red Hood.</em> TT Games promises even more, including 1966's <em>Batman</em>, <em>Batman Returns</em>, and various comics and graphic novels.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Immediately after hearing and seeing all these references, I was curious how TT Games approached utilizing all these various (and unique) properties to tell a single, cohesive story. Assistant design director Jimmy Sedota tells me it's about mashing together the highlights.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been a fun challenge," he says. "We're pulling from so much. There's so much inspiration and reference out there, so as we started developing the story, we looked at some of the most iconic moments that we know, that even casual fans would recognize [...] and so we started with that, the highlight moments, and we started to see how we could lay out a single story that's our retelling that also references that stuff.</p><p>"Then from there, we started pulling more and more of that deep lore in, so looking at comics, TV, and all that stuff, and really starting to find moments like, 'Oh, we can get this nice lore cut in here, and we can reference <em>this </em>thing here.' Even in the ACE Chemicals mission you played, there are definitely references to the 1989 film, but also <em>Under the Red Hood</em>, and some stuff from the comics. And we feel that we've married that all in a way that tells a unique story, but is something that players and fans will recognize as familiar at the same time, with, of course, our humor and Lego TT Games twist on it."</p>

<p>That ACE Chemicals mission Sedota mentions was the primary focus of my hands-on preview at this year's Gamescom in Cologne, Germany last week, and it was a blast. It also showed me that Legacy of the Dark Knight doesn't feature inspiration from <em>just</em> movies, TV, and comics – it takes massive inspiration from Rocksteady Studios' Batman Arkham series. And wow, am I so glad it does.&nbsp;</p><p>I've enjoyed previous TT Games Lego versions of beloved characters and stories, including Batman, but combat has always been the weakest point of the experiences for me. It felt too simple, with not enough challenge to keep me engaged. TT Games is tackling this in two ways: using Arkham-inspired combat and including, for the first time in its Lego games' history, difficulty options.&nbsp;</p><p>There are three combat difficulty options: Classic, which "offers a traditional Lego experience" with unlimited lives, fewer enemies, and less frequency of advanced enemy types; Caped Crusader, which "offers a balanced focus on combat and story" with unlimited lives, more enemies, and advanced enemy types that appear more frequently; and finally, Dark Knight, which "offers harder combat for heroes seeking a challenge" with limited lives, even more enemies/frequent appearances by advanced enemy types. Dark Knight also includes a level reset upon losing all your lives. While you can gain lives by collecting hearts in missions, if you lose all of them, you'll need to restart the entire level.&nbsp;</p><p>I chose Dark Knight for my ACE Chemicals mission, and I'm so glad I did. It's a perfect challenge for the game's Arkham-inspired combat, and I quickly fell back into my habits of sneaking around, taking enemies out, and grappling to high-up gargoyles and perches to plan my next attack. I performed stealth takedowns from the ground, even sneaking around in underground grates and through air ventilation shafts (where, like the Arkham games, your view transitions into first-person). Unfortunately, I was unable to perform stealth takedowns from gargoyles and perches, and I'm not sure if that will be an aspect of the game's combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, stealth feels incredible, especially when coupled with distractions like throwing Batarangs or blowing up explosive barrels. Outside of stealth, my Arkham memories continued to push to the forefront of my brain as I pummeled enemies with the Square button, countering them with Triangle, and flipping over shielded enemies for attacks from behind with Circle. I even dodged bullets shot my way to glorious effect. It really feels like playing an Akrham game, but smartly, combat features the unique TT Games twist you expect. Sometimes takedowns were straightforward – other times, like while playing as Jim Gordon (who resembled the Gary Oldman version from Christopher Nolan's Batman films, though appearance varies based on costumes), I bashed an enemy over the head with a bug-catching net to comedic effect.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're huge fans of what Rocksteady was able to achieve [...] and this was built from the ground up at TT for what we think is the best Lego Batman combat system for our fans and for our games," Sedota says. "We have co-op, multiple playable characters over the course of the story campaign, gadgets, and more, and we feel we've created something uniquely our own." I do see how Legacy of the Dark Knight features unique flourishes in combat, courtesy of TT Games, but also... this combat is basically just Arkham combat, and that's great! That combat rule,s and it feels fantastic here!</p><p>I especially love all the humorous touches TT Games has added to its otherwise classic take on Gotham, complete with rainy nights, lots of neon signage, dangerous streets, and enemies galore. Similar to TT Games' more recent Lego games, not everything in this game is made of blocks. Instead, TT Games uses Lego as signposts to players.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a really good mix of art direction, design direction, and usability and UX design," Sedota says when I ask how the team balances Lego vs real-world elements in-game. "When you see Lego, you expect to be able to smash it. [Legacy of the Dark Knight] still feels like a really beautiful modern game, but it still has plenty of Lego touches, and when you see those, you know most are interactable. That's for players to recognize, 'Oh, I can interact with that.' That's the marriage of our design and visuals."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the ACE Chemicals mission I complete, Batman and Gordon are tasked with infiltrating the compound, and I mostly stick to the shadows to do so, though I find myself in a couple of brawls, too. Switching back and forth between these two characters is good fun, as Batman plays, like, well, Batman, while Gordon uses a non-lethal gun to shoot giant sticky globs onto enemies, making them easy to beat up. Outside of combat, the mission requires these two characters to work together. As I'm playing solo, switching is as easy as tapping on the d-pad, but TT Games envisions me playing couch co-op with someone else taking control of the opposite character. There are light, easy puzzles to complete that require switching from Batman to Gordon, then back to Batman, and vice versa, every so often in this mission, and it feels reminiscent of TT Games' typical puzzle design.&nbsp;</p><p>This mission ends how you might expect, as a figure under a Red Hood falls into a vat of acid and may or may not become a certain villain in Batman's extensive rogue gallery: Joker.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Joker, if you saw the reveal trailer, you likely recognized that Legacy of the Dark Knight features a Joker inspired by Heath Ledger's legendary performance, at least in appearance. I don't encounter the Joker in my preview, but Sedota tells me the characters in this game aren't based on a single iteration of the character. The team is drawing inspiration from various Batman media, and while costumes will allow different characters to resemble specific iterations, those costumes don't alter the character. Batman and other characters in Legacy of the Dark Knight will remain consistent in their personalities – you only choose to have your Batman look like Robert Pattinson's, Christian Bale's, or maybe even Adam West's iconic take.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're not just doing all the movies," Sedota tells me. "There's a single [English] voice actor [for Batman] that's constant throughout. Even as Batman progresses, the story features that single character, but we're bringing out some humor, keeping it light, and building this all through story and gameplay mechanics."&nbsp;</p><p>However, Sedota tells me the consistency is primarily for Batman and the extended Bat-family, teasing that we might see more character evolution in the game's villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond the ACE Chemicals mission, I also got to play around and explore the open-world Gotham, and it's a visual treat. Immediately, I look for the nearest grapple point and am thrilled to learn that you can tap the jump button for a powerful boost mid-grapple when you reach the end point, similar to the Arkham games. This sends Batman flying high into the sky, and I glide down a bit before dive-bombing into a group of unsuspecting enemies below. After this, I solve a quick Riddler Puzzle Box and find a Wayne Tech Cache with a Lego piece inside. By clicking the right stick, Batman utilizes Detect, which shows you where to go and locates nearby things to interact with – it's basically detective vision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I eventually make my way down to the streets below and call up the Batmobile via the d-pad. The one that appears is the muscle car variant seen in <em>The Batman</em>, complete with its roaring turbo. TT Games has already shown off the Tumbler from the Dark Knight trilogy and the 1966 Batmobile, and I look forward to other iterations that might appear. Driving around feels great, as rain pours from the moody sky, causing the neon signs above to glisten in reflections on the streets. I complete a quick time-trial race and can already tell I'm going to be spending a decent chunk of time behind the wheel in Legacy of the Dark Knight. As for which Gotham this is, it's an original version from TT Games, but, like the rest of the game, it draws from a wide range of Batman media.&nbsp;</p><p>"We looked at lots of maps, games, and comics, in particular, and looked at the basic structure of certain things you need to have in Gotham," Sedota says. "There are always multiple islands, and we found something for the right size of our game, and there are different islands that unlock as you go through the main story, and new content opens up." He adds that you'll have all four islands of Gotham unlocked about halfway through the main story, but lots of "new activities" will appear over the entire course of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This open-world Gotham, like the ACE Chemicals mission, is impressive. I'm more impressed with a TT Games Lego game than I've ever been with Legacy of the Dark Knight, and I've only played for 50 minutes. As a massive Batman fan desperate for another video game adventure with the Caped Crusader, TT Games seems set to deliver everything I want and more. Truly, I cannot wait, and I'm legitimately annoyed I have to until 2026 (but please take your time, TT Games, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/21/new-report-details-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-sagas-rocky-development-and-studio">don't crunch</a>).&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-next-arkham-game-youve-been]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Space can be a lonely place, what with it being - as a wise man once famously put it - so vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big and all. Which is where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> new Voyagers update comes in. Now, those long treks across the infinite expanse needn't be quite so lonely thanks to the introduction of multi-crew space ships you can build, pilot, and stroll around with friends.
</p>
<p>
Customisable ships - not to be confused with No Man's Sky's existing customisable freighters, which essentially serve as gargantuan deep space bases - have been at the top of many a fan's wishlist for quite some time. And today's Voyagers update look to deliver and then some. After progressing to a certain point in the story, players gain access to a hangar-like workshop where new Corvette spaceships can be engineered both outside and within. Customisable components include hulls, wings, landing gear, engine parts, thrusters, and weapons, and all can be arranged to suit players' whims.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the habitable interior. "Add sleeping quarters," developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> explains, "and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready for adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team." There's also talk of med-bays and war rooms, or you can just add a window and watch the universe go by. And for thrillseekers, it's even possible to flip open the Corvette's airlock and go for a space walk together or, once within a planet's atmosphere, sky dive to the ground.

<p>
While newcomers to No Man's Sky won't have immediate access to Corvette construction given its unlock requirements, they'll still be able to experience the feature in a brand-new limited-time Expedition. Alongside the usual array of cosmetic rewards, this'll also unlock some ship parts players might find useful when trying to build their own vehicles in the core sim.
</p><p>
Hello Games says it's had to rework "almost every part" of No Man's Sky to accommodate Corvettes and their relative spaces, and to ensure crews can still roam their ship's corridors and continue editing during the likes of warp jumps and planetary approaches. Much of the tech, it says, is shared with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">upcoming Light No Fire</a>, which will feature vast oceans players can similarly explore together on a single boat. This isn't the first time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">No Man's Sky has adopted technology implemented for Hello Games' Earth-sized planet sim</a>.
</p>
<p>
And it sounds like Hello Games is still far from done. "The most exciting thing about Voyagers for me," writes Hello Games' boss Sean Murray, "is the possibilities it opens in the future for No Man's Sky, and I can't wait to see where the team takes it from here."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox appears to be rethinking its plan to charge for two of the six playable clans in the game.</p>
<p>Community developer DebbieElla told the Bloodlines 2 Discord community last night (spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-chinese-room-will-make-adjustments-after-feedback-about-locking-2-clans-behind-day-one-dlc-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2.1281309/">ResetEra</a>): "We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of launch to reflect this. We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The comment comes a week after Paradox announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">the release date for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which is 21st October, along with pricing details for the game. It was then we learned the companies intended to charge £20 extra to access two clans in the game, via a Shadows and Silk content pack.</p>
<p>The Shadows and Silk pack can be bought alone for £18.69/€22/$22, or as part of a Premium Edition for £75/€90/$90, which also includes a cosmetic-focused Santa Monica Memories pack. For reference, the Standard Edition of the game costs £50/€60/$60.</p>

<p>At a glance, this might not seem untoward. Plenty of games sell additional content at launch and bundle it with premium editions of a game. The base price of Bloodlines 2 even appears to have been adjusted because of it, so it's cheaper than other full-priced games. But the problem comes from the content being charged for itself: the clans.</p><p>The clans in Bloodlines 2 are a core part of the game. Choosing one is equivalent to choosing your character class and therefore the playstyle you're opting for. Clans also determine the storied group you belong to in the world and give you access to different clothing options and clan-specific non-player characters. Clans are not superfluous, cosmetic content.</p>
<p>What's more, the locked Toreador and Lasombra clans are highly desirable. Toreador are a clan built around the iconic archetype of vampires as seductive, sexy beings, and come fitted with the power to enthrall their prey by, yes, kissing them. Lasombra, on the other hand, do their work in the shadows, and can manipulate shadows to tangle and hold enemies and teleport themselves. I tried both clans briefly in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">the Bloodlines 2 preview build I played</a> and enjoyed them, especially Lasombra.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Important caveat: you can access powers from another clan in Bloodlines 2, so you're not locked to only doing things your clan offers. Every time you gain a higher tier of power, you'll see other powers listed to the left and right of them that belong to other clans. You can unlock them but doing so is costly and complicated. You need to pay a higher skill-point cost for them as well as a price related to other 'currencies' in the game, which are usually earned by drinking special types of blood, and you need to find certain NPCs to teach these powers to you.</p>
<p>It's a faff, in other words, so it's more likely your experience of Bloodlines 2 will be unlocking your clan-specific powers first before branching into other clan's abilities. Your clan choice, therefore, is an important one, and so the decision to paywall access to a third of them is notable.</p><p>The justification for doing it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">as relayed by developer The Chinese Room to Rock Paper Shotgun at Gamescom</a>, was these two clans represented content developed beyond what was originally planned for the game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">The Chinese Room inherited development of Bloodlines 2 </a>from Hardsuit Labs, remember - it didn't originate it. So The Chinese Room's reasoning was this was additional content developed for the game, so it would sell it as such at release. But if the content is developed during a game's main development period, is it really additional? And if it appears alongside other content in the game, only with a padlock over it, is it really additive or withheld?</p>
<p>Portioning off parts of a game to be sold around release is nothing new. Paradox itself has a track record of leveraging paid-for downloadable content as a significant source of income for games it makes. It was expected, to a degree, here. But Paradox has chosen the wrong approach. Carving off core gameplay will never be an acceptable proposition, and its decision has tainted the upcoming arrival of an excruciatingly long-awaited game. Here's hoping the "adjustments" being considered will turn this situation around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced two brand new features for its SNES Classics catalog on the Nintendo Switch Online service, and if you're a connoisseur of strategy and puzzle games, this one's for you.</p>

<p>First up, select SNES games now support mouse controls on Switch Online. Naturally, this includes&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">released on the service last month</a>; in fact, Nintendo says some games "can only be played using mouse controls", seemingly including&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>.</p>

<p>Other games support mouse controls as well, though; the trailer demonstrating the new mouse control feature shows not only&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>being played, but also&nbsp;<em>Mario's Super Picross&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, both of which are probably a lot more satisfying with a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=lH5X3M39 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=1FWa5CpH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now play some SNES Classics on Nintendo Switch Online with mouse controls.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on Switch 2, then the SNES games that support mouse controls will be playable with the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, but if you're on the original Switch, you'll need to hook up a USB mouse to take advantage of this new feature.</p>

<p>As well as mouse controls, the new update also brings the ability to both view and change the controls for the SNES game you're playing. If there are button mappings that don't quite suit your play style, you can change them around to suit you.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to save different mappings and configurations for each game, so you won't have to stick with the mappings you set up for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>. Nintendo isn't that heartless.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off the new features being added to Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Both mouse controls and the ability to remap your buttons are available right now if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. Of course, if you're not, you'll need to sign up to get access to the SNES catalog.</p>

I’m not surprised, really. With Games Workshop and publisher Focus Entertainment watching his every word like the Inquisition on the hunt for heresy, Willits must be careful to keep his cards close to his chest or else risk being declared a heretic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I was able to get <em>something</em> out of him on the hotly anticipated sequel, namely that Games Workshop is throwing all sorts of ideas at Saber right now, and some of them are apparently "amazing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began my foray into Space Marine 3 territory by asking Willits why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">the game was announced relatively soon after the release of Space Marine 2</a>. Willits dodged the question, saying: “It's just how we work with Focus… Again, it was massively successful for us, Space Marine 2, and Focus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That it was indeed. Space Marine 2 may well be the most successful Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">It sold over 7 million copies less than a year after going on sale</a>, and, by Willits’ own admission, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">changed everything for Saber Interactive</a>. Even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 3 was inevitable, then, but questions remain. Where will Lieutenant Titus and co head next? Will we see new factions? Will Saber expand co-op beyond the three-player limit? Will there be actual meaningful PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Willits wasn’t ready to answer these types of questions, but did tease ideas are coming from Games Workshop itself — and Saber is excited by them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're working with Games Workshop, they’re the best ever,” he said. “And there’s such a rich universe that we’re pulling stuff [from]. And they've given us some ideas that are amazing. They have given us some really cool ideas. Their brains are just like… wow. So lots of super great ideas from Games Workshop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation of the story, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Space Marine 2 fans were concerned about the timing of Space Marine 3's announcement, but <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/glahjvsr/space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Games Workshop has said</u></a> Space Marine 3 "is likely years away from release,” and Saber has promised to continue to support Space Marine 2 for some time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits pointed to the support Saber's World War Z has enjoyed as the model it’s following for Space Marine 2. A second year of Space Marine 2 content, which Focus has discussed, is already on the way.

        <p>Load up alone or with a friend for two player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [321 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a>erative gameplay in this stylized pixel-painted love letter to the classic shooters of yesteryear.</p><p>Take on the role of Alex, who awakes on-board a Capital Battleship on the way to war – only to find that much of the crew is dead, and the ship is infested with monsters. Joined by an AI companion and his dim-witted robot assistant Ody-6, Alex sets off on a journey where every fight is a desperate battle against the unknown—and doom itself. The ship is a war zone. You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end! Upgrade your abilities after each death before rejoining the battle as a better, more fearsome killing machine.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,763 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Combat</strong> – Inspired by classic shooters, Moros Protocol combines fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> with adaptability and customization.

                <p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement on August 26, and it was one of the biggest stories on the internet that day. Many big brands hopped on the train to try to drive engagement and awareness for their own franchises, and this included some video game companies.</p><p>The Halo account posted an image of Halo's Buck and Veronica Dare, with the same caption that Swift used in her announcement, "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married."</p><p>The official Sonic the Hedgehog account, meanwhile, re-shared the engagement announcement to its story on Instagram with the caption, "I think I found the fourth Chaos Emerald..."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4557745-screenshot2025-08-27at8.08.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557745" data-ratio="1.7441441441441" data-width="555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4557745-screenshot2025-08-27at8.08.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557745"></a><figcaption>Sonic reacts to the Swift/Kelce engagement</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4557745-screenshot2025-08-27at8.08.57am.png"></figure><p>Swift and Kelce got engaged some time ago but only just jointly shared the news with the world this week. It became a top-trending story all over the world, which is no surprise given Swift's popularity.

<p>I jest, of course, I fully remember the experience, thank you very much! Usually, Kirby is a little low-stakes for my liking, but Forgotten Land swerved my personal issues with this series by giving us a fantastic 3D adventure that was as creative and exciting with its mechanics as it was beautiful to behold. And remember how excited we all got for Mouthful Mode? Remember Kirby car? Oh, how we laughed!</p>
<p>Anyway, Kirby hath returned, and he's packing a surprising amount of new content to boot in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby And The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> (or KATFW - NS2E + SCW for short). Here, Nintendo has given the game a bit of the old "come and look what our fancy new console can do, mate!"</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158259/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Switch 2 Edition, Forgotten Land now looks and runs much better, and there's a fully-earned triumphalism in the re-themed, remixed levels you get in Star-Crossed World, as you bash mysterious crystals and watch old levels magically come alive with frost and ice, sparkling gems and frozen paths carved into the sky. All of this reflecting and glistening in ways the Switch 1 may well have keeled over trying to process.</p>
<p>It's all very fancy. And the reason for all of these icy shifts in tone? Well, I won't ruin the story, for what it's worth, but a big mysterious meteor has crash-landed, and Kirby's services are once again required in order to hoover up crystals, defeat bosses, rescue cute little 'Starries', slap the silliness out of a whole load of diamanté-encrusted poodles, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The arrival of said meteor sees two remixed levels opened up on each of the game's six original map regions, for a total of 12 new levels overall. In the game's first region, Natural Plains, you get a new version of the opening beach arrival level, and a further remix in the form of a revisit to the game's mall. These remixes, whilst initially maybe a tad disappointing, in that they're essentially re-using areas, soon prove themselves to be some of the best, flashiest, and most exciting levels in the entire package.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158252/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you progress through your icy return trip to the mall, as an example of this, the game goes out of its way to lift you up, out and above where you've been before, as it does in all the rest of these new offerings, and the platforming action that results is the tightest and most challenging I've played in a Kirby game thus far. My one recurring issue with the series resolved in an icy instant — difficulty. Slippery surfaces create a little more tension in making jumps and landings, new ice-based mini-bosses prove fun to best, and some of the best aspects of the main game, such as the car, make a return in fun ways.</p>
<p>So it's a hefty amount of new game all told, especially considering the reasonable price of upgrading for players who own the base game already. And that's not all, as whilst the number of new remixed regions comes in at a solid amount of new content by itself, Nintendo has gone the whole hog and added new transformations, a whole new collectibles 'EX' directory, and a few other things besides that I won't spoil.</p>
<p>I'd even go so far as to say that the new Gear Mouth transformation, which I'm sure everyone has seen by now, is one of the most engagingly tactile Kirby alterations ever. And this wee guy has turned into a whole lot of things in his life. I love how the cog's teeth stick to walls, and the way the HD Rumble really lets you feel the weight and bumpiness as you trundle up platforms and across gaps. This is top platforming fun, no matter who you are or where your skill level might be with this stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158254/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Add in a few more transformations such as Spring Mouth (jump really high and then smash through stuff), and Sign Mouth (downhill racing, anyone?) and you've got a perfectly balanced sprinkling of new things to try out across a bunch of levels that look and play amazingly well. Again, I don't feel like you're getting short-changed because these are "just" remixed levels, as the amount of new things to do, see, and collect makes them feel like much more.</p>
<p>For me, all this added goodness makes it impossible not to re-run through the entire game alongside the new levels. Thankfully, Nintendo has made this nice and easy to do here, as you can jump between normal base game stuff and the new additions, all from the same map. Plus, switching to stage lists and collectibles takes nothing more than a quick press of 'X' to cycle between Forgotten Land and Star-Crossed World stats. For two-player co-op, which is also a cinch to jump in and out of, there's a ton of colourful fun to be had, too, and my kids were blazing through it all with no issues.</p>

<p>The base game, with its fantastic campaign, has never looked or felt better to play, either. These are big upgrades, from 30fps (with the odd creak) and a slightly smeared look, to buttery smooth 60fps and crystal clear resolution in both docked and handheld. So mixing things up, jumping back in to retread old ground whilst bashing through new areas for more Starries, it all feels equally fresh and looks fantastic across the board.</p>
<p>One final detail to note is that the hub town's Colosseum also has something new going on, although I can't go into that just now! All in all, though, it rounds out what is a very generous helping of new things on top of a visual and performance touch-up that makes it very hard for me to pick holes.</p>
<p>Honestly, as far as Kirby goes, this really is now his finest platforming hour, with the only thing really holding him back being the repetitiveness of some of the reused bosses in the base game, which is still an issue here. Regardless of this minor issue, though, this is still easily one of the best and most polished 3D platformers on Switch or Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kirby And The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World gives you the base Forgotten Land experience at a delicious 60fps with a whole big bunch of new content thrown in for good measure. The 12 remixed areas that make up the DLC are uniformly delightful, the new transformations are excellent, and there's even new challenges for hardcore Kirby fans to get stuck into.</p>
<p>One of the best games on Switch, and one of my favourite 3D platformers in years, polished to a sparkly sheen and packing some meaningful new content? That's a very easy recommendation and a truly excellent addition to the Switch 2's early lineup.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As I’ve been shouting from the rooftops for years now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> is one of the most criminally-underrated Switch exclusives, so I was quite happy when it was revealed it would be one of the first OG Switch titles to get a fancy Switch 2 update. Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World adds both a new layer of polish to the game's presentation and a significant amount of fresh content for Kirby-hungry fans to devour.</p>



<p>So, is the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land a well-rounded meal? Or will it leave a bad taste in your mouth? Float onward for the answer...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I mentioned following my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions">previous brief hands-on time</a> with the upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, the game is the best-looking of the initial batch of Switch 2 updates to my eye. Per Nintendo itself, the game now runs at 1440p, but that resolution seems less dynamic than some other Switch 2 upgrades, as the game simply looks sharper than, say, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on">Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Of course, it could be that the original game’s assets were just more detailed and suited to this kind of upgrade, as it’s one of the most impressive-looking Switch titles. Now, it’s one of the most impressive-looking <em>Switch 2</em> titles – crisp, colorful, and bursting with personality. Oh, and yes, the bump to 60fps is definitely felt. The game was perfectly playable at 30fps, but everything feels just a little nicer at 60fps. I really can't find any fault with this game's technical upgrade.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But the visual upgrade is just the beginning. The Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land also comes with what’s essentially a whole new DLC mini-campaign, Star-Crossed World, available any time after completing the original game’s first world. A mysterious meteor crashes to earth, causing an imposing volcanic island to rise from the ocean. On this island, our pink hero comes across the heart-shaped “Star of Darkness,” which seems more than a little ominous, so Kirby sets about rescuing "Starries," who have the power to contain the darkness (these little alien guys are basically this DLC’s version of the original game’s Waddle Dees).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Star-Crossed World campaign tasks players with revisiting several stages from the original game (2 per world, for a total of 12 remixed stages), which are now littered with crystals and “Starryflowers,” which can be broken to reveal new, glowing crystalline pathways. All this crystally stuff also affects the game’s enemies and minibosses, making them a somewhat-stiffer challenge. Additionally, there are a few new “Mouthful Mode” transformations, including a bouncy spring, a wall-climbing gear, and a sign that can be used for fun, slippy-slidy sledding sections. Several classic Mouthful transformations also return and are used in fun and sometimes unique ways.</p>



<p>Now, when I first saw the description and trailers for Star-Crossed World, I would say I was only <em>moderately </em>excited. I figured I'd basically be playing through familiar stages, just a little tougher, a little different. Thankfully, that’s not really the case. For instance, in the Star-Crossed World version of the Abandoned Beach stage things begin as usual, but then, after less than a minute, the sea literally parts, revealing a rainbow-coral-coated ocean floor. What follows is almost an entirely-different level than the one in the original game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case for pretty much all of these remixed “Starry Stages.” Level themes and assets may be reused, but these are essentially completely new stage layouts, and they're just as fun, sometimes <em>moreso</em>, than those in the excellent original game. These stages are also packed with all the usual secrets, including hidden Starries and a whole new set of collectible capsule figurines. You can also tackle a new extra-tough Colosseum run, and as you might expect, there's a daunting final challenge waiting for you once you've completed all the Starry Stages.</p>



<p>Granted, there are some things missing from this DLC. There are no new regular copy abilities or Treasure Road challenge stages here, but then again, this isn't a full sequel. For an extra 20 dollars you're getting a solid 4 to 5 hours of additional content, and those who want to 100 percent everything can always go back for second helpings. </p>

<p><strong>An Early Switch 2 Super Star</strong></p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is the first Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade I can fully, unequivocally recommend. The game's technical update wows and the new Star-Crossed World content is inventive, fun, and easily worth the $20 premium on its own. Between this Switch 2 update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, fans of Nintendo's pink puffball are eating hearty this year.</p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World launches on August 28. Those who already own the Switch version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

            <p>A group of current and former Microsoft employees have staged a sit-in protest in the office of company president Brad Smith over the use of Azure and generative AI technologies by the Israeli military during their on-going bombardment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766324/microsoft-building-34-lockdown-protesters-brad-smith-office">The Verge</a>, the protestors belonged to the No Azure for Apartheid activist group, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">continues to petition Microsoft</a> to terminate all of their contracts with the Israeli government and military. Microsoft president Brad Smith claimed in a subsequent press briefing that the group of protestors consisted of seven people, with two being current Microsoft staff, and were removed from the office by Redmond police.</p>
<p>No Azure for Apartheid organizer and former Microsoft employee Abdo Mohamed confirmed to The Verge that Microsoft staffers Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle were part of the protest, alongside former staff Vaniya Agrawal, Hossam Nasr, and Joe Lopez.</p>
<p>Following the protest, Smith staged a press briefing in his office, declaring that Microsoft are "committed to ensuring [their] human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East." "When seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office, plant listening devices — even in crude form, in the form of telephones, cellphones hidden under couches and behind books — that’s not ok. When they’re asked to leave and they refused, that’s not ok," the exec said. Smith complaining about the planting of listening devices seems rather ironic, given that Microsoft stand accused of collaborating with Israeli military efforts to keep Palestinians under surveillance.</p>

<p>When asked whether the two current Microsoft workers who were part of the sit-in, which was livestreamed on Twitch, will face any internal disciplinary measures for doing so, Smith said the following:</p>
<blockquote>We'll take a look. I think one or two of them may have also been arrested last week. So, if somebody's been arrested twice, that's a situation that is not standard employee conduct I think it's fair to say. I don't think it would be regarded as standard employee conduct by any of the places where you [gestures to media present] work, [or] frankly any of the places where anybody works.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the briefing, Smith addressed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">The Guardian's recent report</a> about Microsoft's Azure cloud platform being used in the surveillance of Palestinians by Israel, saying that Microsoft are investigating the report's allegations. "We are working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and we will," he said.</p><p>He also touched on Microsoft having contacted the FBI in April this year, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-26/microsoft-asked-fbi-for-help-with-israel-gaza-protests?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) reporting that the company had asked the body to provide information on pro-Palestinian protests that might target Microsoft. The exec said he'd first heard about this last week, and subsequently cited "one of our security folks" as having sent the email to the "local FBI office", claiming that it was a more general inquiry about "disruptions" the FBI could see potentially being planned in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>This latest protest comes as groups like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement</a> continue to call for people to boycott Microsoft and Xbox products over the company's relationship with the Israeli miliary, with unionised staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> developers Arkane Studios recently having <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arkane-studios-union-publishes-open-letter-to-microsoft-demanding-a-stop-to-israeli-support">voiced their support</a> for both the BDS boycott and No Azure for Apartheid's efforts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has seen a fresh surge in the push to spread democracy around the universe following a long-awaited Xbox launch, which came alongside a boost in players on Steam.</p>



<p>Initially released on PlayStation 5 and PC, Sony made the big move to push the title onto Xbox Series X|S on August 26, marking a historic moment with the first time a Sony first-party exclusive made the jump to Microsoft. As part of the launch, a huge collab was added with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>.</p>



<p>Though it was expected that the servers would be flooded with new players on Xbox, the release also led to a huge boost on Steam to secure the highest concurrent totals in over a year.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A big boost. Credit to Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> shows the total number of concurrent players on Steam on August 26 hit 167,795, the highest amount since April 2024—which came just before a huge drop following an account-linking controversy.</p>



<p>The numbers are higher than the peaks seen after both the Omens of Tyranny and Heart of Democracy updates, showing that the impact of the Xbox launch spreads beyond just one platform.</p>



<p>Players have seemingly not been put off by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of cross-progression</a> in the title, with the crossplay support allowing new players on Xbox to join up with friends on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>Steam numbers usually peak at the weekend too, so Helldivers 2 could see another boost in the coming days in the first weekend following the launch on Xbox. Following that, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh update lands next week</a>, adding more content to the game.</p>

			<p>Despite having been out for well over a year, players are still making some interesting discoveries in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth highlighting the amazing depth of its combat system which is sadly left unexplored due to the game's generally low difficulty level.</p>



<p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2052brad">Brad Man</a> shared on YouTube two videos highlighting the hidden properties of Tifa's Overpower ability and Red XIII's Crescent Claws and Reaper Touch. The hidden properties of Overpower, in particular, can completely shake up combat, allowing Tifa and the rest of the party to interrupt and launch in the air even heavier enemies, resulting in a more satisfying experience. As such, it's really weird how the game doesn't provide any information on these mechanics, ultimately ending up reinforcing the wrong idea that some have regarding what is, in my opinion, one of the best combat systems seen in modern role-playing games.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was originally released on PlayStation 5 on February 29 2024, and was ported one year later on PC. Although plenty of mods have been released on PC to improve the experience and introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-requested-feature/">features and mechanics</a> not available in the vanilla version of the game, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that's more than worthy experiencing, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. With Final Fantasy VII Remake hitting the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S soon, there's little doubt the rest of the trilogy will eventually make its way onto every modern gaming platform at some point.</p>

<p>Hell is Us is a brand-new action game headed up by Rogue Factor and supported by Nacon. It’s launching in a busy 2025 period and competing against some real AAA brutes. Nevertheless, if you’re hyped for it, let’s check out the Hell is Us release date and announced start times.</p>



<p>You take the reins of Rémi in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell is Us</a>. You fight Hollow Walkers, and the supernatural gameplay and storytelling are a major part of the game’s fabric. It leans into the ‘punishing’ aspect of combat, but from what I’ve seen so far, it looks to be infinitely rewarding. With 2025 building up to a stacked climax, Hell is Us has got its work cut out.</p>



<p>I’ve got everything you need to know about Hell is Us’ release date, and start times for major time zones. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hell-is-us-coming-out">When is Hell is Us Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us is scheduled to release on September 4 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>As I’ve said, September 2025 is a crazy one for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> are just some of the blockbuster launches on the way.</p>



<p>A new IP like Hell is Us is going to have a tough time competing. But if you’re into your action games, chances are this supersedes other releases anyway!</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-start-times-amp-early-access-launch-information">Hell is Us Start Times &amp; Early Access Launch Information</h2>



<p><strong>We believe Hell is Us Standard Edition goes live at 1 AM PDT on September 4, and early access starts 72 hours ahead of time on September 1.</strong></p>



<p>There’s an early access incentive for Hell is Us. If you choose to do this, you essentially jump the queue by three days. This does require you to shell out even more cash for the Deluxe Edition, though. It all depends on how keen you are for Hell is Us and its release date.</p>



<p>While you contemplate this, here are the release date and start time details across key US time zones, the United Kingdom, and Australia—thanks to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP6665-PPSA09259_00-HIU0000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>
