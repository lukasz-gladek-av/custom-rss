			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth team may switch from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5 for the third and final entry in the remake project, and the decision will depend on some factors.</p>
<p>Speaking with Japanese publication <a href="https://cgworld.jp/article/202408-ff7reb-01.html">CG World</a>, as translated on X by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1823392560729194696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genki</a>, director Naoki Hamaguchi said that the development team is considering switching to Unreal Engine 5 for the next game but believes what players want most for them is to deliver the game in good shape as soon as possible. As such, the decision will be made based on whether it will be faster to switch engines or whether it is best to develop the game at once using UE4 as in the previous games. The first year of work will be extremely important, as it will be a prototyping period that will determine the direction of the game. The same was done with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, as its first year of development was conducted in parallel with the development of Intergrade, a decision that definitely paid off, given the game's high quality.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's sequel that will conclude the story. Earlier this month, we heard that it will include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-revamped-part-3/">Queen's Blood card mini-game</a> in a revamped form, but that is the only thing that has been confirmed for what is likely going to become one of the most anticipated JRPGs of the coming years.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-knightling-is-an-adorable-looking-platformer-launching-next-year.952938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and wonderfully-named developer Twirlbound have announced&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, a fantasy action-adventure game with platforming and puzzle elements that's set to debut next year.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>will offer "a mix of exploration, questing, combat and platforming", and will let you loose in a semi-open world armed only with your trusty shield.</p>
<p>The setup is rather sweetly straightforward; you are the titular Knightling, and your master, Sir Lionstone, has disappeared. It's up to you to discover what's happened to him and save the realm of Clesseia before monsters, bandits, and other beasties take over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-knightling-announcement-bat.jpg?itok=LRuOLJtX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-knightling-announcement-bat.jpg?itok=mu4lKmH0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>has a rather sweet-looking&nbsp;art style.</figcaption></figure><p>Your main weapon in&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>is a shield, contrary to expectations; it seems that you won't be wielding a sword in this particular adventure.</p>
<p>However, your shield is a very capable combat asset. It'll let you "block, bash, parry, and create openings in your enemies' defenses", according to Twirlbound and Saber, so it should serve you more than well enough.</p>
<p>You can also use your shield as a traversal tool. The lands of Clesseia are vast, and you won't be able to get around just by walking from place to place, which is where&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>-style shield surfing comes into play.</p>
<p>If you want to get a feel for what&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>looks and plays like, then you can check out the game's debut trailer right here. It should be a treat if you're a fan of games like the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>

<p>Frankly,&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>looks exactly like the kind of game I wish there was more of, so I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one.</p>
<p>If you feel like you recognize&nbsp;Twirlbound's name, you might be remembering the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/twirlbound-launches-kickstarter-for-indie-game-pine">crowdfunding campaign the studio launched</a> for its previous game,&nbsp;<em>Pine</em>. It doesn't look like this one is seeking any extra funding, though.</p>
<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004254/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more info on this game as soon as we get it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-point-museum-lets-you-curate-your-very-own-historical-exhibits.952935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, the latest in the&nbsp;<em>Two Point&nbsp;</em>series of light-hearted management sims. You'll never guess what this one's all about!</p>
<p>Yes, as the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>will let you manage your very own arcade. Obviously, that's a joke; you're managing a museum, and it's up to you to curate the exhibits, design your museum's layout, and make sure your guests are having a good time.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/two-point-hospital">first</a> two <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/two-point-campus">games</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Two Point&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>will combine an irreverent sense of humor and a cartoony art style with management sim gameplay, but there are a few new twists on the formula.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/two-point-museum-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=P4oskIoH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/two-point-museum-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=nThfwPTm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fancy going digging for some dinosaur skeletons?</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will you have to run your museum, but you'll also have to source the exhibits yourself, so you'll be sending your experts out on far-flung missions to discover objects you can display for your guests' wonderment.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also have to keep your exhibits clean and safe for the guests, and you'll need to protect them from thieves as well, so you'd better make sure your security is top-notch.</p>
<p>Since this is a management sim, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that you can arrange and design your museum however you want; you can create themed areas built around certain exhibits, or you can just display everything willy-nilly, you crazy anarchist.</p>
<p>You can also arrange guided tours for your guests to go on, and the experts you've sent to gather fossils and other exhibits can lead those tours as well, which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>Guests in&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>can have a range of different interests and dispositions, and you'll have to keep them all happy if you want to succeed, even the children who put their grubby mitts all over your displays. The horror!</p>
<p><em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and while we don't have a release date yet, Sega and Two Point Studios have promised more info "soon". Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD launched its first Zen 5 desktop processors earlier this month, and tomorrow, it’s about to release what looks like a disappointing flagship Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. Early reviews of the initial Zen 5 CPUs — the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X — revealed a lack of performance improvements and efficiencies, and now reviews of the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X are coming to the same conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/43DFYvOoRhY">Hardware Unboxed has tested</a> a variety of productivity workloads and games with the 9950X, and the results make the previous generation Ryzen 9 7950X chip look like a better value in most cases. </p><p>Over a 13-game average running at 1080p with an RTX 4090, Hardware Unboxed found that the 9950X was just a single percent faster than the existing 7950X. AMD’s new flagship Zen 5 CPU is offering the same level of performance as two years ago, essentially. There are no real efficiency improvements on the power side, either. “From a gaming perspective, the 9950X is a complete and utter flop,” concludes Hardware Unboxed’s Steve Walton.</p><p>The 9950X is equally underwhelming on the productivity side, too. Hardware Unboxed found an actual regression in performance for compression and decompression work, and minor improvements over the 7950X in tests like Cinebench, Blender, and image editing in Photoshop. On average, the 9950X is just 3 percent faster than the 7950X during these productivity tests.</p><div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiyA9DRTJtyE">Steve Burke over at Gamers Nexus</a> has similar findings, concluding that the 7950X is better value for productivity workloads and that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">7800X3D that we reviewed last year</a> is still the better chip for gaming overall. </p></div><p>The results are a far cry from AMD’s big “monster” promises of performance gains in productivity as well as gaming. AMD described Zen 5 as a “big leap” it was “very proud of” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168544/amd-zen-5-ryzen-9-9950x-cpu-computex-2024">in a press briefing with <em>The Verge</em></a> earlier this year. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPkOoEPTqB-Q%26t%3D505s">JayzTwoCents says</a> AMD has “fumbled this launch,” and it’s hard not to disagree. At a time when Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs have been suffering from crashing issues leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211616/intel-crashing-13th-14th-gen-cpus-warranty-two-more-years">extended warranties</a>, many were looking to AMD’s new Zen 5 CPUs to offer up some solid competition for Intel. Now, it’s all eyes on Intel’s Arrow Lake desktop CPUs that are expected to launch later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And all of it is plugged into a single, comparatively small display so that he can swap between any system at any time. And it actually works. Guinness World Records <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.humix.com/video/k2-PQMOH4W2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.humix.com/video/k2-PQMOH4W2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently visited to make a video about his setup</a></span> and award him the rare achievement of having 444 consoles working through the same TV at the same time.</p><p>As the collector breaks down how the setup works, you can see how much planning and organization went into it all. A stack of switches and converters helps him route whichever system he wants to play to the TV with the flick of a button, while a massive Excel spreadsheet helps him keep track of what’s connected where.</p><p>This includes 30 RCA switchers and over 12 HDMI switchers running everything from a 1972 Magnavox Odyssey to last year’s PlayStation 5 Slim edition. The rest of the collection includes plug-and-play hardware like Namco joysticks and even off-brand systems that were quickly discontinued like the Super A’Can. To this day, though, Al-Nasser says his favorite console ever remains the Sega Genesis.</p><p>I think the thing I’m most impressed with about his setup is just how neat and tidy it is. Aside from the stacks of controllers that look more like modern art than mini-piles of mess, almost all of the cords are hidden. “I used all the tools available in the market in order to organize the cables,” he told Guinness. Al-Nasser said that while the idea was born from his retro gaming habits, the setup now functions as an unofficial museum. Hopefully, the Switch 2 comes out soon so he can make the record 445.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I played right from the beginning of chapter one for about three hours, and what surprised me most this time was how much I enjoyed the characters and story.</p><p>The adventure starts with Val and Hinna, a duo who grew up in the same town and have known each other for a long time. As they set off on their journey to the mana tree, a bit of time is spent on their relationship and the connection they’ve built over the years. Based on the townsfolk's comments, it is clear that the two have great chemistry together, and they know it. The duo doesn't even flinch at the idea of being a couple at one point, making me immediately ship them.  What made me like them even more is how down-to-earth and relatable they feel. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Visions of Mana Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Val serves as the aloof player-insert character who will ask questions that any player who is new to the series might also have. Hinna works opposite him perfectly, giving exposition in the form of conversations as the two travel toward the manna tree, explaining the setting and its background along the way. While this method of worldbuilding can feel forced, as if the characters are unnaturally dumping information on you, it works in Visions of Mana due to how they craft their character's backgrounds and personalities. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Having something presented on a platter in perfect order is much easier than finding everything yourself and figuring out what works best.</p></div><p>It is explained that Hinna knows all of the information because she's been preparing to be the alm of fire and traveling outside of their hometown for a while now, and the role must be knowledgeable. On the other hand, Val has been in the village honing his abilities as the best swordsman so he can serve as her soul guard on the journey. She is the brains, and he is the brawn. It might seem like a small thing, but it helps build both the characters and the world of Visions of Mana while establishing how they fit in their roles. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Careena and Morley also benefit a lot from getting origin stories. Instead of just being thrown together eight hours in with a pre-established dynamic like in the last preview, here I got to meet each character individually and learn why they are also on the journey to the mana tree. Initially, I didn't like Careena's sarcastic attitude or Morley's brooding nature. Given the context of the struggles they both go through just to become alms in this preview, these flaws make much more sense and even provide room for attractive personal growth as the story progresses. </p><p>Getting to experience combat, leveling, and abilities from the ground up made me even more appreciative of the RPG elements that go into Visions of Mana. Instead of having powers unlocked and pre-assigned, I was now responsible for finding, unlocking, and figuring out who to give them to. Again, this might sound simple, but having something presented on a platter in perfect order is much easier than finding everything yourself and figuring out what works best. Thankfully, it is a pretty straightforward process, although it is slow. Throughout Chapter One, I found sigil seeds by defeating enemies, completing quests, searching for chests, or buying them at traders with the in-game currency. Figuring out which sigils to assign to which character became its own game within a game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While I initially had issues fighting characters like the Blood Owls due to their speed, equipping the Thunders Saber to Val and Ice Smash to Careena made for the perfect one-two punch to slow it down and drain its health. Getting to assign these abilities myself instead of having them already given to the best character by the developers helped me better understand both the controlled and enemy character's strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>Now that I’ve experienced the early and middle parts of Visions of Mana, I simply can’t wait to sink my teeth into what the full game has to offer. The first preview showcased how good the combat and RPG elements are once they are established, and the second highlighted just how good the build-up is for the characters, setting, and ever-evolving tactics. Here is to hoping the story continues to develop as much as the gameplay does as the story reaches the later parts of the game. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Comparisons with the original game from 2015 can be seen below.</p><p>Perhaps most prominently, the remastered game features a reworked prologue, with adjustments to its narrative pacing. "We’ve given the Washingtons extra screen time to explore their close family bond and get to know them a little better," creative director Neil McEwan said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post. "We have also reframed some of the original scenes and developed the context around the infamous prank. We hope this enhances its emotional impact."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Until Dawn's updated version also has revised cinematography that uses a combination of fixed and over-the-shoulder camera views. "Blending the cinematography of the original with the introduction of a modern third-person camera, we hope to bring new life to characters and locations," McEwan said.</p><p>Myriad new accessibility and usability settings have also been added, as well as an alternative challenge to the Don't Move mechanic, which was a focal point of the original Until Dawn's criticism.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-announced-for-ps5-and-pc-alongside-a-release-window-state-of-play-2024">Until Dawn for PS5 and PC was announced in January 2024</a> as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-are-all-the-ps5-games">the latest in a long line of ports and remasters</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review">In our 7/10 review of the original</a>, IGN said: "Until Dawn is an inconsistent horror game, but it's still a heck of a lot of fun."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p dir="ltr">Most people probably have a couple of video game consoles hooked up to their TV. But Ibrahim Al-Nasser is not like most people. The Saudi Arabian has connected 444 systems to a single television, making him the Guinness World Records holder for the feat.</p><p dir="ltr">But how exactly are hundreds of consoles working on a single TV when most these days have only a few HDMI ports--let alone the fact old systems used different connections? According to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/8/gaming-is-serious-business-for-man-with-444-consoles-hooked-up-to-one-tv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records</a>, Ibrahim utilizes roughly 30 RC switchers, 12 HDMI switchers, and other devices. Additionally, he created an Excel spreadsheet to help navigate everything, which he shows off in a video (seen below) posted <a href="https://x.com/GWR/status/1823318344927195260" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Ibrahim has current-gen consoles like the PS5 connected to the TV, as well as 1972's Magnavox Odyssey. Other systems hooked up include Nintendo 64, Neo Geo, and Wii U. To get to 444, he also has plug-and-play devices and HDMI game sticks linked up to the TV, according to Guinness World Records.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what his favorite is, Ibrahim doesn't hesitate to say Sega Genesis. "For me, the best gaming console of all time, No. 1 always, forever, Sega Genesis," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">This is not the first time Guinness World Records has celebrated video games. In 2021, YouTuber and modder Gunnar Turnquist was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/behold-the-guinness-world-records-smallest-nintendo-64-console/1100-6488653/" data-ref-id="1100-6488653">honored for creating the world's smallest Nintendo 64</a>, for instance.

		<p>Two Point Studios and Sega have announced Two Point Museum, the next game in their irreverent management sim series. Two Point Museum is ‘coming soon’ for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Announcement Trailer (PEGI - ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oM5dGYAS-eY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>, Two Point Museum will try to tickle your dinosaur’s funny bone while getting you to manage and curate spectacular exhibits that fill museum goers with a sense of entertainment and wonder.</p>
<p>You might wonder how Two Point Studios are going to make museums weird and humorous, considering the real world counterparts, but you can immediately see from the announcement trailer how they’re going to go about things. Dinosaur skeletons and recreations have been given quirky designs and humorous expressions, there’s truly gigantic foot prints, and even prehistoric computers made out of rock.</p>
<p>You’ll have to go out and hunt for those relics, sending archeologists and explorers to undiscovered areas to find unusual relics to match the styles and rarity types for your museum. A new ‘endless’ star scoring system will keep you trying to tweak the museum layout and improve on previous collections that you curated, and that star rating will also rely on keeping staff and guests happy – organise guided tours for the latter with guides feeding visitors information and generating buzz that can lead to donations.</p>

<p>You’ll have to keep a keen eye for naughty types, with vandals, thieves and mischievous children all potentially up to no good, and certain items (like frozen cavemen) will have to be kept in the right temperature.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget the gift shop.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-launches-on-playstation-5-and-pc-october-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Until Dawn is one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-state-of-play-trailer-updated-characters-visuals/">most well-known games</a> created by Supermassive Games. It's time for the game to shine again. Released in 2015, it was a huge success for the PlayStation 4 and spurred Supermassive Games to make more games, such as The Quarry and The Dark Pictures Anthology. Now, it's time for Until Dawn to take the limelight again, as it's gotten an official release date for when it will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The story for Until Dawn will still be the same, but the game has been revamped massively to showcase the best cinematic experience of the game. To make the most of Until Dawn, the developers recreated the game in Unreal Engine 5, giving players access to a more intimate experience throughout the unfolding horrific events.</p>
<p>Using Unreal Engine 5, they have updated the character models and environments, improved visual effects and animations, and maximized the visual experience of Until Dawn for new and returning players. The developers spent much time on the character models, "bringing them in line with modern advances in character modeling and rendering," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says Neil McEwan</a>, the Creative Director of Ballistic Moon. Ballistic Moon is a British games studio that has helped with this massive project to deliver it in the Fall of 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Comparison Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bIkuM5y0Bjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To give Until Dawn an extra boost of realism, they added the injury mask system, which allows the characters in-game to look extra gritty. This system adds elements such as cuts, bruises, tears, and even snow to the characters for a more realistic finish.</p>
<p>Overall, the game looks to have a more polished experience with a new camera mechanic that will make navigating the game easier. Instead of the camera from before, players will now experience fixed shots and over-the-shoulder camera views so that fans can see the world of Until Dawn and give players brand new perspectives as they explore.</p>
<p>In addition to some fine-tuning narrative tweaks, they've also reworked their accessibility settings to help the game be more accessible and enjoyable to all horror fans. There is a new alternative to the "Don't Move" mechanic called "Stay Calm," which utilizes third-party peripherals that don't feature a gyroscope or for players who prefer a different challenge.</p>
<p>Until Dawn will be available for pre-order from August 21. It's important to note that if you want to play this game on a PC, you must have a PlayStation Network account to play the game. Until Dawn will be available on PC and PlayStation 5 on October 4.</p>

Your options are Maelstrom in Limsa Lominsa, Twin Adder in Gridania, and Immortal Flames in Ul’Dah. Your choice will have no bearing, as they all lead to a quest that unlocks Chocobos, however they do affect the next Main Scenario Quest (MSQ) with Maelstrom members receiving “Till Sea Swallows All,” Twin Adder members picking up “Woods Will Be Done,” and Immortal Flames members obtaining “For Coin and Country.”<br></p><p>Once these quests are completed, you can talk to each faction’s representative to accept a new Feature Quest titled “My Little Chocobo.” This is the quest that will reward a Chocobo on completion.</p><h2 id="h135486"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Complete My Little Chocobo</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-recommend-id="image://221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-recommend-id="image://221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are some small differences in how you complete “My Little Chocobo” depending on which Company you joined. Each variation will require you to obtain a Chocobo Issuance, which can be purchased from your Company’s shop using “Seals.” Seals are a type of currency issued by your Grand Company for completing different in-game tasks that can be used to buy exclusive items such as the key item for this quest.<br></p><p>It should be mentioned that the Seals used are exclusive to that company, so you cannot use the currency from Twin Adder to buy items from the Immortal Flames. Each Company’s shop should be right next to the quest giver for “My Little Chocobo.” Once it is obtained, you will have to present it to that region’s Chocokeep to receive your mount.

Remember that quest you completed earlier to unlock “My Little Chocobo”? It provided a reward of 300 seals from your respective Company, so you should have enough to pick up the Issuance and turn it in for a Chocobo! If you already spent it, the easiest way to grind for more is by participating in small combat events called FATEs, scattered around the world.</p><h2 id="h135488"><a id=""></a><strong>How Do I Summon My Chocobo?</strong></h2><p>You may have noticed that the reward for “My Little Chocobo” was not the bird itself, but a Chocobo Whistle. This is an item that needs to be used to actually register the mount to your character. To do so, navigate to your inventory and find the Chocobo Whistle. Select the “Use” Option. Now you will have a Chocobo ready to ride! Note that any mount you receive will be provided to you in this way, so if you are confused why a specific one you should have isn’t showing up in your Mount Options, check your inventory and make sure you used its corresponding item.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3cd0ea14cd44b95f2b72343fb222f47" data-recommend-id="image://d3cd0ea14cd44b95f2b72343fb222f47" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the menu tab.

Select the Chocobo Icon and select summon to bring it to the field. This action can also be set to your hotbar to summon instantly, and can be repeated for future mounts as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-recommend-id="image://074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mount list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The mount list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-recommend-id="image://074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mount list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a lot of running around in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so you are sure to get a lot of mileage out of your new ride. Just remember to save the Seals you obtain from the MSQ until you are able to trade them for a Chocobo Issuance, or else you may have to grind some out to obtain your giant bird. Also don’t panic if you don’t see your Chocobo when you finish the mission. You probably just need to blow the whistle and then you’re off to the races!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another studio has announced major layoffs as TerraTech developer Payload Studios has laid off 25 percent (25%) of its staff this week. The announcement comes via the studio’s founder and CEO Russ Clarke <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229083322172223488/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>“We tried very hard to avoid this, and I won’t pretend that we got everything right over the last few years – but ultimately the games market has been very tough in recent times, and shows little sign of getting easier,” he said. “Small independents like us have no protection from this, other than ‘nailing it’ every time, which is much easier said than done.”</p>



<p>While Clarke said that 25% of the team would be let go, there was no specific number mentioned. According to Rocket Reach, the company has 48 employees. If that’s accurate, at least 12 people will have lost their jobs from this news.</p>



<p>“Payload will carry on, and bounce back from this, I firmly believe; but it’s a hard road and it will stay hard for a good while longer,” Clarke continued. “TerraTech and TerraTech Worlds will continue to be maintained and developed without interruption – we thank our wonderful community for their support, and we wish the best to those amazing co-workers with whom we have shared this incredible journey, but must now regretfully part ways.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Payload Studios, the gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">over 11,600 people</a>, at least, lose their jobs in 2024 alone.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uRI3WOfER0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Sega announced Two Point Museum from developer Two Point Studios with a new cinematic and gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>The trailer did not confirm a release window or date, but it does conclude by saying the game is “coming soon.” The rating is still pending in today’s footage, so it may take a little while for the devs to offer concrete release details.</p>



<p>The new trailer also reveals Two Point Museum will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Fans can wishlist the game now.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The announcement trailer showcases a variety of new objects for the museum theme, concentrating on a range of dinosaur skeletons. </p>



<p>It also features Two Point Studios’ trademark sense of humor, calling 3-year-old computers ancient history and teasing zany antics.</p>



<p>The trailer description elaborates on the game, revealing that players will “coordinate experts on expeditions to uncover exciting artefacts.” </p>



<p>Players must also “strategically decorate and plan your exhibits” for guests, keep staff happy, secure donations, and more. </p>



<p>There are options to customize decorations, manage tours and pricing. Some of the in-game obstacles include thieves and carnivorous plants.</p>



<p>Most recently, Sega also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a new trademark</a> for “Yakuza Wars” last week. Fans quickly speculated that Sega could be planning on a major announcement for the mystery project during September’s anticipated Tokyo Game Show.</p>

When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their adventure, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for.

		<p>Developer Pixelatom&nbsp;and publisher&nbsp;Blowfish Studios have announced that Anarkade, a platform fighter, will be available from September 23rd on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anarkade - Coming 23rd September | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejUkOamlck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Anarkade&nbsp;is a fun, fast-paced party game at heart,”</em> said Javier Arias, Founder and Lead Developer, Pixelatom. <em>“We’ve crafted a balanced experience, mixing action, shooting, and platforming with unpredictable scenarios that make for an dynamic, ever changing experience for shooters to play over and over again.”</em></p>
<p>Anarkade will feature six different stages with each of them having their own hazards and quirks. For example, in the Space stage the battle wills be fought in low gravity, while ice stages have slippery surfaces. The layouts will change as each is procedurally generated. There will be various weapons available to use in the fights too including a knife, Python revolver, the gatling gun, and the bowling bomb. At the start of each fight, players will be randomly assigned their weapons and will have to fight to grab crates to change weapons.&nbsp;Anarkade will feature both local and online multiplayer. Game modes will include single matches, or tournament matches that include Deathmatches and collecting loot in Cratebox.</p>

					<p>I didn't know what to expect when I first booted up the game. I went in without knowing it and didn't even look it up on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/721180/Dustborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. I installed Dustborn, developed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/dustborn-qa-red-threads-first-attempt-at-action-adventure/">Red Thread Games</a> and got stuck in. However, after some time playing the game, it felt familiar.</p>
<p>For a while, I couldn't place my finger on what felt so familiar about Dustborn until I realized that it reminded me of the Telltale games, specifically Tales from the Borderlands. The characters had the same kooky vibes as those of Tales from the Borderlands.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I also found it similar to a Telltale game was the art style. It carried the same comic book aesthetic, one of the biggest factors that drew me into Dustborn. While the art style was similar, Dustborn has a more authentic comic-book feel, which I loved as someone who avidly reads comic books.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dustborn-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Off the bat, the game is incredibly accessible. While it did tell me to play with a controller, I decided to forgo the warning and use a mouse and keyboard. Even then, I found the game perfectly playable. My only issue was that I couldn't change the keybinds, which I do in every game for the optimal experience. For those who need subtitles, there was the option to stack the subtitles and have different colors for character subtitles, making it easier to digest the conversation.</p>
<p>If, like me, you sometimes miss crucial dialogue, accessing the menu shows you the full dialogue on the right-hand side, which I loved as a feature. Additionally, for those who struggle with QTEs (Quick-Time Events), there was the option for simplified QTEs.</p>
<p>The game opens with a scene introducing the four main characters in a car. In the driver's seat, there is Sai, with pigtails and vitiligo, who is freaking out about the cargo that they have picked up. Sai is very explosive, her moods changing with a drop of the hat. With how dramatic she is, she quickly became my least favorite. Then there are the two passengers in the back: A non-binary person named Noam with silver hair and a masculine Latino named Theo. Along the way, you are introduced to other important characters, like a sweet lady named Luna, who is working on getting you to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>You play as the protagonist, Pax, a black woman with powers who can utilize them to manipulate language and saves her and her team a fair few times. She gets tired of their bickering and utilizes her powers to "block" them, stopping them from talking entirely until she releases them. Her ability to have powers makes her someone who is called Anomal. In addition, Noam's powers gaslight people and make them feel a certain way. Pax has a bullet wound, and Noam manages to gaslight her to make her feel okay again. Then there is Sai, whose powers turn her into stone. Which proves to be mildly problematic throughout the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ss_dc5d02bbec90aa90fcf5eebb3c2279ae067f6166-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Pax has been hired to deliver a very important package from Pacifica to Nova Scotia, a long and troublesome journey. In addition, you get to see every inner thought that Pax has; through this, you see her refer to herself as a "kid." It quickly becomes apparent that she isn't on about herself and is pregnant, which is a huge secret she is hiding from the others.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I wasn't confident in their abilities when I was first introduced to the ragtag team. While I swear like a soldier, I felt that the amount of swearing from Sai was unnecessary, making the opening cutscene long and tedious. The other characters were incredibly likable, with Noam quickly becoming my favorite. One of the main things that I found incredibly bizarre in the prologue of Dustborn was the rhythm mini-game. It felt incredibly out of place, and I wasn't sure if that was what I would expect from the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Once the prologue was over, I found the experience much more enjoyable. There was space to explore and connect with others and enemies to battle. However, during cutscenes where Pax was in charge of making decisions, I often found myself irritated by Sai's passive-aggressive rebuttals. They all comment on Sai being emotionally charged, which becomes evident quickly.</p>
<p>Dustborn is a politically charged game where you deliver "supplies" across the border. These include pamphlets, manifestos, and books banned from libraries in the American Republic, a fascist state that has outlawed all politics that oppose their views. During a specific scene where Pax is confronted with the "tree in the stillness," she hears politically charged whispers from the far-right, talking about how scientists lie to people and are putting things in the vaccines. From this scene alone, it became clear that Dustborn is a metaphor for everything happening in the real world, and I was here for it.</p>
<p>My one gripe with this game is how long it takes to get into the nitty-gritty. While the prologue is intense and dramatic from the outset, after that initial cutscene, it slows down. Many of the conversations are bonding sessions where Pax is trying to navigate her relationships with the other crew members.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, many words were either bolded or capitalized to provide emphasis. Even now, I am still confused about what some words mean or whether they are just alternative words used to describe things. For example, I see Anomal's powers described as "Words," "Vox," and then the other character-specific terms, such as "Block" and "Trigger," for Pax.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ss_99a0bcba5ecbf6bf151e4948229c245a6fdaecf6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Music is also important in the game, with mini rhythm games throughout. I found this quite bizarre and wasn't sure what this added. While your cover is part of a Punk Rock band, with all of you playing different instruments, it still felt peculiar and out of place.</p>
<p>The story and interactions were the most fun parts of the game. However, I didn't mesh with the combat system and found it a little lacking. While there was the opportunity for fun combos and using your powers to make the fight easier, it wasn't what I wanted from the combat system.</p>
<p>Overall, I did enjoy my time with Dustborn. It wasn't at all what I expected, but it was a lot of fun, even if I did have some minor gripes on the personality of a particular character.</p>
<p><em>Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher).</em></p>

					
					

<p>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were&nbsp;some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-has-reportedly-already-made-over-600m-this-year.952815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Valve's immensely popular multiplayer shooter&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has already made a staggering amount of money in 2024, and the year is nowhere near done yet.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-steam-games-won-the-first-half" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless</a>,&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>racked up an astonishing $610 million in the first half of 2024. It's not hard to imagine the game breaking a billion dollars in revenue before the year is through.</p>
<p>It's a pretty big leap from&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>to the next game on GameDiscoverCo's list,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, which racked up "just" $458 million. An impressive number by any metric, but it probably could have been even higher if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">that whole PlayStation ID debacle</a> hadn't happened.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-revenue-report-shooting.jpg?itok=4FK7N0H8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-revenue-report-shooting.jpg?itok=G2HS7bMU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>is big business for Valve, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>It's another fairly big leap from&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s $378 million, which secures it a bronze medal, with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>&nbsp;</em>bringing up fourth and fifth with $276 million and $159 million, respectively.</p>
<p>The first single-player game (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/baldurs-gate-3-multiplayer-coop">does also support multiplayer</a>) on the list is&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, which raked in $127 million for the first half of 2024. That's not bad at all considering it was released last year.</p>
<p>Predictably enough,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2&nbsp;</em>is in seventh place with $119 million, although&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragons-dogma-2"><em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em></a>'s eighth-place $108 million finish is something of a surprise, especially given that it's beaten&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, which sits in ninth with $100 million.</p>
<p>Finally, rounding out the top ten spot is&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, which made $91 million in the first half of the year. That's probably not going to serve as much of a balm to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">200-plus staff let go from developer Bungie</a> last month, though.</p>

<ul><li>11.&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;- $56 million</li>
<li>12.&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>- $54 million</li>
<li>13.&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>- $49 million</li>
<li>14.&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>&nbsp;- $48 million</li>
<li>15.&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut&nbsp;</em>- $48 million</li>
<li>16.&nbsp;<em>Warframe&nbsp;</em>- $46 million</li>
<li>17.&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty HQ&nbsp;</em>- $41 million</li>
<li>18.&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>- $40 million</li>
<li>19.&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>- $40 million</li>
<li>20.&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>- $36 million</li>
</ul><h2>Steam is also cracking down on link spam in store descriptions</h2>
<p>Elsewhere in Steam news, Valve has also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed a new set of changes</a> coming to Steam store page descriptions in order to combat excessive link spam.</p>
<p>The changes essentially limit what it's possible to include in a Steam game's store page description; publishers will no longer be able to include links to other websites, for instance, nor will they be able to include "embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons".</p>
<p>Also prohibited are "images, links, or widgets pointing to other games on Steam". Starting from early September, an update for Steam will be rolled out that will hide instances of URLs being included in games' descriptions or "other text section[s]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-store-page-descriptions-forest-ranger-simulator.jpg?itok=NTy6kvgo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-store-page-descriptions-forest-ranger-simulator.jpg?itok=IznvoH7t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be seeing less of this sort of thing.</figcaption></figure><p>Valve says it doesn't like "store pages linking prominently off to other store pages", and that the changes are also intended to nudge publishers towards using Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos">new demo features</a> rather than releasing a separate "Prologue" for their games and linking to the main game from that prologue's store page.</p>
<p>You're unlikely to notice a huge amount of changes when this new Steam update drops, but it should at least make navigating Steam a bit easier. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Out December 13, <em>Kraven the Hunter</em>’s latest trailer also introduces us to the titular anti-hero’s gangster dad played by Russell Crowe. </p><p>Take a look:</p><p>As Johnny Cash sings in the background, we see Kraven doing all of his hunter things, from dodging bear traps and knifing guys in the leg to running on all fours like he just finished watching James McAvoy in <em>Glass</em>. The trailer also sets up Rhino as the big bad, described as an animal “stronger than you can imagine.” It ends with the two fighting out in a valley amid a stampede of water buffalo. </p><p> <em>Kraven’s Last Hunt</em> is considered to be one of the top comic book arcs in Marvel’s repertoire, but with no Spider-Man to pull on, Sony’s origin story for Kraven, who was also featured in last year’s PlayStation 5 hit S<em>pider-Man 2, </em>appears to be going more for an action movie revenge flick vibe in the vein of <em>John Wick</em> or <em>The Equalizer</em>. Whether it can actually succeed on its own merits is the big question. The first <em>Venom </em>aside, Sony’s recent Spider-Man B-sides track record has been full of major misses like <em>Morbius </em>and <em>Madame Web</em>. </p><p>One thing Sony clearly does want audiences to know is that <em>Kraven the Hunter</em> won’t be shying away from brutal violence. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-box-office-flop-bomb-2024-gearbox-1851619588&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-box-office-flop-bomb-2024-gearbox-1851619588">Given <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>’s recent $1 billion box office blowout</a></span>, shattering records for R-rated movies, it’s a strategy that makes sense. At the same time, it’s going to take a lot more than a few decapitations to purge Sony’s current comic book movie malaise. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>An ambitious-sounding Call of Duty mod is coming this week, ushering in what its developers describe as a recreation of the original Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer experience "with new twists." Some fans, however, are concerned that <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fans-fear-h2m-mod-will-get-shut-down-as-sales-skyrocket-2860448/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision will step in and shut the whole thing down</a> like it did with the <a href="https://x.com/sm2game/status/1658745182819598337" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fan-made Call of Duty SM2 mod in 2023.</a></p><p>The mod is for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, and it includes numerous maps (50+ in total), an updated progression system, more camos, and custom attachments. The killstreaks you remember from Modern Warfare 2 are in the mod, too.</p><p>There is a lot of excitement and hype around this mod, in part because 2020's Modern Warfare II Remastered was campaign-only and did not include any multiplayer support. At the time, Activision's explanation for why it didn't release a multiplayer experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-cod-modern-warfare-2-remastered-lacks-multipla/1100-6475496/" data-ref-id="1100-6475496">left a lot of people shaking their heads and trying to understand.</a> And now, Call of Duty fans are taking matters into their own hands and doing it themselves.</p><p>The H2M mod, as it's called, requires a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, which was originally released in 2017. The mod launcher will arrive on August 16.</p><p>To install H2M-Mod, you will need to own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. Presumably due to the great anticipation for the mod's release, Modern Warfare Remastered has surged up the sales charts and currently sits at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers&amp;os=win" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 overall on Steam's top-sellers chart.</a> Black Ops 6, the next entry in the series that's due out this October, is No. 15, for comparison.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VwBEmMPxuRU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The H2M mod includes all the Modern Warfare Remastered maps, as well as original MW2 maps that the community creators brought forward. Additionally, some of the campaign play spaces from the MW2 Campaign Remastered release are playable in the mod as custom maps.</p><p>As for progression, the modders said there will be 70 ranks to make your way through and 10 prestige levels. After prestige 10, players can work their way up to level 1000.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision will reveal what's next for Black Ops 6 during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28. Shortly after that, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta begins on August 30.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-trailer-reveals-beetlejuice-gameplay-august-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-trailer-reveals-beetlejuice-gameplay-august-release-date.952776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-trailer-reveals-beetlejuice-gameplay-august-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzwdhdoaPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Player First Games revealed new MultiVersus gameplay featuring Beetlejuice and confirmed they will join the roster on August 20, 2024.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases some of Beetlejuice’s kit as an Assassin class fighter, an archetype that only offers a few other characters like Arya Stark and Marvin the Martian. It also reveals new voice lines, interactions, and potential cosmetics. </p>



<p>The new trailer closes with a brief nod to Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the upcoming movie sequel. Director Tim Burton returns for the film, which premieres in early September this year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Beetlejuice “What’s My Name” Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hzwdhdoaPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Today’s announcement for August follows just a month after leaker AusilMV claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leak-teases-beetlejuice-is-possibly-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus could add Beetlejuice</a> sometime soon. </p>



<p>That lends more validity to AusilMV’s previous leaks from May 2024, which teased even more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leaks-tease-possible-new-characters-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential characters and stages</a>. They claimed they found these additions by datamining the game.</p>



<p>Beetlejuice’s moveset features a variety of thematic abilities, like falling into a coffin or transforming hands into a weapon. Most notably, that also includes the addition of the sandworm, iconic enough to be worked into the popcorn bucket merch for the upcoming film.</p>



<p>Late last July, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially acquired</a> MultiVersus developer Player First Games. The developer’s co-founder Tony Huynh said that “having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”</p>
