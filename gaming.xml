<p>Version 1.9.8 <a href="https://claphanz.com/en/news/nintendo_switch_easy_come_easy_golf_ver198_update.html">arrived earlier today</a> and includes a caddy's worth of improvements for load times, grid display, and 1080p support for the larger Switch 2 screen.</p>
<p>Plus the game, which ran at 30fps on the original Switch back when we reviewed it in 2022, will now let you choos between a 30 and 60fps mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hnwxvk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The timing of this update is a little curious, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, a brand new game in the Everybody's Golf series, comes out on Switch on 5th September (4th in Japan). We've even got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/everybodys-golf-hot-shots">a review up for that today</a>. Is Clap Hanz taking a Hot Shot at Hot Shots...? (Please don't give us a Double Bogie).</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the patch notes straight from Clap Hanz's website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ver. 1.9.8 of "Easy Come Easy Golf" was released.<br>
The content of the latest update is listed below.<br>
- Improved load times<br>
- Improved grid display<br>
- Reorganized home screen menu into a single page<br>
- Adjusted Triple Tap spin input<br>
- Improved Triple Tap gauge UI<br>
- Frame rate selection (30fps/60fps)<br>
You can also play at 60fps on Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you fancy a shot at Easy Come Easy Golf, then we rather enjoyed it back when it released on Switch, scoring it an 8/10. Now with smoother performance and an updated resolution for Switch 2, there's no better time to try it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Rivals is currently only available on the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but as of next week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-marvel-go-ahead-to-make-original-marve-rivals-characters-director-says-stay-tuned/">NetEase</a> has announced that it'll drop onto last-gen consoles with its arrival on PS4 alongside the release of the game's Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon on September 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes with a new cinematic trailer for Season 4, which lists the PS4 alongside the rest of its platforms at the end of the trailer. Unfortunately for Xbox One players, they're currently left out of the fun, though that could change with a similarly surprising announcement in a future Marvel Rivals update. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">most popular games this year</a> after its arrival in December 2024, and its arrival on PS4 could potentially see another peak to its popularity that just wasn't possible on current-gen only consoles, especially when considering the fact that it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nearly-five-years-into-the-ps5-generation-there-are-more-players-on-ps5-monthly-than-ps4-sony-confirms/">only this past June</a> when Sony was able to confirm that there were more PS5 players active on a monthly basis than PS4 players. Even major games like Genshin Impact are <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">only starting to wind down their PS4 support now</a>.</p>



<p>The PS4 may be a last-gen console, but there are still millions of players who, for one reason or another, have not yet upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series console and jumped into the current-gen. </p>

As such, you'll want to make informed decisions throughout your journey to ensure your health, inventory, and weapons are all able to withstand what the game throws at you.</p><p>While you'll start to obtain more of both materials in the back half of the game, the opening hours can often feel restrictive, forcing you to make very tough decisions about what upgrades will improve your chances of success. Below, we'll list out the best early upgrades we think you should go with to feel confident in taking on the challenges ahead.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_to_know_about_upgrade_materials_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">What to know about upgrade materials in Cronos: The New Dawn</a></li><li><a href="#Best_upgrades_to_buy_first_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">Best upgrades to buy first in Cronos: The New Dawn</a><ul><li><a href="#Temporal_Shell___Inventory_Slots_and_Suit_Integrity">Temporal Shell - Inventory Slots and Suit Integrity</a></li><li><a href="#Sword_MK_1615__Handgun____Stability_and_Charge_Speed">Sword MK-1615 (Handgun) - Stability and Charge Speed</a></li><li><a href="#Hammer_PROV_2030__Shotgun____Firepower_and_Charge_Speed">Hammer PROV-2030 (Shotgun) - Firepower and Charge Speed</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="What_to_know_about_upgrade_materials_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">What to know about upgrade materials in Cronos: The New Dawn</h2><p>There are two types of upgrade materials: Energy and Cores.</p><p>Energy is used to upgrade your weapons. It's plentiful throughout the game, usually sitting on shelves or other places where you might find items, though it will also sometimes drop from defeated enemies.</p><p>Cores, meanwhile, are used to level up your suit (health and inventory space), as well as your Torch Fuel and Pyre items. These are rare and typically found by seeking out optional paths--such as through chainlocked doors--or by petting cats that are hiding in the world.</p><h2 id="Best_upgrades_to_buy_first_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">Best upgrades to buy first in Cronos: The New Dawn</h2><p>Here are the best upgrades to focus on first in Cronos: The New Dawn.</p><h3 id="Temporal_Shell___Inventory_Slots_and_Suit_Integrity">Temporal Shell - Inventory Slots and Suit Integrity</h3><p>Cronos: The New Dawn is very stingy with inventory space, so managing it properly can be a very stressful experience. Is it worth dropping some much-needed ammo to carry a vintage item you found that can be sold back in a safe room for a big chunk of Energy? Should you carry more healing items, or bring along the bolt cutters you found a bit ago that can help you open chainlocked doors?</p><p>It's a lot to think about, but it can be made much easier by investing in Inventory Slot upgrades early so that you can carry some extra items. However, you'll also need to worry about your health, especially in the opening hours when you're coming to grips with how the game plays and may be making more mistakes. As such, it's a good idea to use some Cores to upgrade your Suit Integrity early on, too.</p><p>So, how do you decide which to upgrade? Your best bet in the first half of the game is to switch between the two each time you have enough Cores for an upgrade. Once you fill in the fourth Suit Integrity slot and have your health to 200, you should probably go all-in on Inventory Slots until it's maxed out. The back half of the game is overflowing with stuff to pick up, as well as additional weapons that you'll want to bring with you, so you'll be thankful to have more space for them all.</p><h3 id="Sword_MK_1615__Handgun____Stability_and_Charge_Speed">Sword MK-1615 (Handgun) - Stability and Charge Speed</h3><p>You may be inclined to start with Firepower upgrades for the Sword MK-1615, but since most normal enemies will take between 1-3 headshots from this handgun either way, upgrading its damage is less important than with the shotgun (as we'll discuss below). Besides, more damage is irrelevant if your bullets don't hit their target, meaning your best bet is usually going to be to toss at least a few upgrades into Stability. This will reduce the wobbly aiming and make it easier to re-center after taking shots.</p><p>Speaking of taking shots with the handgun, you'll want to make sure you're charging each shot you take to do maximum damage. So, investing into Charge Speed can make a huge difference when enemies are closing in on you rapidly, allowing you to get your shots out quicker and reposition when needed.</p><h3 id="Hammer_PROV_2030__Shotgun____Firepower_and_Charge_Speed">Hammer PROV-2030 (Shotgun) - Firepower and Charge Speed</h3><p>The shotgun is your true heavy hitter throughout much of the game. Unlike the handgun, which benefits less from Firepower, you'll want to pump up the shotgun's Firepower stat as much as possible. This makes it an immensely deadly weapon against bosses, as well as well as a useful tool for herding enemies into a group and downing them all with a single blast.</p><p>Because you'll be using this against difficult bosses and hordes of foes, it's also imperative that you level up its Charge Speed as much as possible. Even with points invested, it can take quite a while to charge up, but every little bit of time saved is still time you're not vulnerable to enemy attacks.</p>

            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we are just a mere matter of minutes away from IOI's 007: First Light presentation.</p>
<p>Things are set to kick off at 7pm UK time, and as a bit (a lot) of a Bond fan, I will be watching along. Please, join me here to chat about what we see (will there be a PPK on show? Oh, or a martini or two?). IOI previously teased car chases, stealth sequences, and some shootouts, which sounds promising.</p>
<p>What are you hoping to see during this evening's Bond showcase?</p>

      <div><p>Beadle &amp; Grimm have launched a new crowdfunding success. Their new project is <em>Skullduggery</em>, an urban fantasy supplement for the latest edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, and it reached its initial funding goal in just 17 minutes.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skullduggery</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beadleandgrimms/skullduggery-urban-adventures-5e/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Skullduggery</em></a> is the newest project by Beadle &amp; Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse. As mentioned above, the supplement contains new city-themed character options. These include new subclasses, backgrounds, species, feats, spells and equipment, all designed for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset.</p>

The Path of Metamorphosis Barbarian amplifies their body with experimental alchemy. The Grim Reaper Patron Warlock lets casters make a literal deal with Death. The Circle of Vermin Druid provides one command of creatures that scurry in a city's cracks. The list goes on.</p>

<p>As for the new species, <em>Skullduggery</em> leans into the macabre and strange. The new Forsaken species is a mortal tainted by necrotic energies, existing in a state between life and death. Alternatively, there is the Mycelium, fungal plant creatures drawn to the city, searching for their wayward god.</p>

<p><em>Skullduggery</em> also contains tools for DMs. It includes city establishment, organization rules, and a swath of prewritten locations, characters, and groups. These are vital for DMs wanting to run a campaign set in city streets and dubious alleyways. intrigue, deadly poison, and duplicitous guilds. In addition, the book contains a prewritten adventure, <em>The Oppression of Blood</em>, which will take players from levels 1-9.</p>

<p>This volume of content is not unexpected for Beadle &amp; Grimm. The company has a reputation for creating bespoke, premium boxed versions of different fantasy campaigns like <em>Curse of Strahd</em> or <em>Pathfinder's</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/absalom-city-of-omens-gold-edition-brings-premium-pathfinder-thrills" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Absalom, City of Omens</em></a>.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Skullduggery</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Burnt Haze for $25:</strong> A PDF copy of the main book and all stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>VTT Bundle for $40:</strong> The adventure module, tokens, maps, Compendiums, and add-ons, all on Roll20</li>

	<li><strong>All In for $375:</strong> Everything in the Night Market Tier, all add-ons, all stretch goals, VTT bundle, and Founder Signatures</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Skullduggery</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$163,225, more than six times its initial funding goal of $25,000. The campaign ends September 19th.</span></span></p>

The new ratings will appear thanks to Roblox’s new partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), which was announced today.</p><p>As part of the partnership, players in other countries will see age ratings from the ratings agency for their region. Right now, Roblox uses its own <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">“content maturity labels”</a> to indicate maturity level of experiences, but these will be replaced with ratings from the agencies in the future.</p><p>“With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live,” Patricia Vance, president of the ESRB and chairperson of IARC, says in a statement. “The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.”</p><p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">also announced</a> a plan to, by the end of the year, require all users who use any of its communication features to have their age estimated by the platform. Right now, users older than 9 can communicate via Roblox’s in-game, filtered chat without going through the age estimation process. The age estimation will rely on “a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification, and verified parental consent,” Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman says in a blog post.</p><p>The platform has come under significant scrutiny over its child safety practices, with the state of Louisiana suing Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">in August</a> for allegedly creating an environment where “child predators thrive.” These new child safety features announced today build on other recent changes like Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification">locking down sexual content</a> and adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">improved parental controls</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation]]></content:encoded>

<p>You've got a bit of time to do so as well, with that November 12th release still being a little while away. It's not like there are any other big  metroidvaniascoming out in the interim to scratch that itch for you. As far as what you're in for goes, here's Tombwater's story blurb:</p>
<blockquote>Enter Tombwater, where shadows lurk and whispers echo from the deep of abandoned silver mines. This is no longer a town where people live, but a town where people die. A once-thriving community, its people have now been gripped by the tendrils of madness. Step into the well-worn boots of a lone gunslinger, drawn to the eerie, decaying streets by the disappearance of Sheriff Elliott Flintwood — a long-lost friend who’s fought to save the town. Uncover the truth by facing unforgettable terrors and fighting through the madness.</blockquote>
<p>There you go, not-Clint-Eastwood's nowhere to be found, get your bum in some chaps and go fight some eldrich horrors. Those horrors, glimpsed from the game's top-down 2D perspective look pretty freaky too. The deputy's covered in red stuff and bones, and over 20 other boss battles are promised as you explore the likes of canyons and mines with some secrets tucked away.</p><p>I'm a bit bemused at a western being as proud to boast melee weapons, spells and tonic brewing as it is a bunch of pistols, shotguns and repeaters you can use to duel demonic dudes to death, but variety is the spice of life. Well, having someone spit chewing tobacco into your lunch was probably the spice of wild west life, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can check out Tombwater's demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3308200/Tombwater/">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-things-we-just-learned-about-the-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster.1287822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s unclear exactly how big the audience is for an exceedingly faithful remaster of an RPG spin-off that came out over 25 years ago, even if it does have <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the name and is one of the best games ever made. But those who fell in love with <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> once they discovered it and have been obsessing about it ever since care very much about the upcoming <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, especially what it will or won’t change about the original, and what it might mean for a potential sequel all these years later.</p> <p>You can find <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-ivalice-demo-hands-on-changes-2000622300">my thoughts on what I played</a> of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics – The Ivalice Chronicles</em> recently behind closed doors at PAX West 2025, but a recent barrage of interviews with the development team has provided some more clues about what fans can expect from the overhaul. The game isn’t out until September 30, but the director of the project has already been tipping his hand about some big questions I’ve had, including how the remaster approaches <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ most broken characters.</p> <h2>Orlandeau Thunder God Cid will still be OP</h2> <p>Every<em> Final Fantasy</em> has a Cid, and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ is by far the most broken. He joins your party late into the game and comes with a full suite of magic sword abilities with no charge time that do incredible damage. He also arrives equipped with Excalibur, which auto-casts Haste on the user. He’s a wrecking ball that trivializes every fight, which is why I have a strict rule against ever using him.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If we remaster it, what do you think about whether it is better to weaken " The Thunder God Cid", who was accused of destroying the balance&nbsp;?</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1664069034579759104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It sounds like he will still be that way. “We haven’t made any changes to characters that were powerful,” director Kazutoyo Maehiro <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-devs-havent-made-any-changes-to-characters-that-were-powerful-because-they-didnt-really-want-to-disappoint-og-fans-with-nerfs/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. “And similarly, not just for the unique characters, but for jobs such as the arithmetician, we haven’t made any major changes.” While some classes like Archer have been buffed, the team wanted to avoid players experiencing any moments of “your favorite job got nerfed.”</p> <h2><em>FF7</em>‘s Cloud won’t suck so much when you first get him</h2> <p>The <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> protagonist has an unusual cameo in <em>Tactics,</em> where he not only appears in the world but can be recruited and used in battle. I won’t get into the story details that explain Cloud’s arrival, but in the original game he’s kind of a pain to use, at least until you finish his side quest. That’s changing for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>.</p>

 <p>“We’ve made it so that his stats are adjusted a little bit. On top of that, he will come equipped with the Materia Blade when he joins your party initially,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">told <em>Inverse</em></a>. “So in terms of usability of him as a character, it will be much more approachable than it was in the original.” Players will also be able to recruit him earlier in the remaster, starting in chapter 4. It remains to be seen if the charging time and attack power on his Limit command will get the buffs they deserve.</p> <h2>The Wiegraf boss fight isn’t easier, but it won’t break your save file</h2> <p>Wiegraf is one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ most tragic characters and most difficult enemies. Most first-time players are completely unprepared for the unique one-on-one fight with the ex-revolutionary that the game throws them into without warning about halfway through. Worse still, in the original game, the encounter happens inside a castle, wedged between two other encounters with no opportunity to go grind on the world map if you’re having trouble. Without a backup save, a playthrough can grind to a complete halt this way.</p>

 <p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> doesn’t make Wiegraf easier, but it does offer a new option to back out of the fight if you’re having trouble. “We have the ability to retry battle, or when you’re doing consecutive battles, you can actually back out to the world map,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">told <em>Inverse</em></a>. “We have those types of features for accessibility and ease of play.” Players can also switch to the easy mode if they’re having too much trouble, or they can exploit one of the many strategies fans have come up with over the years to make easy work of Wiegraf and his OP holy sword attacks (including a glitch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/196bg6h/wiegraf_fight_yeah_you_know/">that’s still in the new version</a>).</p> <h2>Genji armor stealing is back in a day-one patch due to popular demand</h2> <p>Another big fight in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is against Marquis Elmdore in the Limberry Castle. One of the things that’s unique about it is that Elmdore has a full set of Genji samurai gear that appears nowhere else in the game. Diligent players can spend the entire battle trying to steal it from him but it’s very difficult because, among other things, Elmdore has an ability that reduces the success rate below 20 percent unless you spend a lot of time debuffing him.</p>

 <p>Stealing the armor was only possible in the U.S. version of the original game, not the Japanese version or the later <em>War of the Lions</em> port that was based on it. The option is coming back for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, though. “In interviews when the game was announced, we received a lot of feedback from fans both in Japan and overseas saying, ‘I wish we could steal Genji equipment,'” Maehiro <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/51058">told <em>Famitsu</em></a>. “Matsuno, the director of the original version, also mentioned the same thing, so we decided to make it possible to steal in the Enhanced Version. This will be reflected in a patch on the release date, so please connect online and apply the patch.”</p> <h2>The Time Mage’s all-powerful Teleport skill now costs 3,000 JP to unlock</h2> <p>This one cuts me to my core. Teleport is one of the best skills in the game, and you can have a character learn it very early as long as you grind for job points to unlock it in a couple of battles. It lets a character try to move anywhere on the battlefield, but the farther the square is from their current location, the lower the probability of success. On levels divided by castle walls or other difficult terrain, however, it makes it easy to dominate the battlefield.</p>

 <p>In the original game, the skill only costs 600 JP. It’s a steal. Not so in the remaster. <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-kazutoyo-maehiro-interview/">As pointed out by <em>RPGFan</em></a>, the skill now costs 3,000 JP to unlock. That’s going to be a whole lot of characters standing around attacking one another before a battle ends to grind for points. At least this way, finally obtaining the skill will feel a little less easy-mode.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> could still get (another) sequel</h2> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is far from the only strategy RPG Square Enix has released, even in recent years. There were two spin-offs on Game Boy Advance back in the 2000s and more recently, the spiritual successor, <em>Triangle Strategy,</em> which is to <em>Tactics</em> what <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. But for some fans, none of these games ever hit the way the original did and they’re still pining for some cosmic convergence that captures tactical-RPG lightning in a bottle a second time.</p> <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/final-fantasy-tactics-refresh/">told<em> Wired</em></a>. Though he can’t make any promises, there’s apparently a possibility <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> could get additional new content in a future update if the game sells well enough. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2's</a> massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">The Third Edict update</a> is getting even better, as a patch scheduled for later this week will bring improvements not only to the game's first seasonal league but also to new mechanics like sprint.</p><p dir="ltr">The Third Edict launched August 29 and added Act IV of Path of Exile 2's campaign, two temporary "interlude" acts to help players reach the endgame, and the ARPG's first seasonal league, Rise of the Abyssal. Developer Grinding Gear Games says it's been keeping a close eye on player feedback since the update's launch, and now it's almost ready to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490?emclan=103582791474292391&amp;emgid=521975626158047245" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch 0.3.0b</a> to address various issues.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXLzXS4I2ak" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zXLzXS4I2ak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Many of the upcoming changes are to Rise of the Abyssal, making the abilities of certain enemies more manageable. That includes the Vessel of Kulemak boss. It will be easier to read and dodge its arena-wide cleave attack, and while its Teleport Slam ability can no longer be avoided, it will deal reduced damage. Other enemies, like Abyssal Stranglers and the Shepherd of the Pit, have had the damage dealt by certain abilities reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the overall game, there are tons of little improvements, including changes to many areas and enemies in Act IV. Certain bosses like The Scourge of the Skies, Kurtog, and the Great White One will have more abilities that can't be avoided. Other bosses will become a little more manageable thanks to improved telegraphing of Yama the White's Future Sight skill and increased cooldown between Torvian, Hand of the Saviour's skills. In the case of Torvian, the projectile speed of their bouncing axes will be reduced and they'll deal less freeze build-up. Another enemy, Quill Crabs, will additionally deal less damage.</p><p dir="ltr">One mechanic that is being slightly tweaked is the game's new sprint function, which allows players to come out of a roll in a run in order to more quickly navigate maps or flee from enemies. Players found they would still be locked on to enemies while sprinting, resulting in their character unintentionally turning around when casting an ability. With patch 0.3.0b, sprinting will make it so players are no longer locked onto enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will also address a whole lot of bugs, including one that was causing the Warbringer's Answered Call Notable Passive to not summon Ancestral Spirit minions properly. It will also fix various instances that would cause the client to crash.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full Path of Exile 2 patch 0.3.0b patch notes below, with the patch expected to arrive by the end of the week. In a recent interview, Path of Exile 2 director Jonathan Rogers confirmed the ARPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-leave-early-access-in-2025-dont-believe-thats-possible-anymore/1100-6534129/" data-ref-id="1100-6534129">won't be leaving early access in 2025</a>. He said "things have taken a bit longer than we'd hoped" but that he believed it wouldn't be "too much longer" before Grinding Gear Games is finished with the game's remaining two story acts. Rogers said The Third Edict update is Grinding Gear Games' attempt at "solving every problem people are currently unhappy about."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Path Of Exile 2 The Third Edict Update 0.3.0b Patch Notes</h2><h3>Rise of the Abyssal Changes</h3><ul><li>Abyssal Monsters can now be bound as Spectres.</li><li>The Vessel of Kulemak's Teleport Slam can no longer be avoided, and the damage it deals has been reduced.</li><li>Improved the telegraphing for the Vessel of Kulemak's arena-wide cleave.

<p>Did you know that Yuzo Koshiro, legendary video game composer, has made a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis shmup? It was released on Steam back in July, with our friends over at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steamdeck/earthion">Time Extension giving it a glowing review</a>. It was due to launch on consoles, including Switch, at the same time, but <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/the-console-versions-of-yuzo-koshiros-earthion-have-been-delayed">was pushed back to "mid-September"</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> will be landing that mid-September date, as the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/earthion-switch/">eShop page</a> says the game is coming out on 18th September 2025. That's just over two weeks away!</p>
<p>Published by Limited Run Games and developed by Koshiro's company Ancient, Earthion is a gorgeous-looking shoot 'em up developed <em>for</em> the classic Sega console. That version is coming in 2026, but for anyone wanting it on modern consoles, you won't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Like many of the best shmups, the Earthion keeps things simple, giving your ship a main weapon and two sub-weapons and eight diverse stages to blast your way through.</p>

<p>We'll point you towards Time Extension's review for the low-down, but if you're not sold on Makoto "Karu_gamo" Wada (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gotta_protectors_cart_of_darkness">Gotta Protectors: Cart Of Darkness</a>) and Koshiro's yet, here's a little snippet from that review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Earthion is everything I'd hoped it would be when Yuzo Koshiro first announced it; a challenging shmup which pushes Sega's 16-bit hardware to its limits in terms of visuals and audio whilst combining a high level of polish with tight gameplay and plenty of longevity."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well now, that sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Let's hope that the 18th September date sticks — we've had no word from the publisher or developer on it yet, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Earthion in the comments</em>.</p>

It’s never too late to get mad about the untimely fate of Human Head Studios’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. It helps that people keep leaking videos of the thing. The latest batch includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">an opening sequence</a>, a full mission playthrough from an open world, a flythrough of an undercity area, a prototype chase sequence, and scenes of combat. Watch the bulk of them below, and grieve. Alas for Killian Samuels, the beanie-wearing US marshal turned alien bounty-hunter. He looked so humdrum back in 2012, especially when compared to the original 2006 game’s Cherokee protagonist Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi. Still, he has a certain tragic charisma, in hindsight.

<p>
If you missed the original Prey, ‘twas an uneven, UFO-ransacking first-person shooter with fancy level-splicing portal technology that has now been almost totally eclipsed by comparable features in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Narbacular Drop 2</a>. A lot of people liked it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prey-2006-review">not including John Walker</a> (RPS in peace). Human Head started making a sequel shortly after the original’s release, but according to a few former studio members, they only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-prey-2-confirmed">began developing Prey 2 in earnest</a> after the rights had passed to ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda. 
</p>
<p>
Where the first game had been relatively linear, the second was to be an open world affair with a bounty-hunting theme. Bethesda announced it in 2011. But then something went wrong. Human Head quietly called time on the project near end of 2011, despite being “very close to an alpha state, with all major content pieces represented”, in the words of former project lead Chris Rhinehart. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ugh-prey-2-seems-to-have-been-cancelled">Rumours of Prey 2’s cancellation</a> swirled around over 2012, with Bethesda removing the game from their website. 
</p>

<p>
Then, in 2013, it was reported that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/human-dead-dishonored-dev-rumored-to-be-on-prey-2">the project had been reassigned to Dishonored developers Arkane</a>, scrapping all previous work by Human Head in the process. Bethesda officially cancelled Prey 2 in 2014. In 2016, they announced that Arkane would develop a series reboot.
</p><p>
Released in 2017, Arkane’s Prey is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">a dashedly fine game</a>, one of the swooniest and spaciest of immersive sims, but it's hard not to mourn for Human Head. The full story of Prey 2's cancellation has yet to be told, but according to reports at the time, Bethesda pushed tough deadlines and feature requests on an increasingly cash-strapped Human Head while simultaneously looking to acquire them. Human Head eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumor-prey-2-development-stricken-by-dev-strike">downed tools in protest</a>, and the two companies were unable to haggle it out before Human Head’s contract with Bethesda ran out in 2012. 
</p>
<p>
Accounts of events differ between the companies, as you’d expect. Bethesda have resisted the idea that they were conniving to acquire Human Head, arguing that the project simply didn’t meet their standards. Having watched these videos, I'm inclined to say that Human Head should have been allowed to go the distance.

<p>
The leaked videos show off a little of the game’s planned open world bounty action. The game would have let you travel around a teeming alien city that reminds me of Coruscant and G-Police. You’d have been able to boost-glide and ledge-grab to surprise opponents. 
</p><p>
The video reveals a bustling population of aliens, all of whom sound like they have acute laryngitis, and some nightclubs featuring holographic erotic dancers, because no self-respecting blade runner’s local can do without a holodancer or two. You’d have been able to profile NPCs with a scanner, take them down with electric boladeros, and enlist the odd Klatoonian as a meatshield.

<p>
I’m more sold on the setting than the mechanics – there are passing hovercars, cargo trains, and distant flying billboards with a whole other FPS playing on them – but it looks, out of context, like a project that had legs. We will never know whether the studio could have seen it through: Human Head eventually closed doors in 2019. Beanieman RIP.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong release times</strong></h2><h3><strong>September 4</strong></h3><ul><li>7 AM PT</li><li>10 AM ET</li><li>4 PM CEST</li><li>11 PM JST</li></ul><p>As announced previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Silksong will cost $20</a> at launch on all platforms. There will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for original Switch owners.</p><h2><strong>What is Hollow Knight: Silksong?</strong></h2><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's 2017 game Hollow Knight. The game sold more than 15 million copies and was highly regarded critically. The sequel, Silksong, was originally going to be DLC for Hollow Knight, but Team Cherry said its scope grew to the point that it had become a full, standalone game. Silksong has players becoming the character Hornet in a 2D platforming world. The game has new enemy types and bosses, and the <a href="https://www.altchar.com/game-news/team-cherry-post-hollow-knight-silksong-dev-update-e3-demo-axgGa3o4jK8P" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Greymoor area is among the biggest Team Cherry has ever created.</a></p><h2><strong>Why did Hollow Knight: Silksong take so long to come out?</strong></h2><p>Team Cherry founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said Silksong was not stuck in development hell or anything like that. The enormous success of the 2017 game allowed the Australia-based developers to develop the follow-up at their own pace.</p><p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><p>One of the reasons why Silksong did not come out sooner was due to how, as previously stated, it was originally envisioned as an expansion to Hollow Knight. As for why Team Cherry went quiet and didn't discuss development updates with fans over the years, Gibson said the team opted not to because, "All we could really say is, 'We're still working on it.'"</p><p>Pellen added: "Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game."</p><p>At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially scheduled to launch before June 2023</a>, and Pellen said the team did "genuinely believe" the game would make it out then. But that didn't happen, of course.</p><p>The wait could have been even longer. Gibson said Team Cherry has a development structure that allows its members to "see results fasts," with ideas turning into real elements of the game "almost immediately." That was a fun way to work, Gibson said, but it also presented challenges.</p><p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," Gibson said. "Because I went, 'Everything I'm drawing here has to end up in the game. That's a cool idea, that's in. That's a cool idea, tha'ts in.' You realize, 'If I don't stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p><h2><strong>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong on Game Pass?</strong></h2><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">will be available at launch for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers</a>. Alternatively, as mentioned, it can be purchased outright for $20.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Rami Ismail is known recently for his work advising and consulting with game developers around the world, but he's also an accomplished developer in his own right, with games like Ridiculous Fishing, Luftrausers, and Nuclear Throne on his résumé. To that end, today he revealed his latest project, Australia Did It, and announced it's coming to PC later this year. You can check out the reveal trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHNfqtkQRm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHNfqtkQRm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Australia Did It (which is co-developed by Aesthetician Labs) claims to invent a new genre called tactical reverse bullet hell. It's a big swing to attempt to define a new style of game before yours even comes out, but Ismail's press release makes even stronger claims than that.</p><p>"I believe the games industry has been failing at supporting developer innovation and experimentation," reads a direct quote from Ismail in the press release. "Publishers, investors, and shareholders fund the same few safe bets, later and later in development - forcing even the most creative developers to make safe games with predictable ideas, and force in the latest flavour-of-the-day."</p><p>Ismail goes on to say that the way to break out of this cycle is to support games with truly new ideas, and that Mystic Forge, the publisher of Australia Did It, is doing exactly that by funding the project.</p>

<p>Australia Did It is a game about transporting cargo by train across a monster-infested, dried-out Atlantic Ocean. In the first part of an encounter, you'll place units along a grid defending your train as it prepares for the journey, using strategic grid-based combat to hold off monsters long enough for the journey to begin. Once your engine departs, it becomes a bullet hell machine, blasting out overwhelming amounts of ammunition the bullet hell genre typically has players try to avoid.</p><p>I don't personally see the genre title sticking – it's too many words, for one – but the game looks good so far, and I'm interested in trying it for myself soon. Australia Did It launches on PC later this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/03/rami-ismails-new-game-australia-did-it-is-a-tactical-reverse-bullet-hell]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's getting Hutt in here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are just one day away from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> on Switch 2, and while we at Nintendo Life are still hard at work in the Jedi Temple, getting our review in order, we do have some gameplay footage for you to feast your eyes on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In the above video, you'll find 16 minutes of Outlaws on Switch 2. We've got gameplay from a whole bunch of scenarios, including internal environments, stealth sections, open-world exploring and outer space dogfights, so you can get an idea of what Nintendo's latest hybrid has in store.</p>
<p>The good news is, it looks really rather solid. We felt a disturbance in the Force when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">initial impressions</a> on the game's performance began to appear out of PAX West, but from what we've seen with our own eyes far, it plays far better than expected — heck, it looks like a totally different game to the low-frame footage Ubisoft shared in official trailers. Sure, it's a step down from the PS5 version as far as visuals are concerned, but it's nothing like as choppy as we were braced for.</p>
<p>Everything that you'll see above is from docked play, but video producer extraordinaire Alex Olney has also had a chance to play about in handheld mode, and it sounds equally promising. "It's soft, but it's perfectly playable," he said. "Frame rate is stable enough, leagues ahead of what the official trailer showed, which is a blessed relief".</p>
<p>As we mentioned, you'll have to wait a little while longer before you can read our full review for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2, but we'll endeavour to have it with you as soon as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive's <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/">highly anticipated</a> 007 First Light is due to have another deep dive later today during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/">State of Play</a> event focused entirely on gameplay in the Hitman studio's take on James Bond, and a few details about the game have leaked ahead of the showcase, though nothing to do with how the game will play.</p>



<p>From prominent and reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580">Billbil-kun</a>, the price for the standard edition of 007 First Light appeared on an Amazon listing, which pins the game at $70 USD for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 editions. That marks it as another game where players don't have to worry about spending $80 to play it, but if you wanted more than just the game, IO Interactive is more than happy to oblige with a collector's edition, with a price set at a whopping $300.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 EXCLUSIVE - 2026 🚨</p><p>007 First Light from IO Interactive will be released in Physical format + Collectors Edition</p><p>And you can even pre-order them from now!</p><p>🔸 Standard Edition (PS5, Xbox Series, Switch 2): 69.99 US$</p><p>🔹 Collectors: 299.99 US$<br>- PS5: <a href="https://t.co/65g723UT7x">https://t.co/65g723UT7x</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>We don't yet know what that $300 price tag gets you besides a copy of the game, though if it's anything like other collector's editions, the remaining $230 likely covers the cost of a statue or figure representative of the game's charming protagonist and a few other bits and bobs for the biggest James Bond enthusiasts to enjoy.</p>



<p>What's perhaps more intriguing for those looking forward to 007 First Light, is that if price information has leaked hours ahead of today's gameplay deep dive, then that means we are likely hours away from learning the game's official release date. We already know the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/">game is due out in 2026</a>, but IO Interactive has refrained from saying when in 2026 we'll be able to order our 'shaken, not stirred' vodka martini's. Hopefully, we'll find out today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're swinging from the rooftops with excitement for the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>&nbsp;Universes Beyond <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">Spider-man</a> </em>set, and we're thrilled to have the official spoilers for two brand Bonus Sheet cards - straight from our friends at Wizards of the Coast! Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>MTG Spider-Man - Rest In Peace</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rest-in-peace-exclusive.jpg?itok=RPahGfVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rest-in-peace-exclusive.jpg?itok=lFGX-rEV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Graveyard hate has never looked this good! Featuring original artwork from this pivotal moment in the comics by Mark Buckingham and D'Isreali (from Spectacular Spider-Man #27 (2003)), I can't think of a single better moment to illustrate this card.</p>

<p>And with this full-art treatment, the art truly gets to shine as we see Peter Parker at his beloved Uncle Ben's grave. Your opponents running a mono-black sacrifice deck will&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;hold their head in their hands when you drop this on the battlefield.</p>

Once again, the full-art of these bonus sheet treatments really adds a lot of energy and chaos to this card.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of copying creatures, and I've always loved the way Rite of Replication doesn't restrict&nbsp;you to copying a creature you control. Does your opponent have an annoying Commander? Give them a taste of their own medicine!&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few hours into playing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>,</em> while I was creeping around a desolate and nightmarish world filled with dilapidated buildings and creepy, fleshy monsters, I heard a cat meow from behind a locked door. Later, after killing some nasty horrors and solving a puzzle, I returned with bolt cutters and freed the cat. In exchange, it granted me a useful item. All future cats I found in <em>Cronos</em> did the same. It was good to have an army of cats as allies in this strange, hellish world. Also good: <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, the latest horror game from Bloober Team.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake from Bloober Team</a> proved that the studio, which has sometimes been criticized for making sloppy, bad horror games, could knock it out of the park if given the chance. But remaking one of the greatest scary games of all time into something that’s also scary and good, while impressive, arguably isn’t as hard as creating something unique and fresh that is also memorable and creepy in its own right.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-horror-new-bloober-cronos-new-dawn-xbox-1851675319">So I was both excited and nervous about <em>Cronos</em></a>. Could Bloober deliver a worthy follow-up to the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake that was also a game wholly of its own creation? Well, the answer is mostly yes. While <em>Cronos</em> isn’t as good as <em>Silent Hill 2</em> (but like, what is?), it is still a fantastically nasty third-person horror game that is a perfect post-apocalyptic, sci-fi survival experience that fans of<em> Resident Evil 4 </em>will feel right at home with.</p>

  <p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is a third-person horror game that places you in the big, lumbering boots of The Traveler. This strange character is a time traveler of sorts with advanced weaponry and tech. Her mission, or “vocation,” is seemingly to fight back against a dangerous, unnatural virus that turns people into sickly, decaying monsters that only want to kill you and merge their flesh together with other monsters and corpses. Doing so lets them grow stronger, and you’ll want to burn bodies to stop that from happening. At some point in the ’80s, as seen during sections of the game in which you go back in time briefly, this horrible virus spread across the planet and destroyed everything. Now you and your fellow Travelers work tirelessly to stop it, contain it, and learn more about it. Or maybe, you all are to blame…</p> <p>The narrative <em>Cronos</em> weaves is weird and kept me guessing for most of my time playing it. Sadly, I wasn’t able to finish the game and had to restart it due to some technical issues involving the game’s PS5 build (don’t worry, this won’t happen to you), but from what I was able to play (and later re-play), <em>Cronos</em> tells an odd story that isn’t like that in any horror game I’ve played in recent memory. It doesn’t always work and it can sometimes feel like you go long stretches without the narrative moving forward, but I mostly enjoyed peeling back another bloody layer of flesh from this disgusting onion.</p>

 <p>The real meat of <em>Cronos</em> is found outside of the cutscenes and dialogue. Most of the game is spent creeping around horrible places with limited ammo, health items, and other resources, trying desperately not to die to some nasty flesh-ghoul in the dark. Combat in <em>Cronos</em> is tough at times, especially if you let any of the monsters merge with dead monsters or other corpses. Bigger enemies easily made me burn through most of my ammo and sometimes proved tougher than the actual boss fights. Thankfully, you can use the environment to your advantage; there are many oil tanks and red barrels dotted around the wasteland, which can be very useful for thinning out the herds of enemies the game sometimes throws at you.</p> <p>I do expect some will be put off by how much combat is in <em>Cronos</em> and how hard it can be, especially if you aren’t hoarding resources like a crazed survivalist who has spent too many weeks listening to Joe Rogan podcasts. I liked the tough-as-nails encounters, especially as I started to upgrade my suit and guns and could put up a better fight, but your mileage may vary.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622721"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622721">©Bloober Team</figcaption></figure> <p>Between these fights and scrapping for supplies, you occasionally solve environmental puzzles by using a strange energy tether tool that can let you manipulate time by either rewinding or fast-forwarding specific areas of the map through the timeline. So a set of collapsed stairs can be rewound to when they were whole again, or a fallen piece of flooring can be brought back to its original location and raised like an elevator in the process. It’s a neat trick that looks cool, but it sometimes felt like the designers forgot it was a part of <em>Cronos</em>, and I’d go a long time between these time shenanigans. Still, I enjoyed messing with the flow of time, and being able to rewind it to bring back a red barrel and use it again against flesh monsters was fun.</p> <p>What I didn’t enjoy were the technical issues I encountered playing <em>Cronos</em>. While things greatly improved after Bloober Team sent me a new build of the game running on PS5, I still encountered performance spikes, weird animation bugs, broken subtitles, and some classic Bloober Team jank. The quality of character dialogue also varies wildly. Sometimes folks you encounter sound like real people, with great performances supporting excellent writing, and other times you might think you’re watching a cheesy <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> horror movie, just without the bots and Joel riffing over the top of the bad acting and clunky dialogue. Thankfully, the game is mostly the Traveler talking to herself and the cats she finds while recording and documenting everything.</p> <p>I’m excited to return to <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> and finish it, as the large chunk of the game I played, while at times rough, was an earnest and dedicated attempt by Bloober to create something new and creepy. Not every part of <em>Cronos</em> succeeds at what Bloober set out to do, but most of it does, and often in a way that sets it apart from other recent horror games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-bloober-team-underdog-proved-wrong-remake-1851787141">This might not be as good as the<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remake</a>, but those craving a new third-person survival horror game that is more shooty-shooty, like <em>RE4</em> or <em>Dead Space,</em> will want to check out <em>Cronos</em> when it launches on September 5 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2 and PC.</p>

              <p>Nothing grabs consumer eyeballs like a bundle deal. But who could possibly avert their eyes when Amazon takes an elite-level touchscreen laptop like<strong> the Dell Inspiron 15 3535 and bundles it with Windows 11 Pro and a box of goodies including a stylus pen, camera privacy cover, and USB flash drive</strong>, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">and offers that $3,000 package for just $800?</a></p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 alone at that price is a steal, especially when you see how loaded this model is.<strong> It’s packed with 32GB of RAM and a fat 1TB solid-state drive, with the AMD Ryzen 7 processor at the heart of the machine to make everything run fast and smoothly</strong>. The bundle add-ons of usually sold-separately necessities like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">pre-installed Windows 11 Pro</a> with Copilot, a protective sleeve, and 128GB USB flash drive are the clincher that make this deal truly amazing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Shortcuts Taken</h2>
<p>We know, bundle deals are often just the sweetener to sell an iffy product that doesn’t move units on its own. This is most definitely not that. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 is a total beast, with a 15.6-inch touchscreen that’s also LED-backlit and full-HD (1920×1080 resolution) with a refresh rate of 60Hz. The screen takes up nearly all of the inside lid thanks to the slender borders. The AMD Ryzen 7 processor can really cook, with speeds of up to 4.5GHz at the ready.</p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 isn’t one of those thick, heavy old-school laptops that are a chiropractor’s nightmare when carried in a shoulder bag. It’s sleek and trim at just three-quarters of an inch thick with the lid closed, and the 3.6 pound weight isn’t going to drag you down. The anti-glare screen, HD webcam, and generous array of ports and connection options complete the package.</p>



<h2>Meet Your Copilot</h2>
<p>This bundle deal also does not skimp on the operating system, as Windows 11 Pro is preloaded and just a press of the power button away from launch. Pro is designed for business professionals and power users, packed with advanced security network management features. It also comes with Copilot, one of the very best of the huge recent wave of AI assistants. Copilot is a great source for quick, accurate research, and if you’re ever stuck on writing the perfect email or any other creative effort, Copilot is one of the best assistants around.</p>
<p>This incredible bundle is topped off with an accessories kit that includes a stylus pen (remember, the Inspiron is a touchscreen), privacy cover for the webcam, 128GB USB flash drive, laptop dust plug, protective sleeve, and microfiber cleaning cloth. These are all of the little incidentals that can run up a shockingly big bill as add-ons, and they’re free. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">Amazon’s $800 deal on this massively packed bundle is a killer 73%-off deal that brings you an elite-level laptop, OS, and accessory package at a savings of $2,200.</a></p>

            <p>Shift Up has announced in a recent financial report that it intends to expand the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> franchise with "various derivative works".</p>
<p>The financial report (<a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20250814004388">which can be read here though is entirely in Korean</a>) dives into the success of its different products including Stellar Blade in the section titled "Main Products and Services". There, the company highlights the game's stellar (zing) performance both at launch and with its port to PC.</p>
<p>The report states (via machine translation): "Through this, [Stellar Blade] was able to effectively secure a new user base and further strengthen its position as a global AAA franchise IP. We plan to develop various derivative works to expand the  [Stellar Blade] IP so that  [Stellar Blade] can establish itself as a well-made IP."</p>

<p>This should not be a massive surprise for two major reasons. The first being that Stellar Blade has proven exceptionally successful for Shift Up, especially when you consider it was an original work for the studio. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days">The game sold over a million copies on PC within three days of the Steam version going live</a>, after all.</p><p>Secondly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">Shift Up previously stated its intention to make a Stellar Blade 2 back in May</a>, courtesy of an investor presentation. So true Stellar Blade fanatics have further evidence of something to look forward to. If you want a tinfoil hat angle to this bit of news, it's interesting to note this most recent financial report makes note of a general intent to make "derivative works", rather than solely stating a sequel. Though, that's pure speculation.</p>
