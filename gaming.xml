            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="HautePad X 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd8949de626ff/hautepad-x-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cosmox Gaming is best known for its Haute Pad range of arcade controllers, many of which can be considered budget options for fight fans, while pretty much all of them are immediately compatible with the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The HautePad X wired controller is a slightly different proposition, and it’s a <em>wild</em> one. It’s comfortably the most premium of Cosmox Gaming’s controllers at a base price of <strong>$229.99</strong>, and there's a good reason for that. Unlike most arcade controllers which just have one main function, the X boasts several thanks to its modular design.</p>
<p>If you opt for every available module (which ramps up the price even more; the low-profile suite alone costs $69.99), you can completely customise the X to your liking, swapping out the full-profile ‘Ice Cream’ switches for low-profile ‘Wind Engine’ switches, inserting a pair of analogue sticks, or even completely ditching the leverless approach for a more traditional joystick. It’s a remarkable design, and I could definitely see other manufacturers attempt something similar in the future.</p>

<p>The X comes with its own carrying case, and it's worth highlighting this right off the bat. It looks like an average laptop bag from the outside, but opening it up reveals two main compartments. The top houses the controller itself, while the bottom contains compartments for any additional modules and tools you might want to keep handy. There’s no dedicated slot for the joystick module, which launched later, so you’ll need to figure out how best to transport this if you’re taking the controller out and about.</p>
<p>Closing the case also reveals an indentation around the edge that displays the Cosmox Gaming logo, and this is perfectly placed to act as a makeshift ‘cushion’ of sorts if you happen to play on your lap. This gives the controller more height and may prove more comfortable for some players, while the indentation prevents it from moving during more intense gaming sessions.</p>
<p>The controller itself is exceptionally well-made, with the majority of the body constructed from aluminium with RGB lighting around the entire edge. It weighs in at 1.32kg (or 2.92lbs) with an elegant, minimalist design with two subtle logos in each lower corner. Across the bottom, meanwhile, is a full non-slip cover to keep it nice and secure when playing on a desk. Even if you don't get any additional modules, this is a superb leverless arcade controller on its own.</p>

<p>Despite the brushed finish of the aluminium, I did notice that it still picks up the odd fingerprint here and there. They mostly fade away, but heavy usage over time may result in some unsightly marks. Keep it clean with a microfibre cloth, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>A function bar at the top contrasts the main body with a glossy finish, and contains the home button, +, –, back, and turbo (in Switch mode, '–' actually functions as the 'Capture' button). On the left, you’ll find a tournament lock toggle, while a small OLED screen is situated in the middle. This displays your button presses in real-time while also providing information on which profile you’re using along with any <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=SOCD">SOCD</a> cleaning modes.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you’ll need to make sure to set the controller to the correct profile to use it with Switch or Switch 2. This is easy: looking at the module on the top right, these contain your action buttons, and all you need to do is hold in the bottom left button (labelled ‘A’) while plugging the device into the Switch. Done!</p>

<p>The controller will remember your profile, too, so you won’t need to faff about with this whenever you want to play; just plug it in and off you go. Those on PS5 and Xbox will need to purchase a separate authenticator to plug into the top right USB slot, but Switch owners needn't worry about this at all. Happy days.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the HautePad X comes with built-in LED lights to label the buttons; similar to those found on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Controller</a>. This isn't dynamic, though, so when you set the device to Switch mode, the button functions won’t match up with the labels. So ‘A’ becomes ‘B’, ‘X’ becomes ‘Y’, and so on. Once you’ve played a few games, you’ll soon become accustomed to the layout and you won’t even need to consult the labels, but it’s something to watch out for if you’re just getting started.</p>
<p>Now onto the modules. Starting with the left directional buttons, you can customise this with high-profile switches, low-profile switches, WASD keyboard switches, or a joystick. Excluding the joystick for a moment, the other three modules can also be angled up to 30° by loosening the two screws and turning the module while it’s in place. It’s worth just placing your fingers over the buttons and seeing what feels most comfortable, then simply angle the module accordingly.</p>

<p>The screws are crucial to swapping out the modules, and the HautePad X comes with the correct screwdriver to remove and install each piece. With the Switch 2 showing just how convenient magnets can be, there’s a small part of me that wishes the X utilised this technology for convenience. On the flip side, waggling the joystick module about would make me quite nervous about yanking it out entirely, so having the screws in place to keep everything secure feels like the right move.</p>
<p>With the bottom module, you can customise this with analogue sticks and an optional blank module if you happen to be using the joystick, plus the usual high/low profile switches. The analogue sticks are the one part of the entire controller that caused me quite a lot of hassle, and it’s because they’re simply not plug and play.</p>
<p>Using them correctly requires a fair bit of remapping via the configuration tool (which is accessed by plugging the device into a PC), merely thanks to the nature of using sticks vs. standard buttons. Even when you’ve got everything working, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> isn’t ideal or comfortable. I suspect that something like JunkFood Arcade’s new <a href="https://junkfoodarcades.com/products/sworl-multiconsole">SWORL controller</a> might be better suited for these types of games, since it’s built with this configuration right out of the box.</p>

<p>The right module comes with just two options: high-profile and low-profile switches – easy, so let’s move on to the joystick module. This thing is awesome and, unlike the analogue sticks, works straight away. This is because there are four Ice Cream switches housed in the base, so the movement of the stick hits these switches accordingly, thus creating the correct input.</p>
<p>It also comes with three optional input gates, so if you’re not keen on the curved square gate, you can swap this out for circular or octagonal options. Similarly, the module even comes with two additional springs for the joystick, so you can customise the tension. I found the default was pretty much spot on. Finally, the joystick topper screws off, so if you want to purchase something a bit flashier than the basic black model, then that’s an option. All in all, as accurate as leverless controllers are, there’s just something inherently <em>fun</em> about a more traditional joystick, and it works wonderfully.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you could get this controller as it is, no modules, and have a grand ol' time with it. The default high-profile switches are great and are perfect for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a>, but I personally stick to the low-profile suite as my go-to. There's slightly less travel required for each button press, and I'd say they're slightly quieter too. Whichever option you go for, the spacing of the switches is slightly closer together compared to 8BitDo's offering, so this is especially beneficial for those with smaller hands; you're not going to be stretching all over the place to pull off those sick combos.</p>
<p>As for the WASD module, this is a particularly great option for 2D platformers. Things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra Anniversary Collection</a> or even the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> on NSO feel really satisfying, and unlike a lot of d-pads these days which can sometimes register incorrect inputs, having each direction on a separate key naturally renders this particular issue null and void.</p>
<figure><a title="HautePad X 19" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/266477684c981/hautepad-x-19.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The HautePad X is a marvel of modular design. The fact that most of the modules can simply be slotted into place without having to faff around with wires is mad, and whether you're into low-profile, high-profile, or WASD switches, or you prefer a more traditional joystick, most options here are simply excellent.</p>
<p>The downside is that the (optional) analogue stick module is a bit of a hassle to set up, and even when you're good to go, it can't replace the comfort of a standard controller. With this in mind, while the HautePad X is striving to be more than just a fight pad, its overall appeal may still be limited to the fighting game community. If you fit into that group, then what you've got here is one of the best options available for Switch and Switch 2 right now – just so long as you can stomach the premium price point.</p>

            <p>Whenever possible, I like to sucker-punch everybody's weekend plans by blogging the release of a huge 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, factory sim or other managerial timesink last thing on Friday. In this case, I'm ambushing you with the avid rodent carpentry of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</a>, the new city builder from Railgrade developers Minakata Dynamics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse. It's got 40 different commodities, an elaborate weather simulation, and a demo out now on Steam. Haha, yes! You are welcome.
</p>
<p>In Whiskerwood, you are a mouse mayor setting up island colonies on behalf of some bastard fat cats. Yes, this one's a straight-shooting allegory, but going by the release date trailer, any transferable learnings about the plight of the mouse proletariat come a distinct second to the joy of plaiting conveyor belts.

<p>"Though your ship arrives with an initial supply of resources and a starting band of mice, you must quickly establish core structures, essential services, and production capabilities to ensure continued growth and prosperity," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">the Steam page</a>. "Establish waste management and healthcare facilities, ensure buildings are properly heated and maintained, and send forth your mice to fell trees, mine mountains, and tend to the fields and fish. 
</p><p>"The cats will demand their due," it goes on, "and your own citizens will abandon the colony if their needs aren't met on a daily basis - you must strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat." Cue opening bars of the Circle of Life.
</p>
<p>Other bulletpoints stress the role of verticality. Given that you're building on fairly titchy islands, you'll soon need to layer them up by either plunging underground or stretching your production facilities up mountainsides. It doesn't seem quite as extreme as All Wall Fall, in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-diseased-mind-makes-a-city-builder-with-actual-building-physics">your teetering metropoli are subject to actual real-time physics</a>, but those mice factories do look rather cramped and precarious.
</p>
<p>Your mice colonists have distinct attributes that fit certain tasks, together with preferences and weaknesses. Some are cool with labouring underground, others are all fine and dandy with air pollution. Up to a point, anyway. In good news for the bleeding hearts who feel bad about forcing virtual animals to breath smog for 100 hours, the Steam page suggests that you can one day overthrow the cats. 
</p>
<p>"Come rain or shine, the shipments must be fulfilled to feline satisfaction lest they call upon their henchmen to violently remind you of your duties," it thunders. "Will you forever serve this oppressive paw? Or will you raise your whiskers in defiance?"
</p><p>The game simulates a whole kaboodle of things. Different growing conditions per crop, for instance: you'll want damp caves for mushrooms, good soil and sunlight for wheat, and high ground for potatoes. (I grow potatoes. I wasn't aware they were best planted on hilltops.) If starting terrain conditions are suboptimal, you can lay hot water pipes to create greenhouse environments. All this and: naval combat! You'll be able to send forth galleons of nautical nibblers to scout new islands and hopefully not get the shit kicked out of them by pirates.</p>
<p>One comparison is the beaver-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timberborn">Timberborn</a>, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">best building games</a>, but I'm also slightly reminded of fellow Hooded Horse production <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>, sans roguelike elements. Whiskerwood launches into early access on 6th November, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126370/Whiskerwood_Demo/">find that demo on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, I’m seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that there’s some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. </span><i><span>Crossworlds&nbsp; </span></i><span>doesn’t really have a story like previous </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, they’re gonna try to rustle their opponents’ feathers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, they’re usually pretty chill, and it’s sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they haven’t really had much screentime together over the years. So sit back and enjoy some of the best exchanges I’ve seen online thus far.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMEGA REALLY SAID YOU HAVE  NO MONEY, NO LEADS NO BITCHES</p> <p>OH MY GOD😭😭😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF">https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF</a></p> <p>— Chonzo (COMMS OPEN) (@chonzodraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/chonzodraws/status/1968712490281287904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get the feeling Shadow might not like Charmy.</p> <p>Though to be fair he doesn't seem to like a lot of people. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZhyKA60fqu">pic.twitter.com/ZhyKA60fqu</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968672404940451959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don't think you can blame Shadow for this TBH they've barely even interacted beyond that one recent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDWSonic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IDWSonic</a> issue. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/C1ubko6qvn">pic.twitter.com/C1ubko6qvn</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968745172587471248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn, Jet is really mad at Big <a href="https://t.co/8u3lIcKwzz">pic.twitter.com/8u3lIcKwzz</a></p> <p>— Funkin 🦉🐓 (@funkin03) <a href="https://twitter.com/funkin03/status/1968711269621383350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is why Shadow is the best Sonic character.

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sports FC 26 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-review-in-progress.1302774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the last few decades, soccer (or football, if you’re not from the US like me) hasn’t changed much. Sure, there are new rules, improved tactics, and so much more money involved in the modern game – but at its heart, it's still all about kicking a ball into a goal more than the other team. So how does a series like EA Sports FC improve each year when the sport it’s emulating isn’t introducing massive changes? For me, it’s about quality-of-life updates, and FC 26 has those in spades. You’ve heard the phrase “death by a thousand cuts,” but this is more like “fixed by a thousand pieces of tape.” It’s not that every problem has been solved, and many of the micro issues like confusing player-switching and weird tackle animations have returned from FC 25 – but at least in my early time with it, FC 26 is inching in the right direction in nearly every aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A phenomenal example of this is the new gameplay presets. In the past, everyone was using the same gameplay style, whether diving into competitive games in Ultimate Team or trying to win the league against CPU opponents in Manager Mode. This year, EA has split things between two different presets: Competitive and Authentic. With the Competitive preset, you can expect the fast-paced action and smarter AI teammates that you might be used to from previous FC/FIFA games. Meanwhile, Authentic will feel more realistic to what you see on the real-life pitch every weekend. Players are slower, and you need to use your tactical intelligence to get into scoring position. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important part of this change is that these two options do not impact each other. That means EA can tune Competitive mode however is needed without changing the balance of Authentic mode, something they couldn’t do in previous versions of FC. I’ve only played about a dozen games with each preset so far, but they already feel distinct in a way that is valuable. Players come to FC 26’s various modes for different reasons: Career Mode players want a game that plays as close to real-life a possible, while Ultimate Team and Clubs players want fair and balanced online competition. Those two ideals have sometimes worked against each other in the past, so giving us two totally separate gameplay styles lets EA serve both communities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s strange about the implementation is that the Authentic preset is restricted to offline modes only. That means you can’t even use it in your Squad Battles matches despite them being the only single-player content in Ultimate Team. It’s something I hope is added in the future, as it feels strange not to include all of the single-player content by default, especially when it does exactly that with the new version of the Season Pass.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This might be the worst version of a Season Pass in a sports game yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before diving into some of the other positive changes, let's go over that Season Pass, as it’s one of the biggest points of contention for me. Last year, EA introduced a paid Season Pass into FC 25 toward the end of the cycle, so we knew this was coming, but seeing it drop on day one does sting. You can ignore it and stick with the free version of the pass, or even earn enough in-game currency to buy it without spending real-world money, but I would argue that this might be the worst version of a Season Pass we’ve seen in a sports game yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue with FC 26’s Season Pass is that you’re not just earning rewards for Ultimate Team, where people are already (unfortunately) conditioned to spend money. You’re also earning a ton of rewards for Clubs, Player Career, and Manager Career. The latter is where things really get icky, because one of the big draws for FC 26 is that Icons and Heroes are finally available in Manager Mode. For the first time ever, you can take classic players like Luis Figo, Toni Kroos, and Julie Foudy and put them into your Manager Mode saves. It should be a revelation, but instead, EA made the strange decision to lock many of these players behind the Season Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FC 26 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several reasons this is frustrating. The first is that you probably won’t be able to acquire enough XP for them by playing Manager Mode alone. EA might implement more ways for non-Ultimate Team players to earn XP, but with how things are currently constructed, you’ll <em>need </em>to dive into that lootbox opening simulator if you want to finish enough of the pass to claim all of the Career Mode rewards. Even as someone who primarily plays Ultimate Team, this change sucks. I already know how bad FC’s monetization can get, and I hate seeing it expanded to more of the playerbase in a way that feels scummy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if that weren’t frustrating enough, Career Mode players aren’t likely to earn enough Ultimate Team-specific currency to purchase the Season Pass in that mode alone. That means you’ll need to spend real money to unlock players like Gianfranco Zola, Miroslav Klose, and Park Ji-Sung. Keep in mind, this is only the first Season Pass. If FC 26 continues to lock Icons and Heroes behind future passes, we’ll likely see desirable players like Ronaldinho, Ruud Gullit, and Johan Cruyff tucked behind a paywall as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unfortunate situation that reeks of EA trying to get even more money out of its playerbase than usual. It’s bad enough that Ultimate Team players are being milked dry, but now you can’t even enjoy your offline Career Mode without feeling the pull to spend money.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the modes feature fun updates to their tried and true formulas.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this even more painful is that most of the modes feature fun updates to their tried and true formulas this year. For example, the new Manager Live Hub lets you dive into specific challenges and earn new jerseys for your club. These feel like the next step toward a historical mode like the Negro Leagues option in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review"><u>MLB The Show</u></a>, as you’ll be challenged to recreate moments like Jamal Musiala’s double with Bayern Munich or take a mid-level club like SK Rapid or Strasbourg to European glory. The classic version of Career Mode is still there, but Manager Live gives you a rotating list of challenges that will test your skill on and off the pitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Ultimate Team is home to several small yet meaningful changes. Everything from the return of tournaments to the ability to choose the cosmetics on your Evolutions feels carefully crafted to deliver the improvements fans have been asking after for years. We’ll have to wait a month or two to see the impact of the slower Ultimate Team power curve, and I’m hesitant to judge the stability of the servers until they are live for everyone, but my early experience is positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m not much of a Clubs player, the new Archetypes have certainly piqued my interest. Without a dedicated group, it’s unlikely I will spend too much time in Clubs, but the Archteype system seems like an improved way to handle progression to my untrained eye. While a meta will surely settle over the mode in the coming weeks, having this clear sense of forward momentum makes me wish I had a group of 10 friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have more to play this weekend, but so far FC 26 seems to provide enough quality-of-life changes that I feel more positive about the on-pitch product after a few years of stagnation. However, I can’t help but be annoyed by how heavily monetized every mode is becoming. I’ve always felt it was relatively easy to ignore the pull to spend extra money unless you wanted to compete at the very top of Ultimate Team, but that’s much less true this year. Now, not even the Career Mode players are safe. FC 26 is EA at its most money-hungry yet, and I can’t help but worry where we’re going next.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a> has been upstaged this summer by a bitter fight between publisher Krafton and the former leadership team at the game's studio, Unknown Worlds. Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as CEO Ted Gill were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">forced out of the studio</a>, and they subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-devs-file-lawsuit-against-krafton/1100-6533107/" data-ref-id="1100-6533107">filed a lawsuit against Krafton</a> that contends the latter is attempting to avoid paying them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million performance bonus</a>. Now, Krafton has changed its legal argument about why the leadership team was dismissed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Krafton asserted that the founders intended to release Subnautica 2 in early access this year before the game was ready in order to secure their performance bonus. The founders' lawyers at Fortis Advisors asked for proof of this assertion during the trial's discovery phase, and Krafton didn't provide any. Krafton subsequently withdrew that part of its legal filing and no longer claims it as a reason for their dismissal. Fortis said this marks a "seismic shift in the case" and characterized it as "a little bit bewildering."</p><p>Krafton still maintains that the founders shirked their responsibilities to oversee Subnautica 2 to completion and accuses them of downloading files and keeping devices that had confidential info on them. Although that detail only came to light after the leadership team was removed, Krafton argues that it retroactively justifies their termination.</p><p>Fortis contends that Krafton hasn't been properly cooperating during discovery and is ignoring requests to confer or share information pertinent to the case. The most recent update is that both sides agreed to confer.</p><p>This case may play out in court for years, but the battle in the court of public opinion has already begun. After fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-fans-are-calling-for-a-subnautica-2-boycott/1100-6533092/" data-ref-id="1100-6533092">openly called for a boycott of Subnautica 2</a> over reports that the $250 million bonus was being withheld, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Krafton has extended the bonus period into next year to allow the Unknown Worlds team a better chance of meeting its financial benchmarks and earning $25 million to be split among 40 employees. The remaining $225 million of that bonus would have gone to the former leadership team prior to their forced exits from the company.</p><p>Subnautica 2 is expected to hit early access in 2026 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>If you're like me, one of the first things you do when booting up a game is checking out the options in the Settings menu. From audio to subtitles, brightness to performance, you're fine-tuning the particulars to ensure the game is playing just right for you. Maybe during this, you're also changing your controller settings from "normal" to "inverted," and if you've ever wondered why you do that, well, science may have an answer for you.</p><p>In a new scientific paper reported on by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scientists-have-worked-out-why-some-people-invert-video-game-controls-and-its-not-just-because-they-are-correct" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Dr. Jennifer Corbett and Dr. Jaap Munneke at Brunel University London have sought to study the neuroscience behind a player's choice of "normal" or "inverted" controls. Titled "Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments," the duo discovered that there are a variety of factors that go into your decision of opting for a particular controller setting in games, and it seems to primarily revolve around how your brain perceives objects in 3D spaces.</p>

<p>Initiated during lockdown and published this month, Corbett and Munneke concluded in the study that "personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved" in why you choose to invert your controls in-game or not.</p><p>"Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not," Corbett said. "Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback."</p><p>To understand the phenomenon, Corbett and Munneke asked participants in the study to complete a questionnaire to understand their background and partake in an experiment around spatial awareness.</p><p>"They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical 'Simon effect' where it's harder to respond when a target is on the opposite vs. the same side of the screen as the response button," Corbett said. "Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted."</p><p>According to Corbett, the assumptions for why people prefer inverted controls were wrong. Instead, the biggest determining factor was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and ​​overcome the Simon effect.</p><p>"The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert," Corbett said. "People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks. Though [non-inverters] tended to be faster, they didn't get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate."</p><p>Essentially, just because a flight simulator may have been your first experience with a game doesn't mean you're inherently an inverter. Similarly, just because you've always played with normal controller settings doesn't mean you're a non-inverter either. In fact, according to the study and Corbett's musings, switching your preferences could make you a better gamer.</p><p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try--and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” Corbett said. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn't mean they won't learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don't realise they're naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p><p>Next time you're contemplating your controller settings, whether you should go with your preference (either inverting or not inverting), you may want to reconsider the other option. It could help you last longer in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

<p>God 'a do it</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>After a lengthy Early Access period, we now finally know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> will be arriving as a Switch 1 &amp; 2 timed console exclusive on <strong>25th September</strong> — that's next week!</p>
<p>It's exciting times for those of us who have been waiting for the full launch all this time, and to make sure that nobody misses a beat, Supergiant Games has announced the exact times that the god-like roguelike sequel will arrive on the Switch eShop in each region.</p>
<p>The times were shared in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lz54umuubc2e">BlueSky</a>, and we've assembled the following list so you know the appropriate time to hop onto the eShop wherever you are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 9am PDT / 10am MDT / 11am CDT / 12pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 5pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 6pm CEST / 7pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 1am (Fri) JST / 12am (Fri) AWST / 2am (Fri) AEST</li></ul>


<p>As a reminder, Hades II will set you back <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> and there's even a free upgrade path to the 120fps Switch 2 edition if you opt for the S1 version at launch.</p>
<p>Those after the physical edition (which is complete-on-cart, we might add) will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on the game, with Supergiant announcing that boxes won't be hitting shelves until 20th November.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon-2000627131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon.1302735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all been there: that moment when your iPhone runs out of battery when you desperately need it to last. Even if you do have a power bank, more often than not, it’s the wrong cable, or worse, the standby battery isn’t even charged. That’s the frustration this 50,000mAh power bank seeks to eliminate entirely: It’s enormous in size, has all the cables you could possibly need integrated right in, and is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/">currently priced at an all-time low of $34 on Amazon, down dramatically from its usual $199</a>. That’s an <strong>83 percent off sale on a charger</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An Actual Power Bank That Fixes Everyday Charging</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the number that means the most: <strong>50,000mAh</strong>. That is just a phenomenal amount of mobile power. In all realism, you could <strong>charge your iPhone more than a dozen times before this battery depletes itself</strong>. That’s seven days of continuous use without having to use a wall charger, or more than enough power to charge your phone, your earbuds, your tablet, and even a friend’s phone when you and your group are all running low on power. The appeal is that you don’t need to bring a lot of extra accessories with you. Instead <strong>of working with adapters and wires, all you need is built-in</strong>. The unit contains four cables built in (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-A) so you just grab one out and plug in straight into your device.</p>



<p>And on top of that, this charger isn’t just small, but fast: With <strong>22.5W fast charging backed by PD 3.0 and QC 3.0/4.0 technology,</strong> it recognizes your device instantly and adjusts for optimal charging. For example, an iPhone 17 can go from zero to about 60 percent in half an hour. That’s faster than the old wall chargers Apple used to pack, and it’s incredibly useful when you’ve only got a few minutes before heading out the door.</p>
<p>Safety has been integrated into the system as well: The company also had a monitoring chip that keeps an eye on<strong> charging by milliseconds to avoid risks like overvoltage, overcurrent, or short circuits</strong>.

                <p>The Borderlands franchise is known for its recurring characters, and perhaps none stand out quite as much as Claptrap. This loud and eccentric little robot has long since stood as the series' mascot for good reason, with his endearing charm and infectious good mood. But there's no denying he can be a bit loud at times--and that certainly hasn't changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>. But what if you could change that?</p><p>Claptrap may not be as prevalent in this new entry as he has been in some other titles in the looter shooter franchise, but his presence is still consistent enough in Borderlands 4 to warrant a rather unique slider among all the other settings. For those who find this quirky guy more of a nuisance than a lovable goof, Gearbox has added a way to adjust his volume separately from all other volumes. Yeah, you can shut Claptrap up altogether if you want.</p><p>We can sense your excitement, so we'll tell you how to turn down Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4.</p><h2>How to turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4</h2><p>To turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4, pause the game and head to the "Options" menu. Scroll over one time to "Audio", then select "Advanced". On this menu, scroll to the very bottom to find a setting called "Claptrap?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631"></a><figcaption>You can adjust Claptrap's volume to make him more tolerable, or you can reduce it to zero to shut him up entirely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, you can adjust Claptrap's voice to make him quieter, or you can decrease the volume to zero so you'll never hear a peep from him again. You'll still be able to read his subtitles so that you know what he's saying when you pick up certain collectibles or engage in quests with him, so you're not really missing anything by turning him all the way down.</p><p>Whether you decide to mute Claptrap is entirely up to you, but don't ever tell him you've taken these measures. He may be slightly annoying sometimes, but the poor little guy doesn't deserve to have his feelings hurt.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4 </a>works wonders on Steam Deck, introducing significant image quality improvements in select games that make the performance hit more than worth it in most cases.</p>



<p>New comparison videos shared online by Deck Wizard compare <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> running on Steam Deck with AMD FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5. The side-by-side comparison of both games highlights how the new version of the upscaler, which has only recently unofficially become available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">Steam Deck</a>, delivers significantly cleaner and sharper image quality than its predecessor, making the performance hit well worth it in most cases. While both games are best experienced at 60 FPS - especially Stellar Blade, given its action-focused gameplay—the improvements already visible at this early stage suggest that FSR 4's implementation on the handheld platform has strong potential and may only get better with further optimization.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>AMD FSR 4 is the first version of the upscaler to go the full <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-fidelityfx-super-resolution-ai-follows-nvidia-dlss-intel-xess-better-visual-fidelity/">"AI" route</a>, following NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS in using machine learning to improve image quality and performance of modern games. Initially only available for RX 9000 series GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to use the new version of the upscaler on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RDNA 3</a> and RDNA 2 through a leaked INT8 version of FSR 4's source code, which can be manually implemented using tools like <a href="https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler">OptiScaler</a>. Although with a performance hit, the upscaler still delivers significantly better image quality on this old hardware.</p>



<p>More information on AMD FSR 4 can be found on its <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html">official website.</a></p>

              <p><span>In the wake of the assassination last week of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and other reactionary movements have wielded the act as a tool to silence critics of Kirk’s views, and those who are critical of the Trump administration more broadly. One of the most highly publicized instances of this was Disney-owned ABC’s pulling of </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i><span>, following pressure from the FCC, after the talk show ran a segment that said the Trump administration had latched onto the event in order to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHT7ICvMtlA"><span>“score political points.”</span></a><span> In response, several public figures have spoken out in protest, including some actors who have prominently worked for Disney by appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p> <p><span>Marisa Tomei, who plays Spider-Man’s Aunt May in the superhero franchise, took to Instagram to urge people to boycott Disney, including the Marvel movies she starred in, from </span><i><span>Captain America: Civil War </span></i><span>in 2016 to </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home </span></i><span>in 2021. May was killed in the last </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>movie by the Green Goblin, and given that her death was a thematic pillar of the film, it was unlikely that Tomei would have been asked to reprise the role, but still, speaking out against one of the most powerful companies in modern media isn’t nothing.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marisa Tomei reshares post urging for the boycott of Disney brands. <a href="https://t.co/7Ni0CSu3ui">pic.twitter.com/7Ni0CSu3ui</a></p> <p>— Buzzing Pop (@BuzzingPop) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzingPop/status/1968833688759591240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Meanwhile Tatiana Maslany, the actor behind the titular hero of </span><i><span>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</span></i><span>, posted on social media urging people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Maslany’s post was even more pointed, with her Instagram story featuring a photo of her in a motion capture suit while shooting the </span><i><span>She-Hulk </span></i><span>series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not everyone would risk their entire career for what’s right. Tatiana Maslany just did.

People who've never played it probably want a Bloodborne remake. It's safe to say that everyone wants a Bloodborne remake.

At one point, the duo fielded a question from someone seeking speculation about Sony's PC ports, particularly regarding Bloodborne.</p>

<p>"Has the PC porting kind of slowed down recently? Am I imagining that, or [has] there just [not] been too many games for them to port?" Minotti asked of Grubb.</p><p>Minotti noted that Bloodborne can't move because developer From Software must be involved with the project and the studio is busy--presumably with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-duskbloods/" data-ref-id="5000-671285">The Duskbloods</a>, and whatever else Hidetaka Miyazaki's scary mind is cooking up. Grubb agreed with this notion, adding that it seems like "[From doesn't] want to do it with Sony." He extrapolated on this point a bit more.</p><p>"Anything beyond From Software would have to be involved and they're not going to do it right now, I don't know," Grubb said. "But that's my understanding of the situation and it continues to be that way. I checked in on it relatively recently and kind of continue to hear, 'Nothing is happening with Bloodborne, so don't expect that.'"</p><p>In confusion, Grubb and Minotti couldn't make sense of why the 2020 remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demons-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-513796">Demon's Souls</a> and the 2022 racing sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gran-turismo-7/" data-ref-id="5000-513781">Gran Turismo 7</a> aren't already on PC. But the one that really tripped them up was a Bloodborne remake, which fans have been clamoring for.</p><p>Bloodborne doesn't need much of an introduction. However, if you can believe it, it's been 10 years since the acclaimed Lovecraftian action-RPG graced our PS4s. Unfortunately, it's been locked on that ancient hardware ever since, with nary a peep about it leaving that vault. Miyazaki has remained tight-lipped about a potential remake for the cult favorite, but he did say in February 2024 that the new hardware--namely, the PS5--could give a theoretical remake some "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theoretical-bloodborne-remake-could-receive-value-from-new-hardware-miyazaki-says/1100-6521268/" data-ref-id="1100-6521268">value</a>."</p><p>Although the value proposition Miyazaki proposed as a result of more powerful hardware sounds enticing, what this means in relation to Bloodborne is moot, considering there's been little movement on a port or remake for forever now. While a former PlayStation executive has theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">Miyazaki is likely too busy for a Bloodborne remake</a>--or a remaster or a 60fps update or some kind of morsel--Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-later-60fps-bloodborne-patch-gets-taken-down-by-sony/1100-6529174/" data-ref-id="1100-6529174">taken action against a fan-made patch</a> that added a higher frame rate to the legendary soulslike.</p><p>It truly does feel like Bloodborne is stuck in a grave, never to be resuscitated ever again. But as the saying goes, never say never. There's no official confirmation; however, you can never rule out the impossible. Maybe Miyazaki and friends are just waiting for the right time, or maybe Sony is looking for Miyazaki to pick the right team. Either way, though there's no movement right now, that doesn't mean there won't ever be movement. Patience is a virtue.</p><p>In other From Soft news, Nightrein just receieved <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/" data-ref-id="1100-6534351">a new Deep of Night mode</a> that makes the game even harder than it already was. Yeesh. Good luck out there, Nightfarer.</p>

			<p>Team Reptile, the studio behind the Jet Set Radio-inspired Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has just revealed its next game, Hyperfunk, which looks to be another fast-paced, music-infused, combo-focused rush. It'll be coming to PC and consoles when it's ready, but at the time of this writing, no release date or release window has been announced.</p>



<p>The news came from Team Reptile's <a href="https://team-reptile.com/hyperfunk-reveal/">website</a>, with a post that included a short description of the game and a teaser trailer, showing off a small snippet of gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Reptile's new game is called Hyperfunk</em>," the post reads. "<em>An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's clear from the trailer that Team Reptile is working to further refine what it did in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, focusing once again on fluid movement and trick-centric gameplay. It'll be interesting to see how else Hyperfunk evolves on the studio's previous work, and hopefully, we'll have a release date to look forward to soon.</p>



<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/">reviewed Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> when it launched back in 2023, we wrote "<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is a game that's clearly wearing its inspiration on its sleeve. With mechanics that are pretty easy to get into and a great soundtrack to boot, fans of Jet Set Radio and 3D platformer games in general should feel very pleased. While the game has some shortcomings that prevent it from being a masterpiece, it still delivers some memorable beats.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Zack here, filling in as your host today for your regularly scheduled Ethan edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. Let’s get through this thing together, and then at the end we can listen to some music and celebrate the upcoming weekend.</p> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> contains a big list of licensed songs and a lot of Limb Bizkit</strong></h2> <p>According to a new <em>Battlefield 6</em> leak, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1968725668042063960">as reported by <em>Battlefield Bulletin</em>,</a> the upcoming military shooter contains a surprisingly large list of licensed music. <em>BF Bulletin</em> says these songs will be played on the radio when driving in-game vehicles, but EA has yet to confirm any of this. Here’s the track listing, which contains three different songs credited to Limp Bizkit. Seriously.</p> <ul> <li>“Awake” – Godsmack</li> <li>“Bodies” – Drowning Pool</li> <li>“Break Stuff” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Can’t Stop” – Red Hot Chili Peppers</li> <li>“Domination” – Pantera</li> <li>“Got Each Other” – The Interrupters ft. Rancid</li> <li>“Hey Man, Nice Shot” – Filter</li> <li>“Invaders Must Die” – The Prodigy</li> <li>“Making Love to Morgan Wallen” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Master of War” – Bob Dylan</li> <li>“Nuthin’ But A G Thang” – Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg</li> <li>“Pain” – Chalk</li> <li>“You’ll Never Guess Who Died” – The Kinison</li> <li>“Battlefield: The After-party” by Henry Jackman &amp; Limp Bizkit</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://youtu.be/iCEGrHGmb1o">one of the listed Limp Bizkit songs was uploaded to Limp Bizkit’s official YouTube channel last week</a>. And the artwork for the song includes the singer on a tank that has <em>BF6</em> graffiti on it and the song’s credits list EA Music.&nbsp; So, yeah, I think we can deduce that this list is probably accurate.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">When I traveled to Los Angeles earlier this year</a> to attend the game’s big multiplayer reveal, I was shocked that its big trailer featured the Limp Bizkit song “Break Stuff.” I assumed it was a fun joke or a one-off thing. But it seems like EA and the people making <em>Battlefield 6</em> have partnered up with Limp Bizkit in some capacity, and folks, I’m not sure how I feel about any of this.</p> <h2><strong>Intel is still going to make its own GPUs following the Nvidia deal</strong></h2> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that GPU maker and tech giant Nvidia was partnering up with Intel as part of a large, long-term plan. Nvidia is investing billions into Intel and the two will work together on new products. Wild stuff. And if you were wondering if this meant the end of Intel’s own GPUs, that doesn’t seem to be the case for now. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intel-says-arc-gpus-arent-going-anywhere-just-yet-despite-the-new-nvidia-collaboration/">As <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, Intel still has plans to keep making Intel Arc cards for the foreseeable future. We’ll see how long that lasts.</p>

 <h2><strong>It seems like you can just buy a Switch 2 on Amazon now</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve been wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch 2, well, it’s pretty easy to do now. As pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-for-sale-on-amazon-no-invite-required-132503609.html">Engadget</a></em>, Amazon is now selling the console in the United States without any waiting list or hoops to jump through. You just fork over $500 and wait a couple of days, and there you go. I’ve also seen multiple Switch 2 units at my local Target. So it seems like you’ll be able to snag a Switch 2 without much effort ahead of the holidays.</p> <h2><strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>‘s excellent soundtrack now available on Nintendo’s Music app</strong></h2> <p>I’m so mad at myself that I’ve not finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. And a big reason for that is because I miss listening to the 3D smasher-jumper, which has one of the best Nintendo soundtracks in years. Thankfully, the songs are now available on the Nintendo Music app. Now, I just need to find time to finish that game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and the big button that blows everything up</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Law enforcement is reportedly digging into the gaming history of Charlie Kirk’s killer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">The legal battle between Sony and Tencent over a knock-off <em>Horizon</em> game continues</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>Sure, why not?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-version-0-11-0-is-now-available-for-download-improves-emulation-of-unreal-engine-games.1302636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4</a> PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for select games.</p>



<p>The 0.11.0 version, which can now be downloaded from the emulator's official website, introduces several technical changes and improvements that, by themselves, don't mean much to any regular user for the most part. In reality, these mark a significant improvement for the emulator regarding Unreal Engine-powered games, as many now boot on the emulator, and some are even in a playable state, although it will take a while to see the most advanced games run well on the emulator due to how technically demanding the engine is to emulate with complex shader pipelines and more. You can learn more about these changes with the official <a href="https://shadps4.net/post/shadps4-v0110-relased/">update notes.</a></p>



<p>The ShadPS4 emulator is the most advanced PlayStation 4 emulator available, and the one that is making the fastest progress among those in development. In just a few weeks last year, FromSoftware's Bloodborne, one of the most popular PlayStation 4 exclusive games that have yet to be ported to any other system, went from <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">barely bootable</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">fully playable even on dated systems</a> with better visuals and performance, thanks to the hard work of modders such as fromsoftserve who released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">visual overhaul </a>that is on par with many official remasters released in the past. After focusing on improving Bloodborne's emulation as much as possible, the emulator's developers have moved onto other PlayStation 4 exclusives, which the emulator is running better and better with each new release.</p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grimlore-games-will-drop-the-first-major-content-update-for-titan-quest-ii-%E2%80%9Csoon%E2%80%9D.1302633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After an<a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/"> initial delay</a> that pushed the game out of the first half of 2025, Grimlore Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/">shadow-dropped</a> Titan Quest II in early access this summer and had a strong launch with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/">300K copies sold in less than three days</a>. Now that the game has been out for a few months, Grimlore Games is preparing to release the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/508466096994518144">first major content update</a> for Titan Quest II, which will be in players' hands "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>The update will be Chapter 2 of the game's story and take players further into the Northern Beaches. You'll have to work to uncover the truth of Nemesis' plans while she continues to hunt you, and you try to find ways to become more than just a mortal if you want to be capable of defeating a god.</p>



<p>The new World Quests in the game will see you aid a crew of travelers who find themselves shipwrecked, which also turns into your own quest to find buried treasure. The update will also include a new chapter boss, Skylla, new enemies to defeat, and further refinements and tweaks to the game.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's no specific release date for when Chapter 2 will be available, nor are there more specific details on what'll be included, but Grimlore Games does have a roadmap for its early access plans that players can view to know what's coming next.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we'll have more specifics soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyperfunk-team-reptile-bomb-rush-cyberfunk</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyperfunk-is-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-team-reptiles-next-game.1302630/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lethal League&nbsp;</em>developer Team Reptile has revealed its latest game&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, and if you're a fan of the studio's last effort, it looks like you're going to love this one as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is an "extreme trick and graffiti game" in which you must pull off stylish trick combos in order to build your boost and speed through the city.</p>

<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>takes place in a "bright future" in which society is built around an online space known as the Hyper and graffiti crews compete with one another regarding "how to interpret this new world".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=6b0rbfO3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=-MwxBttC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>studio Team Reptile.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em>, you'll likely recognize the visual style Team Reptile is going for with&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; this is very much a closely-related spiritual successor rather than a departure from existing styles.</p>

<p>Still, the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>shows a game that looks like it's built much more around speed, trick combos, and traversal than its predecessor was, so if you thought&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>could do with being more kinetic and speedy, you're in luck.</p>

<p>There's also an online component to&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; you can hang out with random players online in the Hyper, but if you prefer to keep things local to you and your friends, you can chill with them in the streets of the game's city as well.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, which shows off the game's very&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>-inspired visual aesthetic and gameplay style, right here. No "Fly Like a Butterfly", though, sadly.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date or even a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you like. Hopefully, this one doesn't get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-delayed-to-2023-for-polish" rel="nofollow">delayed like its predecessor did</a>, eh?</p>

            <p>A group of game industry folks including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a> studio Nerial, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a> creators Santa Ragione and Streets Of Rage 4 outfit Lizardcube have launched Palestinian Voices in Gaming, an international volunteer network to support current and emerging independent Palestinian developers.</p>
<p>First convened in May 2024, the network are currently looking to connect Palestinian game devs with volunteers and funding partners. They'll provide administrative help to any developer trying to get access to funding, and assistance managing resources and volunteer contributions, once secured. They aim to follow and boost each project from "production to announcement to publication", and are already working with a range of smaller independent games, many of which explore recollections of pain and loss through speculative fiction and fantasy.

</figure>
<p>As you might expect, the network is a response to Israel's on-going mass killing and dispossession of Palestinians in Gaza, which has now <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/israel-has-committed-genocide-in-the-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds-16sep25/">formally been defined as a genocide by a UN inquiry</a>, together with the long-term killing, oppression and mistreatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and inside Israel's own borders.
</p><p>
"The dehumanisation of Palestinians is tied to their rare visibility in the cultural sphere," the organisers note on <a href="https://palestinian-voices-in-games.com/">their website</a>. "This dehumanisation costs lives - as the world remains indifferent to the ongoing genocide in Gaza and to the surge of violent oppression across the West Bank and inside Israel.
</p>
<p>"We want to push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians, not simply through representation but also through professional and economic support, so that Palestinian game developers may tell their own stories and reach global audiences."
</p><figure>

<figcaption>Being 2 | <span>Image credit: <cite>Iasmin Omar Ata / Delta</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Among the Palestinian game developers PVG are working with is Iasmin Omar Ata, whose forthcoming sci-fi adventure novel Being 2 is set in a Palestinian space colony. "You would have to fix the space colony during a black out, which would lead to flashbacks/hallucinations allowing to see past memories of Palestine," reads a summary from the developer's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlIa9Fa1lxJT6jgPrdioMoSrZsT77oAF/view?usp=sharing">portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>Another partner developer, Yusra, is working on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riyafagame/">RiYafa</a> (pictured in this article's header), an underwater experience "that combines testimony and symbolism to tell the story of her family and community based in the West Bank", in the words of a press release.
</p><p>Yasmine Batniji's Pomegranates is also set in the future. "Travel to the year 2048 and play as a memory keeper in the reclaimed and rebuilt Gaza City," reads the summary. "You will be tasked with tracing echoes of the current war at the renovated Al-Ahli hospital." You can find a version of it on <a href="https://gabbahbaya.itch.io/pomegranates">Itch.io</a>.
</p>

<p>Lastly, there's Rasheed Abueideh, creator of Liyla and the Shadows of War and the forthcoming Dreams on a Pillow. Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dreams-on-a-pillows-developer-on-the-challenges-of-making-games-from-the-west-bank">interviewed Abueideh about the latter game last year</a> - amongst other things, they discussed the absence of support structures for Palestinian game developers in the occupied West Bank. "You need to experiment many things, and you have to make many iterations to reach something that is beautiful and people can actually enjoy," Abueideh told Nic. "And to do this, you need an ecosystem that helps you."
</p>
<p>If you'd like to apply for support from the network, you can do so via <a href="https://forms.gle/U6goepMRjowgJN2U6">this form</a>. If you'd like to sign up as a volunteer, you can do so <a href="https://forms.gle/hHKjnMYMjmo3dDmo7">here</a>.
</p>
<p>The games industry at large has a... complicated relationship with Palestine. While many large publishers <a href="https://newsroom.activisionblizzard.com/p/supporting-the-ukrainian-people-mar">halted</a> <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2dkkIG51BCP24JwGGvDry9/how-ubisoft-is-supporting-our-teams-and-the-people-of-ukraine">game</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/update-on-electronic-arts-titles-in-russia-and-belarus">sales</a> in Russia following the outbreak of a murderous invasion of Ukraine, there hasn't been a similar wave of divestment from Israel, even given some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/28/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-say-israel-based-human-rights-groups">well-supported accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide</a>.
</p><p>In particular, Microsoft and Xbox are the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">a boycott</a> in response to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">alleged collaborations</a> with the Israeli military to surveil and target Palestinians using cloud technology and generative AI. Nic and I recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">interviewed a number of people participating in the boycott</a>, amongst them a former Microsoft developer who called attention to Microsoft's "double standard" toward internal discussion of Israel and Palestine. Microsoft declined to comment on this allegation when approached by RPS.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-went-for-the-iphone-7-this-official-2-pack-of-20w-chargers-costs-only-11.1302621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Purchasing chargers is just as overwhelming as buying the phone itself. Apple actually sells and endorses Anker products in their own retail stores, so that says a lot about how much confidence the brand has established. And ight now, Anker’s 20W fast USB-C charger (the exact power rate needed to fast charge iPhones such as Apple’s new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro) is available on Amazon basically impossible to pass up. With the coupon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">you can obtain a 2-pack with cables for just $11, down from $19</a>. That’s<strong> basically $6 per charger</strong>, when Apple charges an identical standalone version for $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Charger Deal Is Too Good To Pass Up</h2>
<p>If you’ve owned an iPhone in the past few years, you may have noticed that <strong>Apple started no longer putting wall chargers in the box</strong>. Now, you’re stuck either paying Apple’s own adapter for way too much or settling for slower, less convenient knockoffs. The Anker 20W fast charger solves that problem without cutting corners. It’s certified and just as reliable as the official Apple version – except you’re paying a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Beyond the obvious savings, the performance is what you’d expect from a charger in 2025. The 20W output gives you the charging speeds that newer iPhones are built to handle. Insert an iPhone 15/16/17, and y<strong>ou can fuel up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes</strong>. The<strong> included USB-C to USB-C cable</strong> ensures you’re set from the start without hunting down extra accessories, and it’s Apple-certified for safety and reliability.</p>
<p>A <strong>USB-C and a USB-A port are both included</strong> in every charger block, so you can charge two devices at once (your iPhone and your AirPods, for example) without sacrificing charging speed. It’s small enough to throw into a pocket or travel case, so you don’t have to spend much time thinking about what’s going on before you head out of the house.</p>
<p>Anker also gives you peace of mind with its MultiProtect safety system. That’s a <strong>multi-layered system that guards against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits</strong>. It’s the type of feature that you don’t even consider until you need it, and it’s another reason why Apple feels comfortable to recommend this brand.</p>
<p>At this price, the deal is more than an accommodation: It’s about having a sufficient number of chargers where you need them. You leave one at home, the other in your pocket so that you never end up digging around in the office or airport lounge. And at about 6 dollars an item, you can equip both locations for under the cost of a single Apple adapter.</p>
