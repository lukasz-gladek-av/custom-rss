			<p>THE BROTHERHOOD, an independent game development studio based in Cape Town, South Africa, and known for the games STASIS and <a href="https://wccftech.com/beautiful-desolation-kickstarter-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beautiful Desolation</a>, has recently announced a new game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Use Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike their previous titles, which were point-and-click isometric adventure games, Animal Use Protocol is a full-fledged 3D first-person horror game made in Unreal Engine 5. The trailer already shows excellent visuals and the preliminary PC system requirements are suitably high.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1080 or AMD Radeon RX 580</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: To Achieve a solid 30FPS at default Settings.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 30 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 4070 or AMD RX 7900 XT</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 30 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em></p>
<p>As you might have guessed already from the game's title, Animal Usage Control is heavily themed around animals. You'll play as a highly intelligent chimpanzee called Penn who is attempting an escape from a laboratory where animals are being experimented on. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulator, and a scrappy rat sidekick called Trip, you'll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station while being relentlessly pursued by all sorts of monstrous experiments gone wrong.</p>

<p>The developers also promised highly immersive environments, exploration-driven gameplay with interactive objects and environmental storytelling, intense and unscripted encounters with a terrifying enemy, limited resources and inventory management for high-stakes decision-making, and voiced dialogue and audio logs for deep narrative immersion. Development on Animal Use Control started in December 2023 and is scheduled to launch on PC in the latter half of 2026, while a console launch will come later.</p>

</div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stationeers">Stationeers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icarus">Icarus</a> developers RocketWerkz are making a spiritual successor to beloved space sim Kerbal Space Program, which is currently titled "Kitten Space Agency" in a flagrant display of adherence to wholesome internet trends. It's based on an actual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> pitch the studio threw at Take-Two subsidiary Private Division back in the day. RocketWerkz CEO and original DayZ creator Dean Hall has hired several former KSP and KSP2 developers to work on the game, and is describing it on social media as a "KSP killer".</p> <!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure KSP2, at least, needs to be "killed" at this point. The sequel - which once thrilled with talk of interstellar travel and lightyear-wide braking manouevres - appears to have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">abandoned</a>, with Take-Two gutting developers Intercept Games back in May. Still, I'm happy to learn that somebody else is wrestling with the important problem of how you simulate an entire solar system without blowing up your office.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Hall - who has made KSP mods in the past - has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/ksa_the_ksp_replacement_from_rocketwerkz_seamless/">posted about the new game on Reddit</a>, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-18">passed on</a> by tireless Maw feeder MiniMatt. "Our studio actually was in the bidding to make KSP2 and we made it to the top three bids," Hall writes in the thread. "The final step was a call [with] Private Division.</p><p>"I put a lot of work with into a good design document and opted to keep the focus entirely on this design and the technical aspects of the project," he continues. "This was a serious problem for two of the people on the call who said we were the only pitch that did not contain art. Obviously our studio wasn't chosen." (I have fixed a couple of Hall's typos here, because I am nice.)</p>
<p>The studio's catlike KSP slayer/reviver is being made with a set of in-house C# development tools, the BRUTAL Framework, which RocketWerkz feistily advertise as being "complicated, slow, and difficult to use". The key asset of the BRUTAL Framework seems to be that it lets developers and modders work directly with your GPU via the Vulkan API, allowing for "tremendous" scale.</p>
<p>There's a fair bit of technical detail in that Reddit thread, a mix of game engine specifics and abbreviated ruminations about physics. I fear to quote much of it in case I capitalise the wrong letter and accidentally delete my computer, or switch off local gravity. A lot of it is tilted towards modders: there are a few modders on the KSA team. But hidden in amongst phrases like "dealing with floating point precision loss" there is some chat about the project's direction and features for us regular, Earth-dwelling folks.</p>
<p>Hall <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun4djj/">says</a> they're aiming "To replicate the same feeling, commitment, and challenge of existing KSP", because "base KSP is a great compromise between many factors when it comes to scale, and so we are not trying to reinvent that". Instead, they're focusing on "solid datastructures" and "ease of development for modders". They're planning to include off-world base building, life support systems, multiplayer functionality, and seamless movement between screens with no loading breaks during multicraft space missions.</p><p>The current builds use real-life solar system data for testing purposes, but the developers aim to construct their very own solar system for the game. The ship-building elements will be familiar, but RocketWerkz want to expand it with combinable "subparts" such as fairings and small tanks. And yes, Hall says the game currently has kitten characters, though that may change. "I think a certain amount of whimsy is important," he notes.</p>
<p>One reachier goal is to add an n-body physics system. I'm going to screw up describing this, but essentially, an n-body physics system dynamically simulates the relationships between bodies based on gravity, rather than "baking in" their motions. It's very hard to do this without dropping planets everywhere like balls of wool. RocketWerkz say there's a "small chance" of RocketWerkz developing such a simulation internally - they're currently trying to hire somebody with a PhD to apply the requisite high-density brain-magic - but it's likely this will be left for modders to figure out.</p>
<p>RocketWerkz won't charge for the first version of KSA, because Hall feels that KSP players are justifiably wary of committing to anything new and KSP-ish, after the disappointment of KSP2. "I think the community is very burned out," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun9mwq/">comments</a>. "Which is why the first version of KSA will be free, so people can try it out before wanting to follow progress and then later buying it when it releases." The initial release won't have any DRM, either.</p>
<p>You might wonder what Kerbal Space Program rights holders Take-Two Interactive make of all this. Are RocketWerkz concerned about getting sued for copyright theft or patent infringement? Not at all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/luncebw/">says</a> Hall. "They are welcome to try! Would be some great publicity for us. Also, I'm very bitter as I think they are a terrible company. So bring it on! We have great lawyers." Well then.</p><p>As for when they'll share more - Hall says modders should get "behind-the-scenes access late this year or early next to initial builds for feedback". Hall's hope is that open access might follow "maybe mid next year". In the Reddit thread he stresses that "it is critical to be skeptical" of a project this complex, so by all means drop into that thread and hold his feet to the fire. I'll just carry on tending to Spaceship RPS in the starless void of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">temporarily suspended comments</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>‘s SMGs are excellent for close-quarters combat, especially on the smaller maps. The PP-919 is among the strongest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons in BO6</a> due to its large magazine and all-around balanced stats.</p>



<p>For those looking to leverage the PP-919, here’s the best loadout for the SMG in Black Ops 6, packed with the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you should be using.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-pp-919-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-pp-919">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-is-the-pp-919-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the PP-919 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-pp-919-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best PP-919 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Ergonomic Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> No Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The PP-919 is an SMG that can perform well at close and even medium ranges in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>. So, to empower its strengths, the <strong>Merlin Mini</strong> Optic will provide a clean sight for you to take on enemies outside of close range, while the <strong>Suppressor </strong>keeps you off the enemy minimap and the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> boosts the gun’s damage range and bullet velocity.</p>



<p>Lastly, the <strong>Ergonomic Grip</strong> and <strong>No Stock</strong> attachments will both improve the weapon’s mobility and handling. This means you can get the first shot off quickly after sprinting and avoid bullets by strafing faster.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-pp-919">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for PP-919</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>For Perks, we’ve chosen <strong>Ninja </strong>for a more silent approach, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for more minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> so that you know when your position has been exposed. These three provide the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, giving you wallhacks when you spawn and a HUD indicator for when you’re spotted.</p>



<p>The <strong>Perk Greed Wildcard </strong>allows us to choose one more, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket</strong> incredibly useful as it has saved my life many times by reducing enemy explosive damage, especially when capturing objectives.</p>



<p>You’ll want some solid Equipment to compliment the best PP-919 loadout in Black Ops 6, hence why we’ve selected the tried and tested <strong>Frag </strong>and the <strong>Stim Shot</strong>, which keeps you topped up on health straight after a fight. Finally, the <strong>Trophy System</strong> is a solid pick for any game mode, blocking the opposition team’s Equipment to better you and your team’s survival.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-pp-919">Best Secondary for PP-919</h2>



<p>My favorite Secondary for the P-919 is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>. It’s the only fully automatic Pistol in Black Ops 6, making it the best option for close-range gunfights and when you just need to land a couple more shots on the enemy.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock PP-919 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the PP-919 in BO6 by hitting <strong>Level 37</strong>. This may take some grinding, but you should get there fairly fast by playing objective-based modes and completing daily challenges as much as possible.</p>



<p>You can always check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/">how to level up your Rank</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/">weapons fast</a> for more tips too.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-pp-919-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the PP-919 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the PP-919 is one of the meta SMGs in Black Ops 6 thanks to its large 64-round base magazine, which frees up space for an attachment elsewhere. It also has extremely easy-to-control recoil and decent damage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to PP-919 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for an alternative, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a> is another SMG that performs well at medium range, providing a slower fire rate to balance it out. If you want something much more close-range, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kompakt-92-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kompakt 92</a> has an extremely fast fire rate, dropping enemies in rapid fashion when in close-quarters combat.</p>

It will be interesting to see how Black Ops 6 stacks up in terms of unit sales, but that comparison won't be perfect, of course, because many people will play Black Ops 6 on Game Pass without buying the game outright. But people are buying Call of Duty games--and lots of them. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, the Call of Duty series has now passed 500 million copies sold since the franchise debuted in 2003.</p><p>For comparison, that's ahead of the <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9eb38a0e-f871-4c59-8af2-c0c41ca99c07" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">430 million lifetime sales of GTA games</a>. This figure is poised to grow in a big way soon, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6 launches in 2025.</a></p><p>Big numbers for Black Ops 6 were expected prior to launch. Not only is the Black Ops brand highly popular, but the game launched into Game Pass, a much-discussed move that seems to have paid off in the short term for Microsoft.</p><p>Before this, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he anticipated Call of Duty helping to drive Game Pass subscribers for Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">only for a period of time.</a> As Zelnick sees it, releasing a major new game into a subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">makes little sense and is a "lost opportunity" for sales.</a> Zelnick, of course, runs a third-party publisher and has his own set of unique opinions for his business that might not compare directly to Microsoft's own business objectives.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Black Ops 6 expands this week with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">highly anticipated Nuketown multiplayer map on November 1</a>. After that, Black Ops 6 Season 1 begins on November 14, and this also includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Call of Duty: Warzone's newest map, Area 99.</a></p><p>For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer reviews.</a></p>

            <p>Toby Fox has assured fans that the next two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> chapters will be released next year. In fact, the developer is "100 percent" on that.</p>
<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>. A second free instalment then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">arrived in September 2021</a>, and the promise of more to come followed. We are still to actually get our hands on the next chapter, however, but Fox has now shared a small morsel of an update on its arrival.</p>

<p>After sharing a Deltarune image for Halloween on social media platform X, the developer went on to state that he was "very eager" to share what's being worked on.</p>
<p>Fox said chapters three and four would "100 percent come out in 2025". However, the developer couldn't give a more specific time frame right now, due to "localisation and console porting" on the development side of things. In October of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-release-strategy-altered-will-be-available-to-purchase-sooner">Fox said chapter three was "content complete"</a>.</p>
<p>"Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in," Fox's post closed. Well, it is Halloween.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">previous plan</a> was to release chapters three, four and five of Deltarune together, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/two-point-museums-supernatural-ghostology-exhibits-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A fresh exhibit and location has been revealed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, the latest quirky management game in the Two Point series, with Ghostology featuring spooks, spectres, the undead and more. Two Point Museum is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/two-point-museum-curates-a-march-2025-release-date/">4th March 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With all the tongue-in-cheek japes and jokes sprinkled throughout the game, it’s good fun to try and spot all the references in the trailer. I definitely spotted a The Ring TV set, a haunted puppet and more generic floating tables and poltergeists.</p>
<p>This range of exhibits will be most heavily featured in the Wailon Lodge level, an old holiday hotel that lies in ruins, until you turn up to turn it into a supernatural museum. The Lodge will see you join up with Winston Wailon to curate a bunch of exhibits throughout, with Polterguest Rooms to invite spirits to be residents and expeditions to the Netherworld Rift to bring back historic remnants and creepy relics.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that, as quirky and fun as the exhibits might look, this probably isn’t a museum you want to spend a night at!</p>
<p>Wailon Lodge joins previously revealed locations at Memento Mile and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tI85pecH1g">Passwater Cove</a>, with Two Point Studios cooking up a bunch of inventive levels that you might consider turning into a museum.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>

            <p>Two Point Studios has announced the next museum type coming to its forthcoming Two Point Museum, and it's a spooky one in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>Yes, players will be able to manage their very own supernatural museum in the form of Wailon Lodge and its Ghostology exhibits.</p>
<p>This remote, old-fashioned and haunted location in Two Point County is far from a cosy holiday destination, but with the help of "ghostly front-of-house" Winston Wailon, players will transform the hotel into an eerie museum.</p>

<p>Of course, the big question is what sort of exhibits will we be able to put on show?</p>
<p>In this museum, players can create "immersive Polterguest Rooms to turn wandering spirits into museum guests", while expeditions into the Netherworld Rift will yield new exhibits and relics.</p>
<p>The trailer above also shows levitating furniture, a giant man-eating plant, and ectoplasm splatters. So, plenty of ways to scare the crap out of museumgoers, then.</p>
<p>Ghostology joins the already-revealed prehistoric and aquarium exhibits. I'm still hoping for an art gallery heist level, personally.</p>

<p>Ahead of the game's reveal, I spoke with design director Ben Huskins and executive producer Jo Koehler on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">how Two Point Museum develops the series formula</a> from Hospital and Campus to mix the mundane and the whacky.</p>
<p>"We have some stuff that is grounded in reality," said Huskins, "so we obviously look at what are the sorts of things people would expect to see in a museum, because we always want that grounding. But then we have those slightly more out-there things that make sense in the world of Two Point County.</p>
<p>"It's about getting that variety, both in terms of what these cool exhibits look like but also how they behave and how the player interacts with them."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>From developers Cannibal Interactive, the creators of Purgatory Dungeoneer, springs forth a new labyrinth game. This one is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/labyrinth-of-wild-abyss-layeredux">Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux</a> and it has labyrinths. Except the labyrinths don't just have single paths to their centres, but tube monsters covered in eyes who'll stalk you slowly and methodically as you meander. Personally, it's not the vibe I'm after when I sit down in the evening and I think, "I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant". But hey, it might be for you.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>LayeRedux is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, then. A horror game that's less focused on jump scares and more on the feeling of being lost and not knowing what's around the next corner. There are <em>lots</em> of corners, spread across 50 handcrafted labyrinths with multiple floors, all kitted out with a single monster that'll kill you instantly if they touch you. Think you've lost them? Nah, sorry, you've probably passed an eye on the wall that would've alerted them to your precise location. You can't outsmart them. You can't have a nice chat with them. "There is no hope but to run", says the Steam page.</p>
<p>Moments of respite can be found at toilets, which also act as save points. It's here where the monsters can't get you. Although, these toilets can't be found on every floor of a labyrinth, so you best be careful.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux", a horror game about paranoia and persistence predation, is now out on Steam for $2.99! Enjoy vast hand-crafted labyrinths and the despair of escape! There is no reasoning with Monsters. There is no hope but to run.<a href="https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg">https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg</a> <a href="https://t.co/hml3yeO11h">pic.twitter.com/hml3yeO11h</a></p>— Damien Crawford (@TheWorstRPGDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWorstRPGDev/status/1851882608730460642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>I've not seen the film It Follows, but I've heard that it has a similar schtick? From what I gather, something in a human guise will follow you to the ends of the earth at a normal walking pace. So you could be at a train station looking up at the notice boards, when all of a sudden you notice a person staring directly at you and gently shoving others aside without breaking eye contact. That'll be the monster. And if they catch up with you: you die. I think that's a far from ideal situation and LayeRedux only goes and puts you directly in the monster's lair. No thanks.</p>
<p>But if you're like, "Yes thanks", then you can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3285660/Labyrinth_of_Wild_Abyss_LayeRedux/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian is celebrating 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>).</p>
<p>In a post on social media, the developer shared a playful gif showing off the impressive download number. It also left us with this interesting little factoid. Apparently of those 50m downloads, 10k of those were players renaming Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity, Withers.</p>
<p>And, what are people renaming him? Well, Bone Daddy, of course! "So, uh, glad we could facilitate that," Larian wrote in its post.</p>

<p>We knew mods were a hit for Baldur's Gate 3 players already. In fact, in less than 24 hours of mod support going live on PC, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">developer announced more than 1m mods had been installed</a>.</p>
<p>Mod support then came to console and Mac players in October, when the team revealed over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-says-baldurs-gate-3-console-mods-smashing-records-just-a-week-after-release">1.7m mods were downloaded in the first 24 hours of release on consoles</a>.</p>

<p>The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has launched Nintendo Music, a new music download and streaming app for your smartphone with access to a library of the company's top video game tunes. 
</p>
<p>
Available now via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iPhone App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a>, the app requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to let you mooch around with Mario or pick up your morning jog with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music features playlists from dozens of Nintendo games across the years, with more to be added over time. You can play themes from specific games, or from playlists themed around certain Nintendo characters, music genres and moods. 
</p>

<p>
There's also the ability to curate your playlists, and hide music from games you haven't played (or don't want to hear) via a Spoiler function. 
</p>
<p>
Best of all, tracks can be extended (you can choose from either 15 minutes, 30 minutes or a full hour) allowing you to bliss out to some relaxing Animal Crossing or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> vibes all night long. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has increasingly taken a sterner stance towards the hosting of its music elsewhere on the internet, and the decision to provide an official source for its tunes (and the ability to extend them - an offering that is a YouTube favourite) is an interesting step. 
</p>
<p>
So far, Nintendo Music hosts music from: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Splatoon 3</li>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies</li>

<li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>

<li>Lylat Wars (Starfox 64)</li>
</ul>

<p>

            <p>The creative director of Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game has moved across to Xbox, and joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox">Game File</a>, Brian Horton hasn't been part of the PlayStation Marvel project since the summer. Horton was announced to be serving as Wolverine's creative director back in 2021.</p>
<p>The game will now be led by Marcus Smith, who has taken on the role of creative director in Horton's stead. Mike Daly is Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain will remain with Insomniac, but will serve in a different role. Smith and Daly previously worked together on Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as creative director and game director.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the matter, the recent changes on the Wolverine development team are "the result of creative decisions around the game".</p>
<p>Following his departure from Playstation, Horton has now moved to Xbox, where he has joined the Perfect Dark reboot team as creative director. Horton will be "bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series," an Xbox representative said.</p><p>We finally got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">gameplay for the Perfect Dark reboot back in June</a> during an Xbox showcase, four years after the game's initial announcement. The reboot is being co-developed by Microsoft's The Initiative and Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics (where Horton once worked on Tomb Raider). In May, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">described as still being in a "very rough state"</a>.</p>
<p>There's still no release window for the Perfect Dark reboot yet but it'll be a day one Game Pass title when it arrives.</p>
<p>As for Wolverine, it was first announced in several years ago, but little official has been heard about the project since. </p><p>In 2023, Insomniac was subject to a cyber attack, following which people were playing - and uploading footage - of an<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version"> incomplete early development build of the game</a>, found within the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files stolen from the developer by ransomware hackers</a>. Insomniac issued a statement following this incident stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-issues-statement-addressing-hack">Like Logan... Insomniac is resilient</a>."</p>

		<p>Nintendo has launched a brand new Nintendo Music app, putting a big bundle of game soundtracks into the hands of Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.</p>
<p>That’s right, hot on the heels of that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/09/nintendo-alarmo-is-an-alarm-clock-and-not-switch-2/">alarm clock</a>, this is a new perk for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online, letting us all more legitimately delve into the soundtracks for a good selection of Nintendo games – as opposed to, you know, just looking them up on YouTube.</p>


<p>There’s some modern greats included, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> sure to get an awful lot of playtime, but you can also head back to all-timers like the original Super Mario Bros., Metroid, and fan favourites with Nintendogs and the Wii Channels music – yes, the music from the console menus, from when Nintendo still had fun console menus.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this is great, and I can’t wait to see how Nintendo will expand and grow the line up. Sure, they can fill out the library with more obvious soundtracks, but I’d love to see some oddments like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/17/cadence-of-hyrule-review/">Cadence of Hyrule collaboration</a> make an appearance, and collaborations with third parties.</p>

<p>The full line up of soundtracks and games is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Country (Super NES)</li>
<li>Dr. Mario (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade (Game Boy Advance</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Kirby’s Dream Land (Game Boy)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64)</li>
<li>Lylat Wars (Nintendo 64)</li>
<li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo Switch)</li>

			<p>Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=150949805&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> via Game File that the Perfect Dark reboot recently added a new Creative Director: Brian Horton. He's an industry veteran with credits dating back all the way to Disney: Pocahontas, released in 1996 for the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive console.</p>
<p>Most of his credits are in the art department. He was, for instance, the Senior Art Director for Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider while at Crystal Dynamics. Horton then switched to a Creative Director position when he did a couple of years <a href="http://wccftech.com/rise-tomb-raider-art-director-leaves-crystal-dynamics-join-infinity-ward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Infinity Ward</a> and kept the same role when he joined Insomniac to work on Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. More recently, he was the creative director of the upcoming game Marvel's Wolverine, which Horton <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolverine-ps5-full-size-mature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> briefly three years ago. Given that the Perfect Dark game is largely being developed at Crystal Dynamics in a joint venture with The Initiative, this is a return home for Horton. An Xbox spokesperson told Game File:</p>
<p><em>Brian Horton will be bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series.</em></p>
<p>We finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got </a>our first look at the game during this Summer's Xbox Games Showcase. The gameplay trailer was definitely promising and we also learned a few concrete details. The developers have taken inspiration from elements of the first two installments while creating an entirely new story and universe for the reboot.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark will be a single-player experience with a set of missions that offer various choices on how players complete them. Traversal and gadgets are going to be very important. The focus was on creating an intuitive movement system to let players find interesting ways to tackle their tasks. The combat system has been designed to allow for both melee and gunplay, stealth, and gadgets. Supposedly, the development teams want to blend elements from first-person shooters, immersive simulations, and stealth games into a cohesive whole, delivering a complete secret agent fantasy.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark doesn't have a release date yet, but it will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X. As all games developed by studios owned by Microsoft, it will be available on Game Pass from day one. As for Marvel's Wolverine, Horton has been replaced by Marcus Smith as the new Creative Director for Insomniac's game.</p>

            <p>Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-4-release-date-trailer-details-theories-and-predictions">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, <a href="https://x.com/ChachiBobinks/status/1851307428656161158">specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’</a>. Here’s a clip:</p>

<p>Violet McVinnie, currently of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> studio Long Way Home and previously a cinematographer at Bioware on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, has chimed in to speak about the animation.</p>
<p>“Ex Bioware dev here,” <a href="https://x.com/VioletMcVinnie/status/1851558624461496555">wrote McVinnie</a>. “I'm responsible for some of the "Bioware Turns". This anim is part of a set called "Posebreakers" which are intended to move characters around the area if a scene is feeling too static. We'd combine them with the infamous "Exit Left/Right" between cuts.”</p><p>People in McVinnie’s replies are also curating a collection of their favourite Bioware-isms, including 'flick of the wrist accusatory point', 'walk away nonchalantly while looking back over the shoulder', ‘worried forehead rub’, and ‘aggressive headshake after drinking alcohol’ (“just from the mocap recording”, says McVinnie).</p>
<p>One player asked why “everyone in Mass Effect break(s) eye contact and look(s) off to the side when handing objects to people?”, to which McVinnie replied “if it’s the hand off anim I think it is, it was baked into the animation file before we started using it. Not sure of the origin. Many animations propagate through lots of Bioware franchises. ME3's Thane/Kai Leng fight cutscene has a lot of Jade Empire combat animations stitched together.” We do love to see a bit of canny asset reuse.</p>
<p>I done wrote Wot I Think about Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">here</a>. In short: It’s not much of an RPG, and its action wears thin sooner than I’d have liked, but it’s got such heart and enthusiasm it won me right over by the end. Oh, I just remembered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">comments are temporarily down</a>, too! Sera best companion. Dragon Age 2 wasn’t that great. Anyone moaning about Marvel dialogue in the new game, fair enough, but I must ask if you’ve somehow erased Alistair from your memory. Happy Veilguard day to those who celebrate, and happy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3184110/Widget_Inc/">Widget Inc</a> day to those who don't.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey (2017)</a> studio Arkane Austin - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">alongside a handful of others</a> - back in May.</p>
<p>Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsoft-closing-arkane-austin-was-a-dumb-move-says-founder-and-former-president">for PC Gamer</a> about Arkane’s closure, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The rules that they play, we might not understand them. It's a different thing. It's hard to know why they did what they did,” said Colantonio. "The only thing that I stand by is saying that the specific choice of killing Arkane Austin, that was not a good decision."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Recreating a very special group like that is, I would dare to say, impossible. It takes forever. When you have that magic of Harvey [Smith] and Ricardo [Bare] etc that all come together, it's a specific moment in time and space that just worked out this way, that took forever to reach. Those people together can really make magic. It's not like, 'Doesn't matter, we'll just rehire.' No, try it. That's what big groups do all the time. They try to just hire massively and overpay people to create those magic groups. It doesn't work like this. So to me, that was stupid. But what do I know?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Arkane Lyon - the original 1999 French studio from which Arkane Austin spun off in 2006 - are currently at work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-blade">Marvel’s Blade</a> - the last we saw of it was some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkane-release-new-marvels-blade-concept-artworks-hinting-at-missions-combat-and-levels">concept art</a> last December. WolfEye’s next project is an “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">evolution of Prey and Dishonored”</a>, and it sounds great. We’re currently expecting a ‘limited private alpha test’ next year. In August, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> studio Tango - shuttered by Xbox at the same time as Arkane Austin - had been rescued, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">in a manner of speaking</a>, by Plunkbatters Krafton.</p>

			<p>Early signs on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 sales and overall reception were great, and now we have confirmation from Microsoft and Activision. During the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1 2025 earnings</a> call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that the game set new franchise records and also helped the Game Pass subscription service reach records of its own.</p>
<p><em>One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger.</em></p>
<p><em>Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day 1 players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</em></p>
<p>Granted, there were little doubts in both cases. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is, after all, the first new game in the franchise to launch day and date on Game Pass, which would inevitably have expanded its player base (and the subscription service's user base). The bigger question is whether, in the long term, this will be financially beneficial compared to the traditional way the game has been sold before the massive acquisition.</p>
<p>Activision is also celebrating, of course. The official X account revealed that, unsurprisingly, Black Ops 6 has registered the biggest opening weekend ever for Call of Duty in terms of total players, hours played, and total matches. Moreover, the publisher <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> The Washington Post that the first-person shooter franchise has now surpassed 500 million units since its debut twenty-one years ago.</p>

<p>After a 14-year-long wait, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> has finally released their 2010 hit title, Red Dead Redemption, on PC. So, if you’re looking for a fresh start to John Marston’s story, don’t forget to implement these best PC graphics settings during your playthrough.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-graphics-settings-for-red-dead-redemption-on-pc">Best Graphics Settings for Red Dead Redemption on PC</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-video">Video</h3>

<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Native monitor resolution</li>

<li><strong>V-Sync</strong>: On</li>



<li><strong>Triple Buffering</strong>: Off</li>

<li><strong>Tree Level of Detail</strong>: Full</li>



<li><strong>Tree Draw Distance</strong>: Full</li>



<li><strong>Grass Level of Detail</strong>: Full</li>
</ul>



<p>Considering Red Dead Redemption is over a decade-old game, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> are more on the demanding side. However, even if you have somewhat dated hardware, you can still enjoy the game at higher frames without losing quality. Just use the settings mentioned above.</p>



<p>Unlike Red Dead Redemption 2, where the graphics options are much more robust, you don’t get that in this game. But to get the optimal performance, you can tweak it a little bit as per your liking.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-0-15-5-patch-brings-fall-weather-%E2%80%98matching-inventory%E2%80%99-and-more.1023906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-15-5-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s latest patch – 0.15.5.0 – is being implemented today, October 31. It’s bursting with features and changes, but it’ll take the game offline for several hours while it’s being deployed and tested. One of the standout tweaks to the game coming with 0.15.5 is the introduction of fall weather – which means we’re one step away from winter and that damned snow.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-tarkov-s-0-15-5-patch">What’s in Tarkov’s 0.15.5 Patch?</h2>



<p>Tarkov’s 0.15.5 update has plenty packed into it.</p>



<p>First, there’s the switch to fall weather, marked by orange and brown leaves and foliage, crispy terrain underfoot, and low-sitting sunscapes that blind you at the wrong moment every time. In a few weeks, we’ll get <strong>late </strong>fall, which is a different thing entirely. It’s the preface to winter, so it’s not long until we get snow back in Tarkov.</p>



<p>One of the best features being added with the 0.15.5 patch is the ability to interact with your stash, profile, and even the Flea Market while matching. It’s limited to the earliest phase of matching, which means you’ll need to move quickly, but it’s expected it’ll be expanded later as a feature.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ll now get in-game rewards for unlocking certain achievements. These rewards won’t disappear when you undergo a wipe – once you’ve got them, you’ve unlocked them for life. For instance, if you completed the full Tarkov Mystery event, you’ll unlock the ‘Mr Kerman’s Cat Hologram’ item.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to pin items in the stash following the rollout of the 0.15.5 patch. You’ll also be able to lock items, preventing you from accidentally using or selling them. </p>



<p>Battlestate Games has also adjusted transition points, introduced new shotguns and attachments for a string of assault rifles, and fixed various bugs and issues in the game.</p>



<p>Is this a solid Tarkov update? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Under the rule of two great kingdoms, the continent of Maygard once enjoyed a period of prosperity.</p><p>However, that prosperity became a thing of the past once the continent came under attack from the Demon King Hamehameha and her formidable magical power… Since then, humanity has gradually been losing ground to the Demon King’s forces.</p><p>With the survival of humanity at stake, a Hero arises to defeat the Demon King.

With humanity’s last hope lost, it seemed like the world was all but in the hands of the Demon Lord…</p><p>In his fading state of consciousness, the Hero extends his arm towards his captured party members. In that moment, the Hero hears a voice pleading for help somewhere deep in the darkness.</p><p>“Someone please help me…”</p><p>Drawn to the voice, the Hero’s spirit is summoned by Julietta, a princess from a faraway land being held prisoner in the Demon King’s castle. The two quickly figure out that Julietta’s desire to escape and the Hero’s desire to rescue his party members are aligned with one another.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_925090"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Julietta</strong> (voiced by Moe Toyota) – A mysterious princess the Hero meets in the Demon Castle. Uses summoning magic to summon the hero Hero to aid her escape from the Demon Castle. According to herself, the princess of a small and isolated island kingdom off the coast of the continent of Maygard. Having had very little contact with others, she has long dreamed of making friends. Because of this background, while Julietta rarely initiates conversation she always makes sure to properly answer when someone speaks to her, even if in an awkward manner. While she may be an introvert, that does not mean she is bad at communicating.</li><li><strong>Aria</strong> (voiced by Mao Amatsuka) – The princess of Aria Zaza, one of the two great kingdoms of the Maygard Continent. Having led a sheltered childhood, Aria has been insulated from most knowledge of the real world. While soft-spoken, she harbors a deep desire for a peaceful world in which everyone can live happily. While prone to making ditzy remarks, Aria posesses a gifted mind and sometimes surprises those around her with her logical arguments and astute oberservations. She is also exceptionally well-trained in magic. While on the journey to defeat the Demon King, she runs into Demon King Hamehameha and is taken away to the Demon Castle.</li><li><strong>Zena</strong> (voiced by Fumiko Uchimura) – The princess of Zanji Zard, one of the two great kingdoms of the Maygard Continent. She trains in swordsmanship daily and her skills are second-to-none! Being afraid of nobody and lacking restraint, she may flip between insulting the Hero in one moment and joking around with him the next. Says this and that, but in the end finds herself drawn to the Hero. While on the journey to defeat the Demon King, she runs into Demon King Hamehameha and is taken away to the Demon Castle.</li><li><strong>Charlotte</strong> (voiced by Yuki Tanaka) – A stern female knight who swore her allegiance to Aria. A leader-like figure to the group, always troubled by the other girls’ freewheeling <a title="Genres > Action [2,283 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. A keen and observant person, Charlotte understands the strengths and weaknesses of each party member and is able to give out orders appropriate to the situation, displaying her talent as a commander. While calm, collected, and able to be relied on most of the time, when Charlotte loses control of her emotions she loses sight of her surroundings, often repeating the phrase “Ugh, kill me!”</li><li><strong>Finanche</strong> (voiced by Honoka Inoue) – A mage from the kingdom of Aria Zaza. An apprentice to the sage who previously accompanied the Hero on his journey. Having lost her parents at a young age, Finanche was raised by the sage in their stead. To Finanche, the sage is both her master and a parental figure. In order to pay back the sage for having raised her, Finanche studied hard to become a skilled mage. Because of this past, she blames the Hero for the death of the sage and looks down on him as lacking in ability.</li><li><strong>Chouquette</strong> (voiced by Ayumi Mano) – A dark <a title="Companies > elf [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/elf">elf</a> and former bandit who now serves Aria. Becoming a bandit in order to provide for her kind, hated and looked down upon by the citizens of Aria Zaza, Chouquette was apprehended by Charlotte and became a prisoner awaiting execution. However, Aria, upon hearing the struggles of Chouquette and the dark elves, extended her support to them and spared Chouquette’s life on the condition that she become Aria’s personal guard. Moved by Aria’s open-heartedness, Chouquette pledged her loyalty to Aria.</li><li><strong>Demon King Hamehameha</strong> (voiced by Mikoi Sasaki) – The Demon King that reigns over the Maygard Continent. The very culprit that screwed the Hero’s party in the Demon Castle. Cold, calculative, and condescending towards human life, she has no reservations about killing. In addition, she wields powerful magic thanks to her massive magical power.</li></ul><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Guide the Princesses to Escape From the Demon Castle!</strong> – Since you, the hero, have no physical body, you cannot search for or solve traps on your own. Instead, you must guide the captured princesses to uncover the castle’s many puzzles, rescue your party members, and escape! Depending on your choices, the fates of the princesses could change dramatically!</li><li><strong>Use the Hints and Items You Find to Solve the Castle’s Many Puzzles!</strong> – You’ll need to deal with a plethora of traps and puzzles to free the princesses from the Demon Castle. To solve them all, search each room corner-to-corner to collect items and hints! As the hero, your wits and resourcefulness will be tested!</li><li><strong>Rescue the Members of the Hero’s <a title="Genres > Party [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> Who Have Been Screwed!</strong> – At the hands of Demon King Hamehameha, who loves to screw others more than anything in the world, the Hero’s Party have been taken away to the Demon Castle and strewn screwn all over the castle, crying out for help! Try not to be distracted by the unbecoming positions your allies have been placed in, and search for items and hints to rescue them as soon as possible. Suppress your urge to stare at the maidens before you, and fulfill your duty as a Hero to rescue your friends and save the world!</li><li><strong>No Need to Worry About Channel Bans (or Your Mom Walking in)! a Curtain of Light to Protect the Girls’ Precious Parts!</strong> – The configurations menu now boasts “Sensitive Mode,” which you can turn on to have a curtain of light cover up your party members’ precious parts! This mode can be toggled on and off at any time, even during exploration, from the config menu. With this mode active, you won’t have to worry about your streaming, video sharing, or social media accounts getting banned!

New this year is Arcane Embrace, a one-of-a-kind shotgun with a new archetype that fires two slugs with each pull of the trigger instead of one. Especially with its god roll perks, it's an extremely powerful option for leveling tough enemies or dealing boss damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Arcane Embrace is only available during the Festival of the Lost and only from specific sources. Here's how to get it and the god rolls you'll want to chase.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Arcane_Embrace">How To Get Arcane Embrace</a></li><li><a href="#Arcane_Embrace_God_Rolls">Arcane Embrace God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Arcane_Embrace_PvE_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Arcane_Embrace_PvP_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Arcane_Embrace">How To Get Arcane Embrace</h2><p dir="ltr">You can only get Arcane Embrace by completing the Haunted Sectors activity as part of the Festival of the Lost or from event vendor Eva Levante in the Tower. The good news is that you're guaranteed to get an Arcane Embrace just by completing the quick set of quests Eva gives you at the start of the Festival of the Lost to get acclimated to the event--and it's kind of a great one with Trench Barrel and Dual Loader, which you can only get as this reward from Eva. After that, you can play Haunted Sectors for a chance to get Arcane Embrace rolls as rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also decrypt Eerie Engrams, earned from the event, for a chance to get the shotgun to drop from them. Eva offers the ability to "focus" your Eerie Engrams to get specific rewards instead of a random item from the Festival loot pool, so provided you have the Candy to spend, you can guarantee new Arcane Embraces by visiting her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4392798-20241030100339_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4392798-20241030100339_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392798"></a><figcaption>Arcane Embrace</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4392798-20241030100339_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Arcane_Embrace_God_Rolls">Arcane Embrace God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Arcane_Embrace_PvE_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Fluted Barrel or Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Fluted Barrel: Stability +5, Handling +15</li><li dir="ltr">Corkscrew Rifling: +5 Stability, +5 Handling, +5 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Reload Speed +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Fourth Time's the Charm  <ul><li dir="ltr">Rapidly landing precision shots will return two rounds to the magazine.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Surrounded / Precision Instrument  <ul><li dir="ltr">Surrounded: This weapon gains improved bonus damage when three or more targets are in close proximity.</li><li dir="ltr">Precision Instrument: Dealing sustained damage significantly increases precision damage.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling or Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Firing two shots for each pull of the trigger, Arcane Embrace can dish out massive damage very quickly--so the struggle becomes keeping it full of ammo to keep that damage flowing for as long as possible. Focus on increasing your reload speed so you can get the gun loaded quickly, with a secondary emphasis on handling so you can quickly swap to it when needed. Fourth Time's the Charm helps with keeping the gun loaded since you get ammo back for landing precision shots and you can land two hits with each blast. Surrounded and Precision Instrument both do well to add additional damage to the gun. Use Precision Instrument if you're doing well in landing lots of headshots, and Surrounded if you can wade into a group of enemies to do your dirty work. Surrounded offers a more significant damage boost but is generally harder to activate.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, it's worth noting that the Dual Loader / Trench Barrel roll you get from Eva as a quest reward is also pretty great--and you <em>can't</em> get that version from a random roll, at least right now. It's a pretty solid stand-in from these god roll options.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Arcane_Embrace_PvP_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +7, Range +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Steady Rounds / Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Steady Rounds: Stability +15, Range -5, Airborne Effectiveness +7</li><li dir="ltr">Accurized Rounds: +10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts handling and range.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Closing Time  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Stability or Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can do solid work in PvP with Arcane Embrace just with its two shots, but it operates like a slug shotgun, which means precision is important. For that reason, stability is a stat you want to lean into, especially because you can get strong boosts to range through other perks. The benefits of Slideshot--increased range and stability, as well as reloading the magazine--are hard to pass up in the Crucible. Closing Time is also great for boosting stats that will help you win fights, including range, although you need to get the magazine down to at least half to trigger it, so keep that in mind when choosing when to reload.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/lego-islands-mystery-of-the-monolith-wraps-up-with-lego-dark-space/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The LEGO Group is wrapping up a month-long experiment in LEGO Islands within Fortnite with today’s launch of the LEGO Dark Space experience.</p>
<p>LEGO Dark Space is a level that you can find within Fortnite – either in the LEGO Islands section or with the code 5633-3820-8944 – giving players a creepy level to navigate, completing puzzles and challenges to make it through the space station, using lights to avoid monsters, and eventually try to escape.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Islands in Fortnite - LEGO Dark Space" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7vvMsO7wcU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Through the month of October, The Lego Group has launched three custom made experiences within their broad collaboration with Fortnite, first providing a 3D platformer in Lego Parkour Worlds set in the Lego Dreamzzz universe. This was followed by Lego Chasers vs. Hunters, again featuring the Dreamzzz universe as players battle for control over a map, blasting away at world items (and one another) to acquire dream sand. And then there’s Lego Monster Fishing, with a giant tentacle monster beneath the surface of an otherwise calm fishing and town improvement game.</p>
<p>This all feeds into Lego Dark Space –&nbsp;something completely different. Something a bit darker.</p>

<p>Starting off with a tentacled alien terror attacking you and a fellow astronaut on a dusty Mars-like planet, you race to get inside the space station and try to make your way to a rocket to blast off to safety. What stands between you and that rocket, though, is a labyrinth dark and spooky corridors and rooms, aliens on patrol, and some light puzzles to solve.</p>

<p>It’s actually surprisingly effective, shifting to a first person view of a station that’s been constructed entirely out of Lego bricks and chunky Lego props. All you have to hand is a flashlight that lazily follows the direction that you’re looking, and a map of the level that you can use to navigate to each of the puzzles.</p>
<p>With no weapons to hand, you will have to avoid the Lego aliens that patrol the corridors, though their routes don’t intersect with puzzle rooms, giving you safe havens to reach without stress for when you’re solving puzzles. These can be surprisingly inventive, like matching the shadows of objects or blending colours to match, or they can be as simple as hitting a few triggers. Once all 10 have been completed, you’re on to the home stretch.</p>
<p>It can be played solo or in co-op (matchmade or otherwise), with players having five lives that will send you back to the beginning, though with puzzles remaining completed.</p>
<p>It’s all intended as a bit of a demonstration of what the Lego asset kits in Fortnite are able to produce, and in that regard Team Unite has done a good job… though they inevitably butt up into the limitations of Fortnite as a UGC game creating platform. Unreal Engine can create fantastic worlds, but once you’re abstracted from a game engine, it’s difficult to get a truly polished experience.</p>

<p>Flicking to and from the map would often see the world disappear or switch view temporarily back to third person, some of the puzzles are a bit finicky in their style, and as effective as the flashlight lag is for instilling a little bit of fear in you, I can’t be sure it’s truly intentional.</p>
<p>Still, it shows the potential of this creative playground, in combination with the trio of preceding Lego Islands games. And the whole Mystery of the Monolith loosely links the four together with clues and codes in previously released levels that can unlock things in this finale.</p>
<p>It also goes hand in hand with a streaming collaboration, with SypherPK, Lachlan, Loserfruit and Ali-A amongst the first to set foot in the labyrinthine level… and then set to be trapped and imprisoned by the Monolith. Players will be able to follow in their footsteps and then vote on who to release between now and 12th November, with a reward being exclusive&nbsp;Dark Studies and Eternal Restlessness décor bundles.</p>
<p>LEGO’s collaboration with Fortnite has been and intriguing one to watch from afar, combining two things that millions upon millions of children are no doubt obsessed with. This month and the Mystery of the Monolith shows that this partnership can absolutely go further in future.</p>
