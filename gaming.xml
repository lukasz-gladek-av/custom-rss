            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/what-we-played-doom-the-dark-ages-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Another shortened week is in the bag, and for plenty of gamers the weekend can’t come soon enough. Game Pass subscribers in particular are getting a lot of good games of late, with Revenge of the Savage Planet now out on there and DOOM: The Dark Ages set to follow next week.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing both those games this past week, as well as the newly announced grand strategy epic of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/europa-universalis-5-preview-hands-on-eu5/">Europa Universalis V</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>… with me, funnily enough. We had a good fun time running around the multiple angry planets in this quirky Metroidvania sequel, but Dom took the lead and played a good bunch on his own as well. And for more of his alone time, there was Tetris and Spirit of the North 2.</p>

<p>While we’ve come to the end of the review train, <strong>Aran</strong> is closer to the start of his, playing the blacksmithing adventure of Blades of Fire – more on that sometime soonish. He’s also started a new save in Football Manager 24 with Ebbsfleet, who he’s dragged to a playoff spot for promotion to League 2.</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> polished off some reviews of Kiborg and Spiritfall, a pair of roguelites with different levels of charm, and has also been really enjoying his time with Atomfall.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> been playing Oblivion Remastered, “which is great despite an awful loot system and repetitive and hard to navigate caves/dungeons”, and made starts on Split Fiction with his sister, on Sea of Stars for yet more RPG-ing, and Chains of Freedom.</p>

<p>And who’s this? A wild <strong>Reuben</strong> has dragged himself out of his most intense studies to play some games for a bit. He’s been playing older titles while waiting for new ones, finishing FUGA again and about to make a start on FUGA 2, what with the third one coming along soon, and has been refusing to play with “modern controls” or visuals while working through Tomb Raider I-III Remastered.</p>
<p>In total agreement with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">our 10/10 review</a>, <strong>Steve</strong> has been having a fantastic time with Clair Obscur, so much so that he’s doing all the&nbsp;Gestral trials and unlocked all the swimsuits – “for research purposes, of course”. Besides that, he’s still grinding through Lego Star Wars, and enjoyed the throwback that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/captain-blood-review-original-pirate-material/">Captain Blood</a>.</p>

<p>And finally we come to <strong>Miguel</strong>, who had the special task of reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and enjoyed it, even if not quite as much as DOOM Eternal. He’s also been carrying on with&nbsp;Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

At least the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt and White Flare Pokémon Center preorders</a> avoided a hostile bot takeover this time around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most dramatic crash this week is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObXmY?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex 214/167</a>, crashing by nearly half when compared the the start of this year. We're also seeing some nice price drops across Obsidian Flames and the elusive 151 expansions.

But <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnxlX?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquazza VMAX Alt Art</a> is quite literally soaring high, scoring an extra $100 in value since the start of this year. Let's dig into all the rest of the biggest Pokémon TCG climbers and crashers of the week.</p><p id="card-crashes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Crashes">Pokémon Card Crashes</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t113825-747-1746803600091.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst we're finally seeing a noticeable climb in Sword and Shield era Pokémon Cards, Scarlet and Violet series cards are settling back down into the realm of reality for the most part. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7O2x7?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex SIR</a> from 151 is a georgous card, and it's 34% lower in price than the beggining of March. There's absolutley no reason for not having Uri Gellars Grandad claiming a spot in your binder this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bulbasaur was my first starter Pokémon when I first loaded up Pokémon Blue way back when, so this <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GkpE?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur IR</a> has a special place in my heart. This card has dropped by a massive 52% since mid-March, so there's no reason to not catch this beautiful card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving onto Obsidian Flames, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7O2x7?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninetales IR</a> has always been one of the best cards of the set. If you agree then it's time to snap this card up seeing as it's crashed by 40% from Feburary so a reasonable $18.17.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People can complain about Obsidian Flames all they want, but it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDqpr?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex SIR</a> so cool. Rocking a stained glass look in it's Tera form, it's a show stopper for sure. Granted it's not come down too much since March, but $5 less is $5 saved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally the biggest crasher this month is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObXmY?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex SIR</a>, which at one point was set to become the most expensive Scarlet and Violet era card. Then Prismatic Evolutions came along and took the FOMO up 10 notches. It's still a class card that's holding it's weight at $275, but imagine reading this and paying $411.62 at the end of Feburary. Oh dear.</p><p id="card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t161701-761-1746804035935.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving onto this weeks climbers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnxlX?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquazza VMAX alt art</a> is one of the main grails of the Sword and Shield era. It was already a $500+ card, but at $649.99 it shows no signs of slowing down. This could arguably hit the $1,000 mark in a few years, so i'd get one fi you can afford it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There can't be enough Kanto love in my book, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Krn?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard V Alt Art</a> smashes it out of the park with this Venusaur battle. The angle is great and it feels like a moving card instead of a static body shot so many Pokémon cards are guilty of (Looking at you, WotC era). It's earned another $40 since January, and there's no reason why this card can't get over $200 before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1EVR?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragonite V Alt Art</a> is one of the highlights of Evolving Skies. It's a fan favorite Pokémon that can look cute as hell or ready to rip another mon's face off. It's a full package that looks nothing like it's pre evolutions, but that's ok because it's Dragonite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's cute side comes out in this artwork, and that's exactly why it's nearly doubled in value since the middle of January. It's now rocking a solid $225, so make sure to grab yours before it flies any higher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-biggest-crashers-and-climbers-of-the-week-may-2">Did you catch last week's article</a>?

Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a wierd spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG full Release Schedule</a> so far for this year too so you don't miss anything.

It’s a term that’s been partially used in jest, partially to get around what some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0unckb-w2Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players say is Infold Games censoring the word</a> “boycott” on its official forums and community spaces. Players globally are vowing to stay off the game until Infold Games addresses their concerns, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVoabK9Fro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including at least one <em>Infinity Nikki</em></a> creator who is part of the game’s partner program.</p><p>What does it mean to girlcott? Of course, it means not logging into <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. And if you do, crucially, not spending money. Players are also attempting to warn other off of the game; the Chinese <em>Infinity Nikki </em>community – as well as others – has been flooding Steam with negative reviews of the game:.“Do not play this game if you do not want to be exploited,” one user, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198929196594/recommended/3164330/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who claims to be part of the Chinese boycott</a>, wrote on Steam. “Our voice should be heard.”&nbsp;</p><p>There are some people, too, who are attempting to get the message in-game, using in-game messaging to send jestful subliminal messaging: “aGaIn in staRLight, Crystal and gOld shine TogeTher,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1kgbekj/subtle_enough_to_not_get_banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one player wrote</a>.</p><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em>, the latest in a long running series that's been mobile-only for decades, released in December 2024. The game came to Steam in late April, alongside the unpopular “Bubble Season” update. The game launched on Steam to mixed reviews; the complaints are also impacting <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infoldgames.infinitynikkien&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review score on the Google Play Store</a>. (Reviews remain high, at 4 stars, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infinity-nikki/id6502622570?see-all=reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Apple iOS Store</a>; a lot of the problems are tied to the Steam release and attached 1.5 update, but impact all versions of the game.)</p><p>The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> development team quickly issued a response to players’ concerns at the end of April, with <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1917238176168677669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a spokesperson writing on X</a>, “We understand that every stylist’s love and trust in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is something we must cherish and uphold with the utmost dedication.” The company said it’s working to fix the patch’s performance issues, which have caused game-breaking bugs for some players.</p><p>The message also attempted to explain some of the development team’s more unpopular decisions. You see, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a gacha game, but instead of pulling characters to play as, you’re rolling for pieces of outfits. You have to spend currency to roll for these pieces, and while you <em>can</em> earn currency in-game, it’s not often enough, which means players end up spending real money to get more pulls. Most outfits range from nine to ten pieces of clothing, but the new update added two 11-piece outfits. To put it simply, it now costs more to collect the full outfit from the gacha system, especially given that players often look to collect outfits multiple times, to “evolve” the outfit. To make matters worse, Infold Games’ new customization system, which lets players dye outfits, requires <em>another</em>, newly-added currency.</p><p>The team didn’t address the use of a new currency, but did say they wanted to “provide stylists with greater freedom in outfit design.” In response, the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> team also gave players some free currency, but there’s been problems there, too: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1kgze93/all_of_us_after_they_started_penalizingbugged_our/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Players say Infold had a bug in this distribution</a>, which awarded players too much free currency. Instead of letting players keep that – it was Infold’s mistake, after all – they deducted the currency, some of which players had already spent, putting them in the negative.&nbsp;</p><p>But the community is looking for more from the studio; it wants an acknowledgement of the “dumpster fire” of a situation, as one <em>Infinity Nikki</em> player told Aftermath, but also wants some of the biggest problems reversed. The original statement simply isn’t enough for <em>Infinity Nikki</em> players; they don’t see it as true accountability for the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Infold Games has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>Despite being a gacha game, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> and its team has earned a lot of goodwill from its player base up until now — something that is, indeed, somewhat ironic, given the game's genre. <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a gacha game; a gacha game is not inherently bad, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1khdxdu/ethics_boycotts_gacha_and_infinity_nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but as Reddit user girlrevolution wrote</a>, the monetization system can be viewed as inherently predatory. <em>Infinity Nikki</em> has been considered by its players less predatory because the game <em>can</em> be played without spending a cent. The new update pushed the gacha system much too far for a lot of players — something made more egregious by the numerous bugs and strange gameplay changes.</p><p>Several players told Aftermath that they felt Infold listens to the community, even if the community didn’t always agree with Infold’s decisions. The earlier Nikki games, <em>Love Nikki</em> and <em>Shining Nikki</em>, earned the developer a reputation for beautiful clothing and complex, sometimes wacky storytelling. “I’ve been around for a while,” Daisy, who’s been playing <em>Nikki</em> games for nearly a decade, told Aftermath. “I’ve put up with a lot of Infold’s crap when it came to the prices in their games.”</p><p>Another <em>Infinity Nikki</em> player, who asked to have her name withheld, told Aftermath that the new update pushed the monetization structure over the edge. She said <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s gacha systems wouldn’t be <em>that</em> bad compared to other gacha games, if <em>Infinity Nikki</em> only had one “monetization scheme.” Instead, everything seems to cost <em>something</em>, so the added currency for dying outfits felt particularly bad. “[It’s] particularly egregious because it’s painfully obvious that dyes were originally supposed to be tied to resources you could collect in game,” she said. “Someone craved short term profit so much that they decided to just dump that in the trash.”</p><p>Daisy said it would take up to $300 to $400 to earn all the color options of a single 5-star outfit in <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. Regarding the new 11-piece outfits, Daisy believes the new items are simply a money grab. “The dresses on these banners are floor length, so the stockings added were unnecessary, and one of the dresses was shown, in earlier cutscenes, to not have stockings,” she said. “To me, they artificially inflated the suits so players would spend more money.”</p><p>Beyond the problematic monetization strategy, players Aftermath spoke with said they’re also pissed off at a major change to the start of the game. The original story set up Nikki’s transportation into Miraland as an accident that happened as she searched for a dress for a ball; the dress she found tucked away in the attic ended up sending her into the new world. But Infold Games removed the game’s original start with the update; the new intro drops players into <em>Infinity Nikki</em> with little context and a new, unexplained character who is supposed to be a guide as Nikki is dropped into intergalactic limbo.&nbsp;</p><p>Some players think this is a total retconning of the story they’ve come to consider <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s lore. And it’s wildly confusing.&nbsp; Daisy said, “It’s honestly really, really confusing, and I have almost ten years of <em>Nikki</em> story in the recesses of my mind.”</p><p>Another <em>Infinity Nikki</em> player, Dia, put it this way: “It just feels like Infold has destroyed whatever was enjoyable about the game, story and characters; broke every promise to deliver enjoyable experience in the future; forced to release a very broken patch that is almost unplayable to a lot of people; and all of that was done just to focus on asking more money for time-limited gacha.”</p><p>The big problem for a lot of players isn't simply that they don't want to spend money on <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. The community at large isn't upset that <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a gacha game; they're upset that the trust they've given Infold Games thus far has been broken.</p><p>"I put money in this game because I liked the product and felt that I could support them from an ethical standpoint, but that is no longer the case," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1khdxdu/ethics_boycotts_gacha_and_infinity_nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">girlrevolution wrote</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike"><h3>Healers In Marvel Rivals Went On Strike</h3></a><p>Thank your support players once in a while, folks</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other disciplines were also involved. UI artist Sadie Boyd became part of the push immediately after joining Blizzard last September, just as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another round of layoffs</a></span> was sweeping through Microsoft. She said someone posted a link to sign a union card in one of the Blizzard Slack channels, which she did immediately. After all, she’d already been part of a union drive at <em>Prey </em>and <em>Redfall </em>maker Arkane Austin before it had been shut down by Microsoft earlier in the year. </p><p>“We’re not just a number on an Excel sheet,” Boyd said. “We want to make games but we can’t do it without a sense of security.” Unionizing doesn’t make a studio immune to layoffs or being shuttered, but it’s the first step toward making companies have a discussion about those things with employees rather than just shadow-dropping them in an email full of platitudes. Boyd sees the <em>Overwatch</em> union as a tool for negotiating a range of issues, like if and how generative AI is used at Blizzard, as well as a possible source of inspiration to teams at other studios. </p><p>“Our industry is at such a turning point,” she said. “I really think with the announcement of our union on <em>Overwatch</em>...I know that will light some fires.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>DOOM, a series likely thought dead during its twelve-year hiatus (not including re-releases) between DOOM 3 and 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM reboot</a>, is on a high. The success of DOOM, followed by the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM Eternal</a>, means it was inevitable that a new release would come. What I didn't expect was the direction of that, which is where DOOM: The Dark Ages comes in.</p>
<p>By abandoning multiplayer and opting for a pure single-player and narrative-focused experience, DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the series somewhere different and a little medieval.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. It focuses on an earlier incursion of hell and explains why the Doom Slayer is who he is. Long story short, the Makyrs essentially had him tethered as their slave-weapon, keeping him trapped unless they needed him, just pointing him towards the demons they wanted killed. The series has never really been narrative-heavy, and I'm not going to pretend that it somehow is now, but I do like what they've done here.</p>
<p>Despite his general lack of depth, the Doom Slayer is a surprisingly good character. In the previous games, you could understand perfectly what he was thinking in every circumstance, and that thought is essentially "Kill demons, F- everything else". While he's already in this frame of mind, you will get to see more of his time while under the control of the Makyr, during the invasion of Argent D'nur. You will also meet far more characters than in any other title in the series (that I remember). Where the lore in previous games was relegated to reading the codex entries, here you get it through cutscenes and other monologues. The Doom Slayer is still as vocal as always.</p>
<p>I won't cover more of the story to avoid spoilers, but I've enjoyed the change in direction. This is despite my saying in my DOOM Eternal review that I don't care about the story in a DOOM game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Let's be brutally honest: most people don't come into a DOOM game because of its narrative, including DOOM: The Dark Ages. Having it, and a good one, is just the icing on the extremely bloody and demonic cake. No, people come for the gameplay, the gory fun stuff, and I would argue that it's fun. Clearing what may be a sticking point for some people, I don't care about the lack of a multiplayer mode. Most people know me enough that a multiplayer mode is usually a negative, not a positive.</p>
<p>Rather than including multiplayer, DOOM: The Dark Ages includes the longest campaign in the series. Across 22 different stages, each offering a good level of variety, you will be doing everything from the regular run-and-gun DOOM action, to hopping in an Atlan - a giant humanoid war machine - or even riding a dragon into battle. Add a host of weapons, some returning, others new (including a flail, to stick to the medieval-style theme), and you have exciting demon-murdering gameplay, still joined by melee finishing moves to replenish your health and ammo. As a note, the traditional glory kills are gone unless it's a boss, which some may be disappointed with.</p>
<p>The actual run-and-gun gameplay feels more grounded than in DOOM Eternal, closer to that of DOOM (2016). This isn't to say there isn't any verticality, there is, but it no longer feels like it has delusions of being a secret-platformer. There likely isn't anything here that you won't find familiar if you've played the first game. Every weapon and ability has its use; each can be upgraded with the various currencies and items found throughout the game.</p>
<p>Much like the previous titles, the weapons are well placed within the game, meaning when you need one, it'll be introduced, with a quick tutorial. I recommend reading these because you may miss some of the bonuses weapons can bring. For example, one of the earliest ones can overcharge the energy shields of enemies, causing them to explode. Knowing the additional effects and upgrading the weapons to give them new abilities can be extremely useful in your quest to kill everything that breathes, has ever breathed, and will ever breathe.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Despite my praise of returning to a more horizontal gameplay, I have a few criticisms. Okay, one. I don't like the dragon and anything to do with it. It's cool, but when I'm flying a dragon, it should not be locked into a near horizontal plane once I'm locked onto an enemy. I'm flying a dragon with guns. I want to be able to swoop in and shoot, and I want to do strafing runs. It looks and comes across like it should be aerial combat, but the actual combat feels nothing like that.</p>
<p>This isn't to say it doesn't fit in with the world or narrative, but there is a disconnect between what it is and how it feels like it should be. Particularly when flying outside of combat, which is free-flowing. My thoughts on this don't extend to other things, such as the Atlan, which does fit in well with the rest of the game. It feels slower paced, as expected from a giant mech, but it doesn't feel like it should be something else. Granted, I can imagine some people being frustrated by the slower pace compared to the core gameplay.</p>
<p>Still, these are minor issues in the grand scheme. It's a long campaign packed with DOOM goodness, including finding secrets, codex entries, and more. Exploration is, as always, rewarded. It also does exceptionally well opening up the game on some levels, giving you a vast map to play in and tackle objectives in the way you want. Eschewing the linearity gives it a fresher feel at times, and it's also handy to turn back around and replenish some stocks if you've found that you're struggling in a fight.</p>
<p>It's all tied together with excellent visuals and audio. Now, this being a DOOM game, and it being 2025, that's like saying "the sun will rise in the morning". I still can't emphasise enough that the aesthetics and design of DOOM: The Dark Age are excellent, particularly when you start venturing away from Argent. Add the usual metal riff to this, and you've got a successful, pulse-pounding action and blood-filled game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So, to put it all quite simply, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a good game—no, it's a very good game. I would recommend it to fans of the genre and people who want to have fun without the risk of anything transmissible via bodily fluids. Unless we're talking about demon blood and guts, there's lots of that. DOOM: The Dark Ages is yet another success from Id Software, and long may they continue.</p>

						<section>
				<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</p>

							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Outstanding run &amp; gun DOOM gameplay.

The tastiest thing you can currently do in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haneda-girl">Haneda Girl</a> is eject yourself from your mech straight into a streaking katana blow that carries you though a door and two torsos before teleport-summoning your mech as though inflating a lifejacket to gun down three other mooks in a giddy gout of purple gore. OK, that’s more than one thing. It is, according to local experts, a combo. What are combos good for? Score multipliers, that’s what. Here is a trailer. Ware the techno.

In this action-platform stealth me-do from Studio Koba, you’re a juvenile coin-op junkie who has been piped Tron-style into an arcade game to “save Data Empire from the frightening (and intense) Hackernauts.” Each level is a tidy 2D breach-and-clear puzzlebox in which you can stomp around in your M.O.T.H.E.R mecha, or platform on foot like a sucker. While inside the mecha you have Gatling guns and shields, but you’re too hefty to fit through doors. While on foot, meanwhile, you can run up walls and backstab people, but you can also be slain in one hit. 
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Haneda Girl can teleport-summon the mecha without penalty, so there’s no need to commit to either style, save for when you’re constrained by an obstacle such as an inconsiderately human-sized passage or a katana-proof fractured surface. The Steam blurb has some helpful, slightly insulting advice: “I am fearful and conservative = use M.O.T.H.E.R”; “Some days I get the nerve = Swap between M.O.T.H.E.R and Haneda”; “I am very forward = Haneda Girl (no doubts)”. 
</p>
<p>
To put all that another way, you will “move like in Celeste”, “destroy like in Bro Force”, “slash like in Katana Zero”, and “die like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>”. Woah, save some touchstones for the rest of us, Studio Koba! There’s wearing your influences on your sleeve, and then there’s bulletpointing them as verbs. 
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, Haneda Girl has a few fresh ideas of its own. The dual character setup harbours a nifty symbiotic resourcing element. When Haneda Girl ejects from the cockpit, the mecha’s shields are restored; when she summons the mecha, it also replenishes her superdash attacks. So the more you switch, the more capable you’ll be, and the more you’ll feel like weaving the mech and pilot elements into a gratifying techno pretzel.</p>
<p>Given some appropriately devious level design, I think these fundamentals could really sing. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169790/Haneda_Girl/">a demo on Steam</a>. The full game releases on 23rd May.

Some examples include tweaking "voiced dialogue" to "vocal material" to include monster/creature sounds or efforts and cover said performances, as well as pursuing clarity on how companies will keep track of performances to pay workers when they use them at a later date.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This includes the Secondary Performance Payment (SSP)—a one-time payment meant to help protect performance-capture acting performers from being fully displaced by generative AI. The union said it‛s willing to give on the amount of payment, allowing for an annual audit, making said payment optional rather than mandatory. It also rejected the 12-month limit on reporting about the use of an actor‛s performance "because games take much longer than 12 months," as per the response, and workers might need information that goes farther back than said period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employers originally wanted to provide AI protections solely to new performances under the interactive media agreement (IMA). In short, anything done previously, as well as performances taken from outside the IMA would be given no protections.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Nintendo</a> doesn't respond to every rumor and bit of speculation on the internet, but it has stepped up to push back against speculation that AI-generated images were used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Some viewers of Nintendo's last Treehouse presentation for the kart racer suspected that AI-generated images were used in Mario Kart World on the billboards that fill part of the background on the tracks. Specifically, they thought artwork of a bridge and one immediately next to it of a skyscraper being built were AI-generated. A third billboard featuring a car with exaggerated windows was also thought to be AI-generated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – Grand Prix Gameplay – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWjkbAQOGY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">Eurogamer</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson bluntly shut down the suspicions that AI-generated content was used in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"<em>AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World</em>," they said.</p>
<p>The images in question might look wonky to players now, but it's worth noting that Nintendo is likely updating and polishing details like these background billboards as much as possible, leading up to the release of the game and the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p>
<p>These billboards could have even been placeholders at the time of the Treehouse presentation that will be swapped with entirely different images for the game's launch, or simply not final versions of the artwork that will feature in the final release. Ultimately, at this stage in the game, we can't determine if these images were AI-generated. It'll be interesting to see if they make it into the final release, and if they remain the same, are updated and polished up, or are changed entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest explanation here could also be the truth, that these images simply aren't up to snuff, and that these background billboards perhaps aren't where Nintendo's artists have done their best work. People make mistakes all the time, and this could very well be as simple as that.</p>

Developer Silent Games’ <em>Empyreal</em> is among the newest attempts to capture the all-important thrill of challenging combat and dangerous exploration, casting players as a mercenary exploring a colossal Monolith on an unexplored planet. If you’re itching to check it out, you may be curious how much time you’ll need to complete it, though. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196742,196452" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h852"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Empyreal</em>?</h2><p>As is common with Soulslike games, <em>Empyreal</em> offers a difficult expedition that requires careful positioning, intense strategy, and quick reflexes to overcome its many powerful foes. But with a bit of practice and patience, overcoming its trials is certainly doable—though how long that takes will largely depend on your skill level.</p><p><strong>An average playthrough of <em>Empyreal</em> will take around 15-20 hours</strong>, which includes exploring for secrets, completing NPC side-quests, and tackling the game’s punishing boss encounters. However, the first playthrough is just the beginning of your adventure through the Monolith.</p><p><strong>After beating <em>Empyreal</em> the first time, you can begin a New Game Plus run</strong> for some fresh experiences. These include an increased level cap for Cartograms, additional NPC duels, and even an epilogue to reward those who want to absorb the game’s full story. Running through the game this second time means you can essentially double your playtime in this Soulslike journey.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that <em>Empyreal</em> features asynchronous multiplayer, which allows you to share items and more to assist other players in their instance of the game. If you’re the type who lives by the “sharing is caring” mantra, this should give you a reason to stick around and make yourself useful. If not, maybe therapy would be a more rewarding way to spend your money than grabbing a copy of <em>Empyreal</em>, you big meanie.</p><hr><p><em>Empyreal</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Freddy Fazbear and his animatronic-filled pizza emporium headline Behviour’s plans for this year’s anniversary chapter, which is expected to arrive in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lillard, who starred as William Afton in 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy’s movie</a> adaptation, has embodied the spirit of the role once again to lend his likeness and record new voice lines for Dead by Daylight’s latest Killer: Springtrap. This evil animatronic bunny, otherwise known as Yellow Rabbit or Spring Bonnie, will be available as a Legendary Outfit when the collection eventually arrives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behaviour calls Five Nights at Freddy’s the “most requested license in Dead by Daylight history,” so fans should be excited to hear that the content drop will also include a Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza map that is said to be filled with a buffet of Easter Eggs and surprises to uncover. More news, including a specific release date, is expected to arrive in the near future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/dbd-fnaf-key-art-1746758440373.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/dbd-fnaf-map-exterior-screenshot-1746758445776.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Five Nights at Freddy's comes to Dead by Daylight.

Also revealed at PAX East was the news that CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher series is also set to make an appearance in Behviour’s hit horror experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set will make its mark as a special Witcher Collection June 3 and includes outfits inspired by the popular fantasy RPG universe. This includes a Legendary piece inspired by the White Wolf himself, Geralt of Rivia, as well as Very Rare outfits for Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. As an added bonus, those who pick up the Geralt costume will notice that original voice actor Doug Cockle contributed new voice lines just for this very occasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our favorite of the Collection is, of course, Geralt’s Legendary Outfit for Vittorio Toscano,” Dead by Daylight Product Director Rose Li said in a statement. “Not only will it let players essentially take on the exact look of The White Wolf, but we’ve also added some really nice details as part of this Outfit. Geralt will have unique lobby animations, and best of all, brand-new voice lines recorded for our game by the original voice actor, Doug Cockle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragula, Shudder’s monster-themed drag reality competition series, is also doubling down on its relationship with Dead by Daylight.

June highlights include a The Archives revamp and adjusted Gamma Settings, with the months ahead set to bring updates that add more spectators in Custom Matches, map and key item rebalancing, an MMR rework, and more balance tweaks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Director Dave Richard also teased something completely new: a Dead by Daylight Chapter entirely created by fans. It’s a move that will see Behaviour working with its community to create a Killer and Survivor from the ground up in what sounds like a choose-your-own-adventure-style narrative, meaning everything about each character will be voted on by the players. It’s due out in 2026, so we’ll have to wait a while to learn more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead by Daylight launched in 2016 and has only grown since.

                <p><strong>Update</strong>: As of 11:15 AM PT / 2:15 PM ET, this issue appears to be resolved--and just in time for Mace Windu to hit the shop tonight.</p><p><strong>Original story</strong>: The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> item shop has ballooned in recent years. In 2018 or so, you might find a new character skin, or "outfit," in there a few times per week. These days, it's a megastore full of licensed music, muscle cars, virtual Lego playsets, Marvel heroes, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-in-the-fortnite-item-shop-today-november-2-2021-el-chapulin-colorado-arrives/1100-6497610/" data-ref-id="1100-6497610">the protagonist of a 1970s Mexican superhero sitcom</a>, for reasons that still elude me to this day. But today the shop looks very different: It's almost entirely empty.</p><p>As you might expect, this isn't intentional, and Epic has said it's working on a fix, but it's rather jarring to see the shop so devoid of in-game purchases, given how many tabs of colorful digital toys it's usually lined with these days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1920888048914514198" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're investigating an issue where the in-game Shop and Web Item Shop may appear empty.<br>We'll provide an update once this is resolved. <a href="https://t.co/cLlcJrdEB2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/cLlcJrdEB2</a></p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1920888048914514198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The only things for sale currently are the few items purchased with local currency rather than V-Bucks, as well as the level skips for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-star-wars-battle-pass-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-6523/" data-ref-id="2900-6523">Fortnite Star Wars battle pass</a>. This includes things like a Fortnite Crew subscription, and "starter packs" that tend to include a few bundled items for cheap. Everything else has vanished like your total crowns on a season launch day.</p><p>It's unclear what has caused this error, but it may be related to Epic's continued woes surrounding the item shop. Since its user experience overhaul, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-item-shop-wont-stop-being-weird/1100-6520635/" data-ref-id="1100-6520635">the Fortnite virtual store has routinely expressed some confusing, often slightly comical, problems</a>. Then again, perhaps today's issue comes as the result of some advantageous changes to the Epic Games Store, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-makes-buying-v-bucks-a-lot-more-rewarding/1100-6531431/" data-ref-id="1100-6531431">which will now see players getting back 20% of their money spent V-Bucks purchases through Epic directly</a>, as the company gears up to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">Fortnite back on iOS</a> around the globe.</p><p>Whatever the cause of today's slip-up, it's likely to be resolved soon, so don't fret; the TikTok dances, anthropomorphic fruit, and Rocket League imports will return.</p>

<p>"Rest assured, Guardians, everything in Renegades is in-canon for the Destiny universe," he said. "But we're leaning into the aesthetic, tone and vibe of Star Wars to tell a Destiny story with Destiny characters."</p><p>Two other changes incoming are how Power levels work and Vault space expanding as well. During the stream, Bungie showed some items with a 10 power and confused some players. Not a lot of detail was shared, but the company confirmed that players will have their Power level changed at the start of the Year of Prophecy.</p><p>"We'll have more details on Power caps and climbs in a future TWID, but can confirm that Power will be rebased at launch! All players will have their Power refreshed as we embark on this new journey."</p><p>As for your items being limited to your Vault space, that won't be changing in The Edge of Fate, but players will have additional Vault space and even "quality of life" features planned for Renegades later this year. </p><p>Another one of the biggest core game changes coming to Destiny 2 will be the Portal, a new activity selection screen built to accommodate different playstyles to make it easier on where players want to go next. For years, players have relied on the Director for their activity browsing. However, over the years, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-may-have-fixed-destiny-2s-most-frustrating-problem/1100-6531356/" data-ref-id="1100-6531356">become muddled and a bit confusing</a>. What's proposed with Portal (name pending) is to clean up the screen to make it easier to get to the current expansion or event content. The Director will still be around and will be under the Worlds tab in the Portal.</p><p>The Edge of Fate preorders are now available on all supported platforms, and there are <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy/yearofprophecy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three different versions</a>. Additionally, the Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy Collector's Edition is also available for preorder on the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy/YearOfProphecy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Store</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive has announced that an updated version of the Gothic Remake demo is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The demo wasn't very well-received when it first became available during February's Steam Next Fest, but the developers have improved it based on the community's feedback. For example, Alkimia was originally inspired by the slow movement of a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, but players communicated that they'd prefer something more reactive.</p>
<p><em>We see a lot of things we didn't have so much on the radar, for example, like the movement in the game. Our main reference really was Red Dead Redemption 2, which is a game that has a very slow pacing in terms of movement. The clear feedback, though, was people like it more reactive, and that certain actions that are repeated over and over again should be rather quick, which means not realistic.</em></p>
<p><em>In the Demo specifically, there were certain elements that were not working out. The Demo is just what it is. It's not representative of the full Gothic Remake game. The Demo is locked at a certain time of day, so you obviously have just no visual variety. There’s no weather in there — it’s always sunny, right? You see one specific weather and daylight condition all the time. It's not doing justice to the full game.</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody has to realize also that, of course, the Gothic Remake demo has daily routines, but they are nowhere near as detailed as in the original. And of course it has some monsters, but like, of course you won't see how monsters beyond that react. You only see very few characters, and you don't see them in a camp, where they are actually living, where they have a real daily routine.</em></p>
<p><em>They are kind of like all in an extreme situation because they are trapped. You should get an idea of what can happen with progression, but it was maybe a little too fast. So players might get the wrong idea of like, oh, in the Gothic Remake you will actually progress faster than you will do. But no, the pacing is still very much the same, the power curve.</em></p>
<p><em>And then another big problem of the combat in the demo was the hit sounds. There were just clear bugs in there. Sometimes, you would think you'd land a hit with the sword, because the models touch each other, but it wouldn't recognize the hit, so it gives you this awkward feeling of like, oh, the combat system is bad.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's a glitch, it's a bug. It's something we'll address and fix. We're&nbsp;not saying like, hey, all is good, right? There's a lot of stuff we need to improve, much, much further and continue to work on until the very end.</em></p>

Sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> is the first game from Reburn, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">a new incarnation of Metro co-developers 4A Games Ukraine</a>. It's out now in early access. That last bit is a surprise: the developers had planned to release the new shooter as "a large, complete journey", but had to make "certain pivots" in the face of resource constraints, technical complications and, presumably, the broad impacts of living in a warzone. This led to a launch delay last week and then, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2282350/view/512957012199342081?l=english">the abrupt announcement</a> that La Quimera would start out as an early access project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I've played the first of the early access build's four missions, and yeah, it all feels a bit undercooked, though I feel like the problem is less execution than concept. La Quimera simply doesn't feel like a very enthralling shooter, next to the developer's previous post-apocalyptic Moscow tunnel escapades.</p>
<p>It's set in a futuristic travesty of Latin America that is sort of Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare trying to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> by way of Horizon: Zero Dawn, with neo-Aztec megacities and verdant metal ruins full of feral bots. You play a PMC trooper who embarks on a straightforward rescue mission and is promptly swept up in wider technofeudal shenanigans, which usefully lead to you becoming a guinea pig for some cybernetic implants. 
</p>

<p>
Said early-game Stroggification brings with it a suite of secondary abilities and upgrades, which I've yet to acquire. They'll need to be exciting indeed, because La Quimera's gunplay is currently rather plodding for what is theoretically more of a power fantasy than Metro. In brief: you hide behind things and pick 'em off one by one till somebody flanks or lobs a grenade - rinse and repeat. There are two broad categories of gun: red types are for dudes, blue types are for drones. The weapons are tricked out and greebled to the max - one of the starting pistols looks like a ghost-busting hairdryer - but they don't (yet) have the storied intimacy of Metro's hydraulic BB guns and drum-fed shotties. They're just flashy gizmos. 
</p>
<p>
You can say similar things of the story and world. The setting is touristy bordering on demeaning - this is one of those localisations where people tactically pepper the English with bits of high-velocity Spanish, as though the other language existed to supply punchlines. The dialogue is also sweary in a way that is <em>almost</em> overcompensatory enough to be charming, like you're witnessing kids utter their very first F-bombs, but mostly just insipid. Still, a lot of thought appears to have gone into the dense and gleaming or gutted and overgrown architecture and geography. It's just a shame La Quimera won't let you explore too far: this appears to be a universe of tunnels and tiered chambers, like Metro, except that being set in the open air, it needs holographic red mission boundaries to stop you wandering off. 
</p>

<p>
It doesn't feel like a particularly tough game on Normal difficulty. Health must be replenished manually, but the game restores a little out of mercy when you're nearly dead, and there are regular checkpoints to soften the fall when you exhaust your capped supply of medikits. You also have the option of co-op, with players forming up in your hub base before embarking on missions.
</p>
<p>
La Quimera will remain in early access for "up to 18 months". Here's what you'll hopefully get in the full release:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes.
</p>
<p>
- Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations.
</p>
<p>
- Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters.
</p>
<p>
- Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players.
</p>
<p>
- A larger number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I would definitely reserve your pennies for the moment. I can sort of see a serviceable shooter arising from this one's whirl of doodads, bandidos and cussing. Perhaps the later plot developments and fancier upgrades will save it from disaster. Still, if you're after a campaign shooter right now, you're probably better off digging out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> again.

                <p>With Fortnite and other Epic mobile titles finally returning to iOS soon after five years, Epic Games is marking the occasion by introducing a major bonus for those who spend money on its games: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/better-deals-in-fortnite-and-more-players-get-20-back-in-epic-rewards-starting-today" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20% back in rewards cash</a> on all purchases in Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys made using Epic's own payment system in the Epic Games Store, a massive boost from the 5% it normally offers. Even better is that this change is permanent, and is already live.</p><p>But that's not all--that 20% cash back will apply to <em>all</em> purchases made through EGS until the end of August. If that percentage seems extraordinarily high, that's because it is. Under these terms, buying a new $70 game will net $14 in credit that you can use on anything in the Epic Games Store aside from subscriptions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243" data-ratio="0.56239217941346" data-width="1739" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243"></a><figcaption>The new option that will be presented to Fortnite players when they purchase V-Bucks on iPhone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Epic's motivation for this move is to encourage players to spend money with them directly rather than going through, say, Apple's App Store, which takes its own healthy percentage from every purchase made. For Fortnite specifically, Apple would take 30% off every purchase of V-Bucks--offering 20% back in rewards, by contrast, gives Epic the full purchase amount aside from normal transaction fees, and since the rewards cash can only be spent on the Epic Games Store it hypothetically keeps players invested in the company's ecosystem.</p><p>When players on iOS attempt to purchase V-Bucks now, they're given the option of doing so through the App Store or by using Epic's own payment systems, with the Epic option showing how much you'd earn in rewards. The Epic Rewards credit is applied to your account two weeks after the relevant purchase has been made, and once you've got it you can spend it on anything other than subscriptions. Meaning you can earn this 20% cash back by subscribing to Fortnite Crew, but you cannot use the store credit to pay for a Crew subscription.</p><p>This option is only for people who use Fortnite on PC, mobile or streaming--folks on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch will not have the option to pay Epic directly when they buy V-Bucks on those platforms. But console players can still use the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite web shop</a> and earn the 20% cash back that way.</p><p>It's a convenient moment for this change for a lot of Fortnite fans, as Mace Windu will be arriving in the Fortnite item shop this evening--the first new Star Wars item shop skin released during the current Star Wars season.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 | Animated Collaboration Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The crossover will begin on May 20 with a total of eight character skins, significantly more than recent collabs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2s-gundam-wing-collab-was-informed-by-gunpla/1100-6531147/" data-ref-id="1100-6531147">Gundam Wing</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-debuts-avatar-collaboration-costumes-and-a-free-skin/1100-6528431/" data-ref-id="1100-6528431">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>. Below is the full list of Overwatch characters who will be getting the Street Fighter treatment.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kirkio as Juri</li><li dir="ltr">Widowmaker as Cammy</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M.

Bison and Zenyatta as Dhalsim are no-brainers, and Hanzo being Japanese is a great fit for Ryu.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not released exact details on pricing or what freebies players will be able to score as part of the event, but the end of the trailer does show Hanzo performing a Hadoken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/09/toby-fox-is-releasing-deltarune-chapters-1-4-slightly-earlier-than-expected<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After years of waiting for news, we learned last month that Deltarune Chapters 1-4 would not only be coming out on June 5 but that it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">would be a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title</a>. However, in a newsletter sent out last night, developer/composer Toby Fox explained that the game itself will launch a little earlier than the console, depending on where you live.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for purchase in Japan starting at midnight on June 5, and since Deltarune will be a launch title, the game will also go live digitally at that time. However, Deltarune is not a console exclusive – it's also launching on PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC – so tying its international release to the staggered launch of just one of its platforms doesn't make sense. Instead, the game will go live worldwide at midnight JST.</p><p>Since Japan's time zone is ahead of most of the world, Deltarune will launch on June 4 in most areas. In the US, that becomes 8 AM Pacific and 11 AM Eastern, while Europe can expect to play the game in the early evening, and Asia can expect it later that night. The exceptions to this are parts of Australia, New Zealand, and other territories east of Japan. Because their midnight will come even earlier than Japan's, meaning the Switch 2 launch happens earliest there, they'll get access to Deltarune a few hours before the rest of the world's simultaneous release.</p>

<p>On the subject of Australia and New Zealand, Fox's newsletter urges them not to spoil the game. "But, for convenience's sake, we're just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out…" the newsletter says. "Meanwhile, don't say anything about it please."</p><p>The newsletter also announced cross-generation purchasing, which applies if you buy the game on a Nintendo or PlayStation platform. For example, if you buy a PlayStation 4 version of the game, you also get a PlayStation 5 version, which is pretty standard on the platform. However, the same will go for Nintendo: if you buy the game on the Switch, you can get the Switch 2 version at no additional cost. Whether you're unsure what time your Switch 2 will arrive on launch day or you didn't get one yet, you can buy the Switch 1 version and have the upgrade ready when you get the new platform. A prior newsletter also confirmed that you can transfer save data between the two versions.</p><p>Deltarune is Toby Fox's follow-up to Undertale, one of the most successful indie games of all time. If you're interested in playing the first two chapters, they're available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC for free. The complete game, which will include four chapters and free updates for any subsequent chapters, will be $24.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/07/ex-bungie-developers-create-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>A team of developers formerly employed by Bungie has negotiated a deal to spin-off from its original company and form its own, known now as teamLFG. The news was announced in a </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"><span><span><span><span>PlayStation Blog post</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, where PlayStation CEO Herman Hulst says, "teamLFG originated at Bungie, but has also rallied developers from across the industry." The team is working on an "ambitious incubation project," though it gave few concrete details outside of that.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>While employees of the new developer </span></span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%22106699404%22%5D&amp;origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;sid=KGq"><span><span><span><span>are listed publicly on LinkedIn</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, the announcement did not name anyone as founder or CEO, instead providing a statement from the studio as a whole. After stating its studio would be based in Bellevue, Washington, the statement explains that the "LFG" in the studio's name stands for "looking for group," a common internet acronym for people searching for people to play games with.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>TeamLFG's first game will include a wide range of inspirations, including one odd one. The statement reads, "Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games." Not only does this list not include shooters, the genre Bungie is best known for, but it also includes "frog-type games," a genre none of the staff at Game Informer is familiar with. If the studio's goal was to pique our curiosity, it succeeded.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sega has been making a concerted push into the multimedia space in recent years. The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>theatrical&nbsp;trilogy has led the charge since 2020, but just last year, we also received the Amazon MGM Studios-produced streaming series&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>on Prime Video. On top of that, Sega has announced adaptations based on Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and other franchises in the future. The company isn't stopping there, however, as a new report attaches actress Sydney Sweeney and director Michael Bay to an upcoming adaptation of the arcade driving series OutRun.</p>

<p>This report, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">comes from <em>Deadline</em></a>, attaches Sweeney as producer, Bay as director, and Jayson Rothwell as scriptwriter. Additionally, Sega senior executive officer Toru Nakahara will produce from Sega's side, while Sega President and Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi will oversee the project. Nakahara has produced every project in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>film series, including the Paramount Plus&nbsp;<em>Knuckles</em>&nbsp;show. He is also lined up to produce the Streets of Rage movie. Utsumi has served as executive producer on <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Knuckles,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.</p>

<p>Sweeney is best known for her roles in shows like&nbsp;<em>Euphoria</em>, <em>White Lotus</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, as well as films like&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.&nbsp;</em>Though best known for her onscreen work, according to <em>Deadline</em>'s report, Sweeney is only attached as a producer at this point. Bay is known as a longtime director of action films, including&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys, Armageddon</em>, five&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>&nbsp;films, and&nbsp;<em>Pearl Harbor</em>. Rothwell wrote for&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arachnid</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The film is being developed by Universal Pictures, though plot details are scarce at the moment, according to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>. You may note that Universal Pictures is also the studio behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which is the studio's third highest-grossing film of all time, behind only&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Furious 7.&nbsp;</em>While OutRun hardly has the name recognition of Super Mario Bros., it stands to reason that Universal would want to return to the video-game-adaptation well that brought them success with both <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i>&nbsp;and <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>.&nbsp;</p>
