			<p>Yesterday,<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/"> NetEase Games</a> and Marvel Games announced that Psylocke had joined the extensive roster for Marvel Rivals, the new Super Hero Team-Based PVP Shooter. This title is expected to be released on December 6, 2024, and already has an extensive roster offering a character for everyone. Psylocke will be joining the roster on the first day of launch, with all of the heroes being unlocked and free-to-play on the day of launch and continuing to remain that way throughout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Psylocke: Mutant Yokai Slayer | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzGcJm15XgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Psylocke will have access to a massive range of psychic abilities, which will allow her to outsmart her enemies, especially since she is incredibly agile and can dash across short distances. In addition, she can cloak herself and become invisible before attacking, making her the perfect assassin in battle. Psylocke's ultimate will combine all of those elements and allow her to rush across the battlefield with her wings out and cut down any enemies that dare get in her way.</p>
<p>Psylocke, also known as Sai, Is a wandering ronin in feudal Japan who has dedicated her time and skills to killing ancient demons and monsters. Accompanying her is her wolf, Logan. Psylocke has dedicated herself to not resting until all of the Yokai have fallen. However, Sai was taken from her version of reality by the Timestream Entanglement and was then put on display by the Collector. With the help of her new allies, she was able to escape her cage. Instead of killing Yokai, her new quest is to gather up all of the heroes she can find, end the conflict, and find a way to return home.</p>
<p>The version of Psylocke that will be appearing in Marvel Rivals is inspired by the character design from the comic Demon Days: X-Men, written by award-winning comic book artist Peach Momoko, who has received multiple rewards for their work. To honor the work, Psylocke was created alongside Marvel Rival artists and Momoko, to make it as authentic as possible. Psylocke will be voiced by Alpha Takahashi, who has voiced characters in Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, and Black Desert Online, for example.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not stated what role she will fall into, as there are three distinct roles that players can choose from in Marvel Rivals. This includes Vanguard, Duelist, and Strategist.</p>
<p>Currently, those interested in the game can sign up for <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming beta tests</a> for a chance to experience Marvel Rivals before the game fully releases on December 6, 2024.</p>

The game follows Princess Zelda as she is given the chance to be the hero for once, after mysterious rifts appear across Hyrule and swallow up people (including Link) with no explanation. Zelda, with the aid of the new Tri Rod, sets out on her own journey to rescue the kingdom through a series of puzzle solving and combat. The core mechanic of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> are the echoes: creatures and objects in the world you can summon at will to navigate obstacles.</p><p>At the time of writing, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> has an 86 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Metacritic</a></span>.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>’s Tom Marks, praised the title as much more than a second-tier spinoff thanks to how it combines “the expertly crafted dungeons and item progression you’d expect from a 2D <em>Zelda </em>with the wild creativity provided by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-roundup-metacritic-1850427714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-roundup-metacritic-1850427714"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>.”</p><p>There are some recurring criticisms that pop up in a few reviews, namely a lack of puzzle variety as the game goes on. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>’s Ash Parrish wrote, “There are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far. And in nearly every instance, those challenges can be solved with the same handful of echoes.”</p><p>Still, overall the game seems to be a worthwhile entry in the legendary series, even if some of its better ideas aren’t fully realized. One thing critics agree on is that Zelda should get many more chances to be the hero.</p><p>Here’s a round up of what others are saying about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>:</p><h2 id="h6933"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>IGN</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D <em>Zelda </em>with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before<em> Breath of the Wild</em> without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of <em>Zelda</em>, I can’t wait to see more.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6934"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>VGC</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The potential for a special <em>Zelda </em>adventure is present in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s ideas, but uneven execution means it’s neither as mechanically refreshing and satisfying as<em> A Link Between Worlds</em>, or memorable and well-crafted as <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. There’s plenty to like, and not enough to love, which for a series like <em>Zelda</em>, is less than we’ve come to expect.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6935"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-beds-bokoblin-and-beyond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-beds-bokoblin-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>TheGamer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a wonderful little game that puts experimentation at the centre, yet it also tries to be a traditional <em>Zelda </em>adventure with all the trimmings we’ve come to expect. It strikes an occasionally awkward balancing act between the two, coming out at the other end as a bold, accomplished outing that shines a spotlight on a Princess who has been waiting decades for her due. Yet despite how much joy I mined conquering its temples and delving into its many rifts, at times it doesn’t push its ambition far enough. That never stops <em>Echoes </em>from being a warm hug of a video game that enraptured me from start to finish, but it does leave me infinitely more curious about what the future holds. Now Zelda has helmed her first epic outing, it’s only a matter of time until she goes onto bigger and better things.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6936"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Digital Trends</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s best parts are the ones that break away from what’s expected. My favorite moments largely happen in Still World rifts, where I need to carve my own path through twisted snippets of Hyrule’s world using echoes. I’m attuned with Zelda most when I find a large gap I can’t pass, but realize I can get to the other side by grabbing hold of a flying tile with my bind ability and following its path. In clever puzzle platform moments like that, I feel like I’m tapping into her third of the Triforce; I’m using her wisdom to meet any challenge that arises. And I’m doing that by drawing on her connection to all things within her kingdom and communicating her eternal royalty through tangible play. This only feels like the true first chapter of Zelda’s saga, but I expect we’ll really see her grow into her element in her next adventure. Legends aren’t built in one game.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6937"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/455289/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/455289/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Polygon</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As much as E<em>choes of Wisdom</em> brings a real “this ain’t about him” energy to the series, it’s still a story just as much about Link as it is about Zelda. The context gives a justification (take it or leave it) for Zelda’s more passive role. But does it work? Simply put: It does. It’s a fun as hell game. It’s challenging and satisfying. And it fits neatly in the established mythos as another incarnation of our beloved hero(es). There’s a real sense of accomplishment in conducting a herd of boomerang-wielding Bokoblins as they pepper every enemy with attacks and then conjuring a bridge made of beds to cross an unjumpable gap. Sure, you might not be swinging the sword, but <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> proves that the pen — or the bed, table, crate, or boulder — can be even mightier.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6938"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-link-between-eras/1900-6418291/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-link-between-eras/1900-6418291/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>GameSpot</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>If Zelda’s debut in the spotlight is a one-off, at least it’s a memorable adventure. But hopefully this is the beginning of a new legend for the heroine. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s brilliantly integrates echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise’s classic formula. Don’t mistake this for a spin-off or minor entry between big “mainline” games:<em> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a major moment that shouldn’t be missed.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6939"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Eurogamer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Still, even through its missteps and occasional dead-ends, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is rarely content to just sit on its laurels. It forges its own path at almost every turn, challenging our understanding and expectations of how Hyrule’s flora and fauna can behave, while also unearthing new wrinkles that make its well-worn highways feel fresh and exciting again. For all Zelda’s apparent helplessness, the joy of discovering new Echoes and monster abilities never abates, drawing you deeper into its world instead of pushing you out of it. Ultimately, it’s a plucky and inventive spin on everything we know Zelda to be, reconciling the new and the old to create its own unique legacy, and a legend that befits a heroine who’s waited nearly four decades to own it - and all without becoming an unwilling puppet in someone else’s story (because let’s face it, Zelda’s no stranger to having her strings pulled at the eleventh hour). Far from being a case of chronic imposter syndrome, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> rises to the occasion with a lively and majestic confidence. Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait another 40 years before Zelda gets another shot at saving her hero again.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6940"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>The Verge</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I think that the singular ability to use Link’s sword gets at the heart of what’s ultimately disappointing about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>: all of Zelda’s wits don’t really amount to much. Sure I had dozens of echoes at my disposal, but halfway through the game, they only got in my way as I scrolled past them to get to the same five echoes I knew would get the job done. Combat was better, but whenever I wanted, I could thwart a difficult foe by simply stabbing it to death. That’s not to say <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> wasn’t fun. I wouldn’t have taken the time to clear every optional dungeon or most of the side quests if I hadn’t been enjoying myself. But after 35 years of lending her name to the iconic franchise, I wanted Zelda’s first game to be a little bit more worthy of her intelligence and strength.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As a result, the game seems to be trying to tackle more broad and complex themes about society and politics without actually coming out and saying it’s about those things. We’ll find out how well that works out next month. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"We apologize to everyone in Japan who was looking forward to it, but all of our staff will do our best to deliver it to PS5 users as soon as possible, so we hope you will wait for a little longer," read the statement. "We look forward to your continued support of Palworld."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It seems likely the delay has to do with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>, which was filed in the Tokyo District Court last week. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-responds-to-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-says-its-unaware-of-the-patents-its-accused-of-infringing"><u>Pocketpair issued a statement</u></a> in response claiming it had no idea which patents it’s accused of infringing, but experts have pointed to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-vs-palworld-killer-patent-may-be-about-the-mechanic-of-catching-pokmon">“killer patent” that revolves around the mechanic of catching Pokémon itself</a>.</p><p>After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route.</p><p>It is worth noting that Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, and this may prove the key to the lawsuit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>For now, Palworld’s PS5 Japan release is up in the air. But the game remains playable on all the platforms it originally launched in, including PC via Steam and Xbox. It’s also still in Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription program.</p><p>Pocketpair, meanwhile, continues to update Palworld amid the lawsuit. It’s just released patch 0.3.8, which makes a number of bug fixes.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Exactly 27 years after it debuted, Backyard Baseball '97 will be available again on October 10. Playground Productions has revealed the remaster of the original Backyard Sports game, which will cost $10 on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">The re-release of Backyard Baseball '97 apparently wasn't easy. Playground notes the original source code was "lost in the years since the 1997 release." As such, the company teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the sports game, which teamed up with diehard Backyard Sports fans in "hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds." The developer previously worked on titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wrestlequest-review-not-the-excellence-of-execution/1900-6418100/">WrestleQuest</a> and Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the Pit.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0HlEp-yq1E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r0HlEp-yq1E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"This was my favorite game growing up," said Playground founder and CEO Lindsay Barnett. "While we're already hard at work on the future of Backyard Sports, we first want to honor the past by restoring the games that started it all for me and so many others--beginning with Backyard Baseball '97."</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Playground announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/">Backyard Sports was back but didn't get into details</a>. Now, it's clear everything starts with Backyard Baseball '97. From there, the company plans to work with Mega Cat to expand the franchise on multiple platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Backyard Sports franchise originally began with Backyard Baseball in 1997 and then included games like Backyard Soccer, Backyard Basketball, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/taylor-swifts-boyfriend-and-his-brother-want-to-revive-backyard-football/1100-6520773/">Backyard Football--which the Kelce brothers wanted to revive</a>.

			<p>Metro Awakening VR was showcased during Sony's State of Play on September 24. It is a highly anticipated VR game set within the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/">Metro universe</a>. During the trailer, fans got a closer look at what to expect from the gameplay and storyline in Metro Awakening, where players explore the story of one of Metro's most pivotal characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metro Awakening | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-y4s1AwVBco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like the other games in the franchise, this title is also penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, and this game serves as a standalone prequel to Metro 2033, where the game follows the story of Serdar, a doctor who is exploring the harrowing tunnels in search of his missing wife. On his journey, his sanity is pushed to breaking point, and he often finds himself seeing and hearing things that aren't there before awakening as Khan, a legendary mystic figure. Khan's wisdom and understanding of the tunnels' supernatural forces will then continue to echo throughout the years, with Khan becoming a spiritual guide and shaping the fate of those who explore the Metro tunnels.</p>
<p>Metro Awakening is currently <a href="https://metroawakening.com/ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, with the game being compatible on the PS VR2, Meta Quest and Steam VR. There are two versions that players can pre-order: The Standard Edition, which includes some Field Medic cosmetics and a 10% discount for the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition gives those who purchase it a 48-hour Early Access to the full game, with the Early Access period being available only on the PS VR2 and Steam VR. The Deluxe Edition equally includes the Field Medic pack, as well as the Memories of Polyanka pack, which comes with Nosalis cosmetics. Finally, it will also include a digital VR Concept Art Gallery.</p>
<p>If you want to pre-order Metro Awakening, the Standard Edition will cost $39.99, and the Deluxe Edition will cost $44.99.</p>
<p>"The Metro franchise isn't just about survival; it's also about the powerful stories that emerge from its world. By collaborating with Dmitry, we've created something truly special—a deeply personal narrative that will resonate with both longtime fans and newcomers," says Martin de Ronde, Game and Creative Director at Vertigo Games.</p>
<p>This title is being developed and published by Vertigo Games in collaboration with Deep Silver. Vertigo Games is a VR-specific studio known for making games such as Arizona Sunshine and After the Fall. Deep Silver is, of course, known for Metro but has also created iconic franchises such as Dead Island and Saints Row titles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/six-days-in-fallujah%E2%80%99s-shocking-new-update-adds-single-player-missions.991635/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/six-days-in-fallujah-command-and-control-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Six Days in Fallujah is a storied game with a lengthy history. It was created hand-in-hand with the guidance of US Marines who were on the ground in Iraq in 2004, and it’s easily considered one of the most intense first-person shooters ever developed.</p>



<p>Recently, the ‘Command and Control’ update was unveiled by Victura, the game’s developer. This gargantuan update introduces shocking content that makes the game ‘the world’s first documentary videogame’. It also brings to the table the title’s first single-player missions, an AI fireteam, and more than 300 improvements.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-snap-back-to-reality">Snap Back to Reality</h2>



<p>Six Days in Fallujah isn’t a run-of-the-mill arcade shooter. It’s a gritty and harrowing FPS that plants you in the centre of procedurally-generated environments in which every angle and frame presents an imminent danger. It has received global praise because of its reluctance to sugarcoat what was a brutal and historic battle.</p>



<p>Command and Control, the next major update for Six Days in Fallujah, introduces an AI fireteam that can be controlled with the press of a button. It’ll allow users to navigate Six Days single-handedly, backed up by a genuinely intelligent AI squad that can provide cover fire, manoeuvre through obstacles, clear buildings, and watch crosses.</p>



<p>I saw the AI fireteam in action at Gamescom when I sat down with Victura and I was blown away by how intuitive it was.</p>

<p>This supersized update also introduces the first single-player campaign missions, which are based directly on events that happened during the battle in Fallujah in 2004. The gameplay has been fused with intense and somewhat shocking documentary scenes that show true-to-life violence and snippets of war, making players aware that what they’re experiencing was, at one point, <strong>not </strong>a game. </p>



<p>It has been little more than a year since Six Days in Fallujah was released on PC, and the Command and Control update is preparing to take things to the next level. It has had a graphical overhaul and the team has applied ‘more than 300 technical enhancements’ across the board.</p>



<p>Presently, the game is only available on PC, but there are expectations for a full release on consoles in 2025.</p>

We’re so proud of the engineers who worked long hours and overcame many obstacles to bring <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> back to the gaming community.”</p><div id="carousel_917409"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170540/Backyard_Baseball_97/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Play Like It’s 1997</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Relive the game that started it all! The original Backyard Baseball ’97, now enhanced to run on Steam. Whether you’re picking your dream team, hitting home runs, or just here for the witty banter, step back into the backyard and experience the game that made baseball fun for everyone!</p><p>Play pick-up games, practice batting, keep track of stats, compete in single games or a whole season – you can even set the rules! Backyard Baseball ‘97 features all of the realism and statistics of adult baseball games but with simple, intuitive controls that anyone can master.</p><p><strong>Batter Up, Playground Style</strong></p><p>The rules for Backyard Baseball are a hybrid of Major and Little League rules:</p><ul><li>No leading off</li><li>No Injuries</li><li>Bunting is allowed</li><li>Tagging up is allowed</li><li>You can also practice batting</li></ul><p>To get into the swing of things, choose a batter and face Mr. Clanky for some batting practice. This is where you’ll learn just when to click to make your chosen batter hit that ball!</p><p><strong>One Nation Under Pablo</strong></p><p>For many fans, this is the game that debuted one of the most iconic video game characters of the 90s or any era—the legend himself, Pablo Sanchez. Build a roster from a cast of 30 hilarious child athletes who made Backyard Baseball a cult classic.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Random Pick-Up</strong> – A quick way to jump right in! The computer chooses a random team for you and itself, and the game starts immediately.</li><li><strong>Single Game</strong> – You take turns with the computer, choosing players from a random pool of characters.</li><li><strong>Season</strong> – You create a team and manage the team through a 14 game series. The opposing teams are computer generated. At the end of the season the best two teams advance to the BBL playoffs (best of three). The playoffs winner advances to the championship series which consists of the Super Entire Nation Tournament (best of three) and then the Ultra Grand Championship of the Universe Series (best of five)!</li></ul><p><strong>Global Leaderboard</strong></p><p>Compete globally! Steam’s Leaderboard system lets you compete with friends and players around the world. Track your home runs, strike-outs, grand slams, season wins and more in real-time. See how you stack up and strive to reach the top!</p><p>At our core, we are fans first–not just of video games but of the Backyard Sports franchise. Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original Backyard titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t support gamepads, nor the Steam deck, in these original titles. We can’t use the original 32bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p><p>We can make the game run buttery smooth, stack it with Steam achievements to test your mettle and give you a chance to batter up to compete in the Steam Global Leaderboards for Home Runs. Baseball 1997 runs well, looks better than ever, and creates a new installation for digital preservation within the Backyard Sports catalog that allows the next generation of fans to fall in love with the title that started it all.</p><p><strong>Development</strong></p><p>With the original source code lost in the years since the 1997 release, Playground Productions has teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the original titles and bring them to modern devices. Forming a team of avid gamers and <em>Backyard Sports</em> enthusiasts, Mega Cat accomplished a near-impossible feat by hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds to be compatible with current generation PCs. It was a meticulous process that took a considerable amount of time and effort to revitalize the game. Given the intricacies involved in this remaster, <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> is only compatible with PC devices at this time, but both Mega Cat and Playground Productions are working diligently to ensure <em>Backyard Sports</em> becomes available on multiple platforms moving forward.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has surprise-launched&nbsp;creature-collecting survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on PS5, although if you're in Japan, then you're sadly out of luck on that front, possibly due to what's happening with regards to Nintendo.</p>
<p><em>Palworld</em>'s PS5 launch was announced during yesterday's PlayStation State of Play show, where we also got reveals like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date</a> and the existence of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025">followup to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, among other things.</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal">teamed up with Sony</a> to expand the game beyond the world of video games back in July,&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s PS5 release probably shouldn't come as too much of a shock, but it's a pleasant surprise for PS5 players nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-ps5-release-field.jpg?itok=eBaeUE_G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-ps5-release-field.jpg?itok=UU4A2s9r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is now available on PS5 (although this shot is from the PC version).</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, it gets a bit more complicated if you're looking to play&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on PS5 in Japan. According to the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1838716479136763971" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the game's Japanese PS5 release date hasn't been decided yet.</p>
<p>Of course, Pocketpair doesn't specifically name the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement lawsuit</a> it was recently served by Nintendo, but it's not hard to read between the lines and guess that's the reason for the game's no-show in Japan on PS5.</p>
<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s release on PS5 coincides with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4700159105815693532" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an update released for the game today</a>, and while it's not a major update, it does fix a few bugs, including one in which Pals would get stuck in your base and one that would send you underground when starting a game.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a creature-collecting survival sim akin to something like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved&nbsp;</em>(whatever the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-unleash-more-unspeakable-quasi-pokemon-brutality-and-cuddles">"<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with guns" descriptors</a> might have you believe).</p>
<p>The game sees you teaming up with creatures called Pals in order to do battle with other Pals, build a base, and generally eke out a life for yourself. It's in Early Access right now, but future updates will include new Pals, new dungeons, and "more pronounced and enjoyable" survival elements.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6360-PPSA23126_00-0112788005082769" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. Even if the Switch could run the game, I'm guessing a Switch version probably isn't going to happen anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>An entire campaign walkthrough of a Call of Duty: Ghosts Alpha, codenamed Phantom, has leaked online. </p>



<p>The complete walkthrough comes from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alpha-archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alpha Archive</a>, who uploaded over three hours of the footage to their YouTube channel. You can watch the full campaign walkthrough below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the video description, the following footage comes from a build of the game that was released on May 8, 2023. This means that the footage originates from a build that was only six months away from release, showcasing the amount of work that Call of Duty developers need to do in such a short space of time. </p>



<p>Two weeks after this apparent build, Infinity Ward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxnx3W-HA18&amp;ab_channel=CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed Call of Duty Ghosts</a> to the public.</p>



<p>The game was a massive success for Call of Duty despite the series moving away from the ‘Black Ops’ and ‘Modern Warfare’ brands (although it did sell less than Black Ops 2). Within 24 hours of release, it generated over $1 billion in sales, and as of February 2024, it had sold 19 million units. </p>



<p>Call of Duty Ghosts released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, and PC on November 5, 2013. </p>



<p>What do you think of the stage of the Ghosts campaign six months from release?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/381/">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

<p>Pocket Pair <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-launches-for-ps5-consoles-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow dropped</a> Palworld for PS5 consoles yesterday in 68 countries and regions worldwide, but Japan wasn’t included in the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest post by the Japanese Pocket Pair account on <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1838716479136763971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the developers have yet to decide on a release date for Palworld’s PS5 version in Japan. They have apologised to the Japanese community and promised that their staff is doing their best to deliver this version as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players speculate that Palworld’s PS5 version has been delayed in Japan due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo and the Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against the developers</a>. Nintendo has alleged that the game “infringes multiple patent rights”. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-lawsuit-reponse-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket Pair has already responded</a>, stating they are “unaware” of the specific patents they have been accused of infringing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld, dubbed “Pokémon with Guns,” was released at the beginning of 2024. The game quickly rose to fame, becoming the second-most played game on Steam at the time and attracting over 25 million players.</p>



<p>Palworld is an open-world, multiplayer, survival-crafting game where you use creatures called Pals to do your bidding. Players can use these Pals to fight or work at farms or factories. Players also have the option to sell the Pals or eat them.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sony's State of Play broadcast on September 24 included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">a bunch of big news</a>, but perhaps the most significant announcement came at the end when Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima sequel was revealed. The sequel is not Ghost of Tsushima 2, or Ghost of Twoshima, as some envisioned. Instead, Sucker Punch is making a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-a-ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-announced-at-state-of-play/1100-6526653/" data-ref-id="1100-6526653">Ghost of Yotei</a>, which features a new hero and a different time period.</p><p>In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about Ghost of Yotei, including its release window, story, characters, and setting.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Ghost of Yotei be released?</h2><p>Ghost of Yotei is in the works for PlayStation 5 and is set for release at some point in 2025. A specific release date has not been announced, however. The first game, Ghost of Tsushima, was released in July 2020.</p><h2>Preorder Ghost of Yotei sequel</h2><p>Ghost of Yotei was only just announced on September 24 and is not yet available to preorder.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Ghost of Yotei was released during the September PlayStation State of Play briefing. The impressive three-minute trailer began with an ominous-sounding voiceover setting things up. "We are beyond the edge of Japan. People come north to disappear," a character says, before the trailer shows Mount Yotei and reveals a year in time--1603. "But you, you are hunting, and now, every ronin here is after you." The trailer then introduces Ghost of Yotei's main character, Atsu, before diving into a montage of sorts showing all manner of environments, people, and places players will journey throughout the game, along with some of the weapons like swords and rifles from Feudal Japan.</p><p>"Our trailer offers a glimpse into this world, but there's so much more to show, and we'll have much more to share in the months ahead, including details about Atsu's journey and the people (and animals) she'll meet along the way," the developer said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1615219349" data-promo-id="0"

It is Sucker Punch's first game "built from the ground up" for the PS5. "We're excited to build on the visual foundation we established in Ghost of Tsushima by making the world feel even more real," the developer said.</p><p>Players can expect "massive sightlines," new skies featuring auroras and twinkling stars, and "more believable movement" from how the wind hits grass and vegetations. The developer said the new setting also provides the team an opportunity to utilize "new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons."</p><p>Sucker Punch did not mention how Ghost of Yotei might take advantage of the increased power of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a>, or if the game could ever release on PC.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Ghost of Yotei is set in 1603, which is more than 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima. That means the first game's hero, Jin, is not featured in this game. Sucker Punch said it wanted to make something "fresh but familiar," and this meant looking beyond Jin and the island of Tsushima.</p><p>"At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yotei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore," the studio said.</p><p>Sucker Punch went on to say it is holding back specifics on the story for the time being. But what it can say is that the game takes place in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, a massive mountain in Ezo, which today is known as Hokkaido.</p><p>"In 1603, this area was outside the rule of Japan, and filled with sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers. It's a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima, and it's the setting for an original story we can't wait to tell," Sucker Punch said.</p><p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> that, upon visiting Shiretoko National Park, where he recorded nature sounds for the game, he witnessed the beauty and danger therein.</p><p>"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," Fox said. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying. We strive to bring that into the video game--that feeling of danger."</p><p>Atsu is portrayed by Erika Ishii (Apex Legends, Mortal Kombat 1) in Ghost of Yotei.</p><h2><strong>Is Ghost of Yotei open-world?</strong></h2><p>Ghost of Yotei is an open-world game, and that came with its own set of unique challenges. Jason Connell, the co-creative director, told The New York Times, "One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again."</p><p>Players will have access to a variety of weaponry, including melee weapons like a katana as well as firearms. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences," Connell said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373076-746adce92f7340db6569595774003b98026934c4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373076-746adce92f7340db6569595774003b98026934c4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373076"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei is coming to PS5 in 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373076-746adce92f7340db6569595774003b98026934c4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373077-1a51feadac24df93d5067c20c6815cb5eb3b7846.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373078-1bfb5b0efbe05409fd2d5ab0054a34799700695d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373079-1cc02bccfaea1392d820dc02fcaaedd73bf598f8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373080-2e47be0ef25d627e82605a9b0cc5cd4567494c75.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373081-3a0e4445c27987450bb2193573f6deefbea0752d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373082-7cb6e884f7fb4368e4b9e9b4fc92873d8b8bd777.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373083-18bcb3eae57654c7b3a259528bf3c4ffcb65ee6a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373084-31c065baafbcb3016390c887fb544229554867e0.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373085-68f8b931e13f633d99838a33d3ea46cf51a6b082.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373086-387b852c584baf8cff17a93f323e413ed052cd9a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373077,1300-4373078,1300-4373079,1300-4373080,1300-4373081,1300-4373082,1300-4373083,1300-4373084,1300-4373085,1300-4373086" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373077-1a51feadac24df93d5067c20c6815cb5eb3b7846.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373078-1bfb5b0efbe05409fd2d5ab0054a34799700695d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373079-1cc02bccfaea1392d820dc02fcaaedd73bf598f8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373080-2e47be0ef25d627e82605a9b0cc5cd4567494c75.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373081-3a0e4445c27987450bb2193573f6deefbea0752d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373082-7cb6e884f7fb4368e4b9e9b4fc92873d8b8bd777.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373083-18bcb3eae57654c7b3a259528bf3c4ffcb65ee6a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373084-31c065baafbcb3016390c887fb544229554867e0.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373085-68f8b931e13f633d99838a33d3ea46cf51a6b082.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373086-387b852c584baf8cff17a93f323e413ed052cd9a.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373077-1a51feadac24df93d5067c20c6815cb5eb3b7846.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373078-1bfb5b0efbe05409fd2d5ab0054a34799700695d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373079-1cc02bccfaea1392d820dc02fcaaedd73bf598f8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373080-2e47be0ef25d627e82605a9b0cc5cd4567494c75.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373081-3a0e4445c27987450bb2193573f6deefbea0752d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373082-7cb6e884f7fb4368e4b9e9b4fc92873d8b8bd777.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373083-18bcb3eae57654c7b3a259528bf3c4ffcb65ee6a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373084-31c065baafbcb3016390c887fb544229554867e0.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373085-68f8b931e13f633d99838a33d3ea46cf51a6b082.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373086-387b852c584baf8cff17a93f323e413ed052cd9a.jpg"></figure><h2>Who's developing Ghost of Yotei?</h2><p>Sucker Punch, the team that made Ghost of Tsushima, is returning to develop Ghost of Yotei.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei development news</h2><p>Sucker Punch said when it was considering a sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, the team wanted to "maintain the core pillars" from the first game. That meant taking on the role of a warrior in Feudal Japan, giving players the opportunity to explore the world at their own pace and experience the world's beauty.</p><p>Fox told The New York Times, "When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves is, 'What is the DNA of a Ghost game?.'" "It is about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan."</p><p>Ghost of Tsushima was a huge hit for PlayStation, selling 13 million copies, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, so it was likely only a matter of time before a sequel was confirmed. The paper also reported that "other spinoffs" are in the works.</p><h2><strong>Ghost of Tsushima movie</strong></h2><p>In addition to Ghost of Yotei, Sony is making a Ghost of Tsushima movie via its PlayStation Productions division. PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst told The New York Times that these kind of transmedia efforts are just good business when done right.</p><p>"From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense," he said. "When a television series or movie comes out, people are inspired to play again or make friends to play."</p><p>John Wick director Chad Stahelski is attached to direct the Ghost of Tsushima movie, though there haven't been any significant updates on the film in some time. In November 2023, Stahelski said making a movie is "always tricky," but that, at the time, the team was "very close to getting our sh** together..."</p><p>Stahelski is attached to a number of upcoming projects, including the Ghosts of Tsushima movie, a Highlander film, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-b-jordan-to-star-in-rainbow-six-movie-from-john-wick-director-report/1100-6510630/" data-ref-id="1100-6510630">Rainbow Six film</a>. He said the two that are the "closest" and that he's most interested in right now are the Highlander and Ghost of Tsushima projects.</p><p>"Both amazing, amazing properties, the story of Ghost is, also, one of my favorite properties of all time," he said. Whether or not Stahelski makes Highlander or Ghosts of Tsushima first remains to be seen.</p><p>Among other things, Stahelski is working on how they can "push the color palette" on the Ghost of Tsushima movie. "How can you bring that world to life in a very realistic and grounded way?" he said.</p><p>Before this, Stahelski said the success of HBO's The Last of Us TV series demonstrates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-director-says-tlou-show-proves-video-game-adaptations-can-be-good/1100-6512452/" data-ref-id="1100-6512452">a good video game adaptation "can be done."</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-generated-image-of-nintendos-mario-are-being-expunged-from-the-internet-by-ai<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>An AI powered copyright tool is being used to remove AI generated images of Nintendo characters such as Mario from the internet.</p>
<p>That's according to a report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252410/nintendo-dmca-notices-mario-fan-art-ai-image-detection">The Verge</a>, whose own reporter Tom Warren received a takedown notice for his AI generated artwork, which showed Mario sitting on a beach with a cigarette in one hand and a steaming (not sure why) pint of beer in the other.</p>
<p>The publication said a company called Tracer has been filing these takedown notices against AI images featuring Nintendo's moustachioed plumber and his pals, including ones made with xAI's <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-2">Grok AI tool</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.tracer.ai/">Tracer's website</a>, the company uses "human-in-the-Loop AI and machine learning to dramatically shorten the time from detection to enforcement by intelligently automating the review process and automatically offering an enforcement recommendation".</p>
<p>While The Verge's own Nintendo-related artwork has been removed, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>-inspired image depicting Xbox's Master Chief playing a PlayStation 5 remains (see post below). Meanwhile, another <a href="https://x.com/TheMidwestFella/status/1837027062323786069">affected account</a> which generated an image of Luigi as an IDF soldier with the Grok AI tool also said its content has been removed from the internet.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I have also come across a clearly AI-generated image of Mario in possession of drugs still on X, so not all images have been removed by the AI tool.</p>

<p>It is currently unclear whether Tracer is acting on instructions from Nintendo, although the Mario maker is notoriously protective of its property. Most recently, it announced it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Palworld developer Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps an unexpected side effect of this AI purge by an AI tool, however, is that fanart has also reportedly been removed from social media accounts. "Apparently drawing Nintendo characters [is] copyright infringement," shared one <a href="https://x.com/OtakuRockU_/status/1838289702052405522/photo/1">X user</a>, with an image of their own takedown notice.</p>
<p>Neither Nintendo or Tracer have commented on these takedown notices yet, although Eurogamer has reached out for more.</p>

<p>AI remains a hot topic within the video game industry, with many concerned about its impact on the sector. Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> admitted it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI technology for Foamstars</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sparks-debate-by-unveiling-ai-tool-to-aid-scriptwriting">Ubisoft unveiled an AI scriptwriting aid in 2023</a>. More recently, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">report by Unity</a> claimed 62 percent of studios use AI at some point during game development, with animation as the top use case.</p>
<p>For more, our Ed spoke with AI expert Dr. Tommy Thompson all about the technology, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">how it is changing video game development forever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, a followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>that takes place more than 300 years after the original game. It's due to arrive for PS5 in 2025.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's PlayStation Showcase,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>tells the story of Atsu, a warrior who must contend with the "sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers" of 1600s Hokkaido, which was then known as Ezo.</p>
<p>In the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, we learn that Atsu is hunting someone in the Ezo region, and in the environs of Mount Yōtei specifically. However, an unsavory figure then tells an offscreen Atsu that she's also being hunted by "every ronin" in the region, at which point Atsu kills him. Only fair, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-atsu-forest.jpg?itok=m0Lvu-vl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-atsu-forest.jpg?itok=LWefafvX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is the followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We then get to see a montage of shots and scenes from the game, all of which look exactly as breathtakingly impressive as you'd expect from the folks who brought you&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony explains that it wanted to look "beyond Jin Sakai's story" in order to explore "what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask", with the aim being to "create something fresh but familiar".</p>
<p>Protagonist Atsu will be voiced by none other than&nbsp;<em>Dimension 20</em>'s Erika Ishii. You can take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">our interview with her (as well as Siobhan Thompson) right here</a> if you want to do a little homework before&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s release.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is more of an atmospheric mood-setter than an explanatory piece, right here.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is set hundreds of years after the original, Sucker Punch says it'll have the chance to introduce "new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons" to the game.</p>
<p>The studio is keeping the story pretty closely under wraps right now, but it's safe to assume you'll be exploring gorgeous locales in pursuit of whatever Atsu's goal happens to be. We'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>
<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for PS5 next year. At the moment, there's no word of a simultaneous PC version, but since&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and">came to PC eventually</a>, we can likely expect this one to do the same at some point. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>This year Nintendo finally gave its iconic princesses the royal treatment, putting both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Peach</a> and Zelda center stage in their own games. But with all due respect to the monarch of the Mushroom Kingdom, the head of Hyrule’s adventure isn’t just another second-tier spinoff. Trust me when I say that in every way that matters, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom <em>is</em> the next mainline Zelda game (the 2D line, at least). It takes all of the linear dungeon crawling and key item-style progression I’ve missed from the older games in this series and perfectly combines them with the ridiculously clever, freeform problem solving that made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a> so captivating. It doesn’t always take this exciting step forward with unflappable royal grace, but it’s still easily become one of my favorite Zelda games – with or without a green tunic on my back. </p><p>While there are plenty of substantial mechanical changes to the way Echoes of Wisdom plays as compared to its predecessors, the practical differences of its main character switcheroo are actually pretty negligible – there were even a couple of times during my roughly 23-hour playthrough where I briefly got confused by a conversation because I legitimately forgot I wasn’t Link. Perhaps the most surprising difference to me, however, was how it makes the story that much more engaging. Rather than being yet another remix of a destined, mute swordsman’s journey to save the day, Zelda is <em>the</em> central character of the plot. As a result, I felt much more important and involved as I explored Hyrule to seal the mysterious purple rifts that were forming across my kingdom.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Of course, the most consistent reminder that you aren’t Link is the more indirect way Zelda actually interacts with that world and fights the wide variety of enemies within it. Thanks to a little floating friend named Tri who accompanies you, you have the power to create echoes of any enemy you defeat and an array of specific objects you come across. That means defeating a Moblin once will let you summon it to automatically fight for you in the future, and you’ll frequently create beds, boxes, and even trampolines to clear gaps or climb ledges as you explore. The menu you use to swap between your collection of summonable creatures and items does quickly balloon into an annoying-to-navigate pile, but it’s so cool that the number of echoes you can actually have out at the same time is only capped by an upgradable point system – starting at three and going up from there – and that always feels fun to plan around rather than than overly limiting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It encourages the same "break the game” creativity as Tears.</p></div><p>Echoes encourages the same “go ahead and break our game” creativity that Nintendo embraced with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a> and doubled down on with Tears of the Kingdom, but this time in a 2D Zelda game that borrows the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link’s Awakening</a> remake’s delightfully toy-like art style and occasional side-scrolling segments (as well as a bit of its inconsistent framerate, which isn’t wildly distracting but does also feel sort of inexcusable at this point. Where’s that Switch 2, Nintendo?). </p><p>I get that the echo system may sound far too quirky to be considered anything but an experimental spinoff of the traditional sword and shield combat we’ve seen in pretty much every 2D Zelda since the original in 1986, but the reason it’s able to stay so distinctly Zelda is because many of these echoes essentially act as classic key items. You may not have a hookshot, but that floating floor tile you’ll only find in a certain cave can suddenly let you clear large pits in a similar way; there’s no shovel this time, but a little mole friend will happily dig up secrets for you; and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review">Skyward Sword</a>’s Gust Bellows isn’t back, but holding a Wind Cannon above your head will clear away piles of sand just as well.</p><p>The fact that so many of the most useful echoes are either tucked away in optional caves or found in dungeons (alongside some important central abilities, like Tri’s power to lift and move any object, Ultra Hand-style) gives Echoes of Wisdom a sense of progression that I must admit I missed while playing Breath of the Wild and its sequel. You still have immense freedom to explore where you want and solve problems in unexpected ways, but I love that you also have that classic Zelda feeling of leaving most dungeons with something new in your pocket. Sure, sometimes you’ll just get another middling summonable monster you’ll probably never use – but other times you’ll casually be handed something like the Water Block, a Minecraft-like cube which fundamentally changed how I moved around the map by letting me swim up or along walls with ease. </p><p>The exceptional puzzle rooms in Echoes of Wisdom also make great use of the absurd range of options you are given. Seeing a chest just out of reach would get my mind racing right away as I thought back through the exhaustive list of stuff I could summon that might help me out. That could be as simple as creating a monster to hit a switch for me, or as weird as stacking multiple things in just the right way to let me grab an object with Tri and then lift it past a series of obstacles and onto a button from afar. There is rarely one right answer, and the “a-ha!” moments are plentiful. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Exceptional puzzles make great use of your absurd range of options.</p></div><p>That said, the one place Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t really benefit from being built entirely around summons is combat. While puzzles really are more of the focus this time around, there’s essentially just as much combat as ever as well, and summoning a few echoes only to watch them slowly attack your target isn’t exactly thrilling stuff. This is coming from someone who typically <em>loves</em> playing as summoning classes in games like Diablo or Frosthaven, but in those instances you usually aren’t just spawning in a few dudes and then sitting on your hands until they finish the job. You do get some faster or harder-hitting options (the wide-spinning Peahat was an early favorite of mine) as you go, and fights are by no means unpleasant or anything like that, but swinging a sword as Link is still just fundamentally more fun. </p><p>Thankfully, Zelda isn’t a helpless damsel who relies entirely on others to fight for her: she literally has Link’s sword and can swap to “Swordfighter Mode” to attack directly at pretty much any time. However, your energy bar drains quickly while in that form, and that resource is limited enough that you can’t rely on it too heavily. The bar can be upgraded, but running out in the middle of a harder fight or a boss can be a real hassle if you don’t have any energy recovery items on hand, so I was always a little cautious about when I chose to pull out my blade. That means your combat options are essentially letting someone else handle fights or taking matters into your own hands with the pressure of a ticking clock, both of which <em>are </em>entertaining, but not to the same buttery smooth degree that echoes improve exploration and puzzle solving. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Combat does at least get a little more interesting later on thanks to the completely optional (and surprisingly easy-to-miss) automaton system. This small selection of buildable robots don’t cost any points to pull out of your pocket, but you can only use one at a time, they need to then be wound up manually before they start doing their job, and you’ll have to pay to repair them if they take too much damage. The payoff can be worth it though, with options like a Deku Baba that can eat enemies whole and a sword-wielding Moblin with a slow but massive area-of-effect slice. That makes them a pretty neat high risk/high reward option, and gives you a little more to do after summoning echoes in combat without having to spend any energy.</p><p>Another way automaton power is balanced is that you have to assist one character in constructing by completing a series of side quests – and Echoes of Wisdom has a <em>lot</em> of side quests. While it took me roughly 23 hours to roll credits, you could certainly make it there much faster if you are mainlining the story. My playthrough was fairly comprehensive, completing every quest I could find and hunting down collectibles, but I also wasn’t shooting for 100% completion. Going out of my way always felt worth it, be that because of the tangible rewards I would get, the useful new echoes I might find, the charming characters and stories I would encounter (a village of adorable Deku Scrubs obsessed with sweets is a real highlight to look out for), or the multiple entirely optional mini-dungeons I could complete, each of which has its own unique boss fight. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tom's Top 10 Zelda Games</h3><p>Here is my personal top 10 Zelda games in order.</p></div><p>Exploring Hyrule in search of these extras is one of the clearest places that Echoes of Wisdom feels like a Zelda chimera – an explicit hybrid of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/23/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-vc-review">A Link to the Past</a> and Tears of the Kingdom. Longtime fans will notice that parts of the map are nearly exact replicas of the SNES terrain, down to the little elevated platform just south of Hyrule Castle that Link’s house was on (though it’s absent here). Meanwhile, other areas have defining features of the Breath of the Wild map where you would expect them, from the Gerudo village in the southwest to an electricity-filled jungle in the southeast. The Zora are even split into two rival tribes: one with the fishtail heads of their modern design and the other with the finned-faces of the ones that would pop out of the water to attack you more than 30 years ago. In that way, Echoes of Wisdom feels like Nintendo fully embracing both the past and the present of Zelda, mixing what this series used to be and what Breath of the Wild so abruptly pivoted toward into a single game that honors and makes the best of both halves. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s unabashedly odd, reveling in the unexpected with writing that constantly had me bursting out laughing at jokes I’d heard a dozen times before.
