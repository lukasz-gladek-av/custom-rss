            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA is set to announce the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>release date later today, but it looks like the release date may already have leaked, along with the associated trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by Wario64 on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the trailer was uploaded to Streamable in its entirety earlier today. It's not a long trailer, clocking in at around 21 seconds, but it states the release date clear as day at its conclusion: October 31st.</p>
<p>The trailer isn't actually set to air until around 12pm Eastern, so it's possible that someone at EA accidentally set the video to go live at 12AM instead. Hey, mistakes happen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-combat.jpg?itok=etsmhprc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-combat.jpg?itok=2atjFux7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is apparently set to release in late October.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>(formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em>) was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard">formally unveiled in June</a>, speculation has swirled regarding its 2024 release date, but it now looks like that speculation can be put to rest.</p>
<p>It's been a strange journey for <i>Veilguard</i>. The latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-named-as-next-dragon-age-game">revealed as&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>back in 2022</a>, and the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-reaches-dragon-age-dreadwolf-alpha-milestone">completed its alpha development milestone</a> in October that same year.</p>
<p>Following that, however, BioWare fell relatively silent with regards to&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf</em>, until it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-be-fully-revealed-in-summer-2024">announced in December last year</a> that the game would be fully revealed this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The studio held to that promise, and the game, along with its new name, got its first gameplay reveal in June. If you're a long-time&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fan, you might notice some changes around the place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-monuments.jpg?itok=Mz8N7OSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-monuments.jpg?itok=Vd09Vu-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>has had a long and strange journey.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">lean further towards action</a> than even its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Inquisition&nbsp;</em>did, so if you were hoping for a return to the classic real-time-with-pause CRPG combat for which the first game became known, you're out of luck, sadly.</p>
<p>However, if you're just hoping to start up a loving relationship with one of your companions, you'll be pleased to know they're all romanceable, a move about which&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>creator David Gaider <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-creator-veilguard-romance">has expressed reservations</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>launches on October 31st, if the above leak is anything to go by. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">check out our preview of the game here</a> to find out how it plays.</p>

            <p>I was all set to plunge into Blackbird and Gearbox's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a> this spring when I received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">a slightly underwhelmed intergalactic transmission from Nic</a>, praising the game's atmosphere and story while ruminating over fussy controls and a want of tactical depth. Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles. </p><!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure if <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1840080/eventcomments/4513255804484823645?snr=1_5_9_">today's free Homeworld 3 update</a> is the one I'm waiting for, but it does encompass "a host of gameplay improvements, bug fixes, [and] free Skirmish maps". It will launch alongside the Kalan Fleet pack DLC, which adds two new fleets to the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim's roguelike War Games mode - including the Kalan Raiders from the story - along with three new ships.</p>
<p>The Kalan Raider fleet are a mix of Kalan and repurposed Hiigaran ships. The other new fleet is the Capture Fleet, who blend Incarnate with Kalan vessels - guess what they're good at. If you guessed "stealing other people's carriers", then go away and sulk, for I have no medals to give out. The DLC also includes 11 new challenges and 40 Artifacts. I don't get the sense that all of this will address the complaints I'm reading on the Steam forums about the single player campaign and - oh wow, the current Steam user review consensus is Overwhelmingly Negative. Is it <em>really</em> that bad?</p>
<p>Revealed to much rejoicing in 2019, Homeworld 3 has had a troubled gestation. It was repeatedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-delayed-till-may-to-incorporate-player-feedback-to-war-games-demo">delayed to address player feedback</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-the-homeworld-3-devs-are-improving-the-game-after-delaying-release-over-demo-feedback">the controls proving a particular bugbear</a>. Creators Blackbird <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-studio-blackbird-interactive-hit-with-layoffs">laid off staff in February this year</a> following some unannounced project cancellations.</p>
<p>According to Blackbird's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-dlc-plans-revealed-alongside-collectors-edition-with-model-spaceships">season pass roadmap from April</a>, we can expect another paid Homeworld 3 DLC in October which adds a new playable faction, starting fleets, faction artifacts and challenges. There's also a further free update in the works with maps and challenges for around the end of the year. A third paid DLC pack and free update combo are planned for 2025, with a similar balance of goodies.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine all that moving the needle of player reaction, but still - best of luck, Blackbird. This is deep space survey ship USG Evans-Thirlwell, signing off until further notice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, developer Warhorse Studios announced that its anticipated sequel Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will launch on February 11, 2025. </p>



<p>Fans originally expected the game to release sometime in late 2024, following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-releasing-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak on IGN</a> in April 2024. </p>



<p>However, today’s post also included details on future reveals, including the developer’s plans for Gamescom.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios confirmed it will reveal a new gameplay showcase for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 with over 20 minutes of footage. This will release on August 21, along with a playable version, first impressions, and a Collector’s Edition reveal. </p>



<p>Fans got a small glimpse of the Collector’s Edition box during the video accompanying today’s release date announcement post.</p>

The official release date for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCD2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KCD2</a> is 11 February 2025.<br>It's a long wait, but we have a lot to show you between now and release, starting with:<br>⚔️ 20+ min gameplay showcase at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gamescom2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gamescom2024</a><br>⚔️ Collectors Edition Reveal<br>⚔️ Previews from Press and… <a href="https://t.co/YSJrxdZZZT">pic.twitter.com/YSJrxdZZZT</a></p>— Warhorse Studios (@WarhorseStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Warhorse Studios revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first gameplay trailer</a> for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 during Summer Game Fest 2024. </p>



<p>Although the devs acknowledged that February is “a long wait,” they also pointed out that it lines up with the release week of the first Kingdom Come. Fans remain patient and supported plans for a smooth launch.</p>



<p>Last month, Martin Ziegler of Warhorse Studios offered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some in-depth details</a> on the making of the game during a new interview. They revealed behind-the-scenes efforts to create something as authentic and immersive as possible.</p>



<p>Ziegler added that “we’re introducing many iterative changes to the combat,” aiming to add more depth and make it more accessible too.</p>

			<p>Forza Horizon 5 will be the next former Xbox console exclusive from Microsoft to release on PlayStation 5, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As revealed by the reliable <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1823894370040373519?t=brqrJCUvYX180NOKKmjyzg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXtas1s</a>, the latest entry in the series is coming to PlayStation 5 soon, within the next few months. The timing of the announcement is not clear, but the leaker has no doubt the game is coming to Sony's current generation console.</p>
<p>Besides revealing the Forza Horizon 5 PS5 port, eXstas1s also commented on the highly anticipated port of Starfield, saying that there are no active plans for it yet. This is hardly surprising, considering Bethesda's RPG launched not even<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"> a year ago.</a></p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 may not be the Xbox exclusive PlayStation 5 owners have been waiting for the most, but it's still great news that more players will be able to enjoy Playground Games' excellent racing game. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made. Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good.</em></p>

<p>Indiana Jones The Great Circle is still launching in 2024 and will be given a release date at Opening Night Live on August 20.</p>



<p>Earlier in August, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/">Xbox delayed Avowed to February 18, 2025</a>, which was said to be because Xbox Game Pass had a plethora of games launching in late 2024. Shortly after the announcement, speculation online turned to Indiana Jones and its lack of release date. However, according to a preview event that took place this week, Xbox has said that the game is on track to launch in 2024 and that its release date will be announced at Opening Night Live at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the exact date wasn’t announced during the preview event.</p>



<p>Officially, we know that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be getting a “new look” during Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>Earlier today, rumours began circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-game-coming-to-playstation-next-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Xbox game would be coming to PlayStation</a>, with an announcement coming sometime next week. So far, the rumors seem to indicate that the game will be Forza Horizon 5. eXtas1s, a leaker who has gained a reputation for Xbox Game Pass leaks simply tweeted a GIF saying “Feliz Cinco de Mayo”, implying Forza Horizon, however, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/rumor-another-big-xbox-game-is-heading-to-ps5-to-be-announced-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jez Corden of Windows Central</a>&nbsp;claims that a port is going to be announced next week, but it’s not expected to be Forza Horizon 5 at this time.</p>



<p>Are you excited tog et your hands on Indiana Jones later this year? Let us know down in the comments below!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-on-xbox-is-%E2%80%9Cgoing-to-happen%E2%80%9D-known-leaker-says.953700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-happen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI has yet to be released on platforms other than the PlayStation 5, but according to rumors circulating online, Square Enix has more in the works than the announced PC port.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot31-perfect-doom.894510/post-127183653">ResetERA forums,</a> well-known leaker NateDrake talked about the latest main entry in the series coming to Xbox consoles, saying that it is going to happen without adding much more. While next week's Gamescom would be perfect for an announcement, the fact that the PC port has yet to receive an official release date suggests that Square Enix may wait a little longer to make an announcement.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S wouldn't exactly be surprising, considering Square Enix and Microsoft collaborated for Final Fantasy XIV release on the consoles. Naoki Yoshida himself<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-director-wants-as-many-as-possible-to-play-the-game-possibly-hinting-at-xbox-launch-after-pc/"> confirmed</a> that they would like to make the game available for as many people as possible, heavily hinting at the unannounced Xbox version of the game.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now out on PlayStation 5 and should be released on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-driver-profile/">before long</a>. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-looks-gorgeous-in-the-latest-developer-diary/">Skyblivion</a> gameplay footage was shared online, providing a new look at the mod, which will attempt to remake the fourth entry in The Elder Scrolls series using Skyrim's engine.</p>
<p>The new footage, which can be watched below, showcases a big part of the map and multiple quests set in the shown areas that seem to have been recreated quite faithfully from the original. Hopefully, the rest of the project will feature the same level of quality as the sequences shown in the new footage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Oblivion Remastered Gameplay First Look | SKYBLIVION Quest Showcase 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQohYRzybBg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Skyblivion has been in development for quite some time, but thankfully the wait won't be much longer as the total conversion mod is still targeting a 2025 release. Once it launches, players will be able to experience the entirety of Oblivion like they never did before with both Skyrim Legacy Edition and Skyrim Special Edition, with reimagined and improved cities, homes, caves, dungeons, and forts across Cyrodiil with new and improved layouts and encounters, new creatures and monsters featuring lore-friendly additions from the rest of the series, new loading screens, class cards, attribute art and much more.</p>
<p>More information on Skyblivion can be found on its <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">official website</a>. As mentioned above, the mod is scheduled for a 2025 release.</p>

            <p>Put your mortar and pestle down, my herb-smooshing friend. The peasant-quelling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> antics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> won't be releasing this year after all, say developers Warhorse <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374"> in a video message to fans</a>. "We aimed for the end of the year, and almost made it," said PR man Tobi Stolz-Zwilling. "Almost is not good enough though, so unfortunately we slipped to 2025."  Never mind, it's easy to slip in the medieval era. There was mud everywhere.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They do now have a firmer release date for the game though, as opposed to a vague "2024". It'll be out on February 11th, they say. There's also talk of upcoming previews and a presence at Gamescom. Oh, hey! We'll be at Gamescom! James? JAMES. Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on your itinerary for Gamescom?</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> It is not, apologies.</p>
<p>Ah, jeez. How are we going to know what this sequel will be like? Well, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-will-once-again-be-boys-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-revealed-today-for-2024-release">lengthy reveal trailer</a> shown earlier this year gives us some clues. It'll continue the story of peasant-born adventurer Henry, and be set mostly in the Czech city of Kuttenberg. Developers Warhorse seem to feel their story as a business matches that of its rags-to-rapiers hero, citing their growth from a small studio of 11 people to a big company of 250 employees. It other words, the game will probably be shinier.</p>
<p>We can also consider the first game. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-delayed-2017">also delayed</a>, just so you know. And it turned out to be a mostly okay mix of interesting features and grounded questing. Reading was a skill you had to learn. You could save your game by getting mildly drunk. And NPC guards would stop you to check your pockets if you were consistently misbehaving. </p>
<p>"Warhorse's debut RPG shines brightest when the quest design really digs into the peculiarities of its era, not quite cutting you adrift, but certainly not holding your hand," said Edwin in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">our review</a>. But he also pointed out some "tedious macho elements" and a loose bugginess that plagued the game. Concerning the emphasis on historical accuracy which the game strove for, lead developer Daniel Vávra was criticised for fuelling gamergate with <a href="https://x.com/danielvavra/status/569686445344079872?lang=en">some questionable remarks</a>, and later <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/statement-by-daniel-v%C3%A1vra-and-martin-kl%C3%ADma-regarding-racism-nazism-accusations-gamestar-de.17259/">apologised for that</a>. This somewhat soured the game's reception in many quarters.</p>
<p>We'll know more about the sequel as the days pass until its release, whether it's on James' itinerary or not.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reliable leaker NateDrake has claimed that Final Fantasy 16 is arriving for Xbox soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NateDrake was asked on ResetEra (via <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/08/15/rumor-final-fantasy-16-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) whether any more games were coming to Xbox and if a Final Fantasy 16 release is possible. NateDrake replied that Final Fantasy 16 on Xbox “is going to happen. Just waiting for Square to announce it”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that this claim about Final Fantasy 16 being released on Xbox comes just a week after rumours about the game coming to PC surfaced. Last week, keen-eyed Reddit users spotted a Game Ready profile for Final Fantasy 16 in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidias-latest-driver-includes-a-game-ready-profile-for-final-fantasy-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia’s latest driver</a>, suggesting an announcement for a potential PC release could be on the horizon. We might receive more clarity on this at Gamescom 2024. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-final-fantasy-16">About Final Fantasy 16</h2>



<p>Final Fantasy 16 is the newest standalone entry in the long-standing Square Enix series, exclusive to PlayStation 5. The game is set in Valisthea, a world filled with Mothercrystals that provide aether fuel to help the population survive. However, the light from the Mothercrystals is slowly fading, and the Blight is gradually destroying everything in its path.</p>



<p>You play Clive Rosfield, First Shield of Rosaria, in the game. Your mission is to free humankind from their fate and use Eikonic powers as the Dominant to defeat all enemies that come your way. Eikons are the most powerful and deadly creatures in Valisthea, and you have to harness their power to overcome them.</p>

But the internet will ever internet, and thanks to some slip-up or other, we have the knowledge just a smidge early. Will I tell you what the actual release date is? Sure. I guess so.</p>

<p>The very purple <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is coming out October 31, according to the wayward ad, which was <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777">caught by Xitter leak-enjoyer Wario64</a>, among others. I've embedded the upcoming release trailer anyway, so you can enjoy that when it finally does land. I haven't seen it yet, so let's see if I can accurately predict what will happen in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>A creature squeals and is upset</li>
<li>A mage crosses their arms haughtily</li>
<li>VFX blasts a bunch of wooden crates to pieces</li>
<li>Varric looks suggestively at the camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Did any of that come true? As you can see, I'm struggling. I lept from the Dragon Age tour bus after the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> pulled the series away from being a world-crossing jaunt and focused on one (I think) fairly uninteresting city. The opening area of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> didn't reinvigorate me. But I know lots of folks follow the trials of these warlocky weirdoes with relish. "Dragon Age II, unfairly maligned in my opinion, is about one city facing external and internal conflict over a long period of time," said Alice B <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dragon-age-inquisition-2">once upon a time</a>. "Inquisition is about a world at war with itself, literally and metaphorically." It also has a fun bit where you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-joy-of-being-the-belle-of-the-ball-in-dragon-age-inquisition">gatecrash a fancy masked ball</a>. </p>
<p>It's been a while since Inquisition came out, so you can be forgiven if you have no idea why elf mage Solas is suddenly doing some dubious portal opening. Luckily, Veilguard will bring you through the story so far, and even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-let-you-bring-over-your-choices-from-inquisition-whether-you-still-have-your-save-or-not">let you stick to your old choices</a>, if you can remember them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/cataclismo-early-access-review-the-most-innovative-indie-of-the-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>How do you make a game stand out in the modern age? Innovative ideas and designs might be the path to longevity, but, if we’re all being honest, a game’s visuals are the initial hook. Cataclismo manages both feats though, with a beautiful, distinctive aesthetic married to an inventive take on tower defence and RTS mechanics. Launched into Early Access last month, Cataclismo is an enigmatic, atmospheric, and even at this point, borderline essential title from the team behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter</a> and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cataclismo - Sandbox Mode Trailer | Base Building RTS/Siege Defense" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nacsUxzSLQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You take on the role of the Lady Iris, leader of the last remnants of humanity. This was once a vibrant world, and remained so when the perlas appeared, giant glowing orbs that carried immense power. Humanity accepted their gifts, but, as with most things, this power came with a price. The world became covered in Mist, its enveloping cloak hiding a malignance that transformed people into foul, thoughtless creatures known as horrors. These grim remnants are attracted to the remaining humans, and so, you must defend against this ongoing threat.</p>


<p>The remaining people reside in Hogar, the last city yet to fall to the Mist. As their leader, Lady Iris commands the steadily growing troops, oversees building, and assists in the city’s defence as well. Unusually, Lady Iris was born with a perla within her, an oddity that allows her to perform Artes. These special actions form the cornerstone of your defense against the monstrous hordes. These abilities can be discovered, upgraded and strengthened as you progress, and likewise you’ll unlock new buildings and structures to help you guard against the horrors as they grow ever more dangerous and greater in number.</p>


<p>Cataclismo is dark. Its landscape leers out of the gloom, black edges teetering against stone and tree alike. It marries well with the bold lines and simple shapes of the people that dwell there, and there’s a comic-like design to each of the different units and the Lady Iris herself. That ties into the cutscenes, which in turn remind you of the more thoughtful artstyle of books like Y: The Last Man or Mike Mignola’s Hellboy. Whichever comparisons or influences are apparent, Art Director David Aguado has absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Controlling your army is reassuringly familiar. Selecting units and deploying them is as simple as it’s ever been, though at the outset they might just be the chattiest group I’ve come across since Warcraft III, acknowledging your every request with a selection of dialogue. While actions are played out in real-time, you can pause the action whenever you like, issuing commands or simply gathering your breath for the next assault. It’s especially important when you’re about to indulge in Cataclimso’s most rewarding aspect: building.</p>
<p>Each settlement you build must be designed to protect the people within. You have to build up your defenses, make them accessible for your troops, and think about the most effective way to fight off your attackers. This means chunky stone walls and parapets thrusting into the air behind your ground troops, as well as walkways and stairs for your ranged units to clamber up.</p>

<p>Hogar’s impressive Solas Gate forms the initial defensive structure, and it stands as the last line of defense against the swarms that come every night, attracted to the people within. Your first major task in the campaign is to build further walls, and you immediately get a sense of the straightforward but powerful building tools that let you quickly create new structures.</p>
<p>The higher your walls, the more strength they have. There’s then a variety of bonuses that can be bestowed on your troops by adding Tactical Pieces to your structure. The team have previously likened the building tools to Lego, and there is a glorious simplicity to the way it all locks together, telling you when something isn’t correctly supported, or making you rethink your approach so that you create a structure using the finite resources at your disposal.</p>
<p>As you try to push back against the horrors, you build new settlements, or reinforce those that have fallen. To do so, you have to build up a working economy, with wood, stone and oxygen forming the central points within it. A Sawmill is the first building you must put down, but you then have to make sure there’s a clear route to your Citadel for it to function. The city-building tools are as well thought out as you’d hope, and the modularity of the walls carries over to each of the buildings, with flat roofs allowing you to continue building further structures on top of them.</p>

<p>The music here is the final, and perhaps most important, layer to Cataclismo’s atmosphere. Synth-led tones grow and pulsate, rising out of the gloom in the same way the visuals do, while plaintive acoustic guitar tells its own story in the quieter moments. These are then juxtaposed with bombastic moments of drama, the two key instruments joining together to create something powerful and moving.</p>
<p>Cataclismo is tough. You have to get used to the rhythm of pausing the game to build, organise your troops and prepare, before letting the timer wind down to the evening and a fresh wave of horrors. It’s well worth persevering though, and with Iris’ ability to rewind time, you can return to several set points through each level, allowing you to correct where you’ve gone wrong.</p>
<p>This is all in the stellar campaign, with hours of gameplay to be found here alone. The addition of skirmish mode, where you can play across hand-crafted maps, including your own, and an endless mode that gives you a steady stream of procedurally generated maps means that Cataclismo is capable of taking all your gaming time, and then probably a bit more. I didn’t go to sleep until 1AM last night, and it is definitely Cataclismo’s fault.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for this year’s most innovative, genre-splicing indie, then Cataclismo has set a standard that looks unlikely to be beaten.</p>

		<p>EA and BioWare will reveal the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> release date later today, with an announcement trailer set to go live at 5PM BST, but the game’s 31st October 2024 launch has already leaked by way of a video advertisement – picked up by the ever-watchful <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777">Wario64</a>.</p>
<p>So…. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 31st October.</p>

<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">previously known as Dragon Age 4 and then as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – is the long-awaited return of one of BioWare’s most popular RPG series.</p>
<p>The studio has ramped up the reveals and announcements in the last few months, starting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-reveal-is-here/">a big gameplay trailer</a> during Summer Game Fest, which showcased the earliest part of the game with our player character, Rook, and series mainstay Varric delving into the very pretty, but seedy city of Minrathous on the hunt for Solas. This also introduced a few other companions, as they raced against time to stop&nbsp;Solas from conducting a ritual that’s breaking the barrier between world, the Veil, which is allowing demons to enter this world.</p>

<p>At the end of July, BioWare then revealed the full cast list of voice actors for all the companions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rook </strong>voiced be&nbsp;Erika Ishii&nbsp;(Apex Legends, Destiny 2),&nbsp;Jeff Berg&nbsp;(Battlefield 1, NCIS),&nbsp;Bryony Corrigan&nbsp;(Baldur’s Gate 3, Good Omens) and&nbsp;Alex Jordan&nbsp;(Cyberpunk 2077, The Amazing World of Gumball).</li>
<li><strong>Harding the Dwarven Scout</strong> voiced by Ali Hillis (Mass Effect 3, Naruto)</li>
<li><strong>Davrin the Grey Warden&nbsp;</strong>voiced by Ike Amadi (Mass Effect 3, Halo 5: Guardians, Insomniac’s Spider-Man)</li>
<li><strong>Bellara the Veil Jumper </strong>voiced by Jee Young Han (Perry Mason, Unprisoned)</li>
<li><strong>Neve the Shadow Dragons rebel </strong>voiced by Jessica Clark (True Blood, Pocket Listing)</li>
<li><strong>Taash the Dragon Hunter </strong>voiced by Jin Maley (Star Trek: Picard, Silicon Valley)</li>
<li><strong>Emmrich the Necromancer </strong>voiced by Nick Boraine (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Black Sails)</li>
<li><strong>Manfred, Emmrich’s skeletal assistant</strong>, voiced by Matthew Mercer&nbsp;(Critical Role, Fallout 4).</li>
<li><strong>Lucanis the Assassin </strong>voiced by&nbsp;Zach Mendez (Horizon Forbidden West, Married Alive)</li>
</ul>

Over here. Do you know a cheeky sort with a passion for unbridled mayhem and adorable two-dimensional llamas? Alright then.

Their enemies will do the same. Those actions will then play out simultaneously before the cycle begins again. It's a system of action, consequence, and reaction that becomes unpredictable thanks to the inclusion of anarchic abilities and items that can sometimes defy the flow of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Choices made throughout your adventure will also raise the stakes. Each playable character has a guilt level. As that increases, the emotional strain will physically manifest as hostile spirits that hunt players on the battlefield. These supernatural foes don't subscribe to the laws of physics and can pursue players even when time has paused. The more inner demons you collect, the more difficult your skirmishes will become. Heavy stuff. But those llamas should take the edge off.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Searching for the sweet spot between control and carnage">Searching for the sweet spot between control and carnage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sitting down with Game Developer ahead of launch to unpack </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arco's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> combat system, Nowotniak, Uribe, and Garcia said they wanted to create a system that felt truly "dynamic." They felt combat in other action titles often relies on rapid button presses or reflexes, which might be fun for those who can master that specific craft—but can also feel restrictive. Conversely, bread-and-butter turn-based combat was too sedate. The team didn't want players to be forced to watch turns unfold rather than being an active participant. So, they combined the two.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That core concept didn't fluctuate too much during development, but there was still plenty of room for fine-tuning. "The first time we [implemented combat], it was very slow," says Nowotniak. "We made you control the exact movement in the turn phase. You had to drag the mouse around to draw a line you would follow. A lot of controls were very slow and exact, while later, we realized you could just click somewhere to [queue an action]. We didn't need to micromanage every little thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another challenge that threatened to derail proceedings was the failed inclusion of a combat time bar. The team canceled a side quest that would have incorporated a timeline that told players what would happen during each turn, asking them to counter those actions. It was, in theory, a twist that turned combat into something more akin to a prophetic puzzle. But it just didn't work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the main problem was we we're trying to implement that while trying to figure out a lot of the combat itself," says Nowotniak. "If we made the combat from the start into what it is now and then tried to add it, it could have worked. But we tried implementing too many features at the same time, and then if one of those didn't work, the other had to change."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nowotniak explains that keeping skirmishes smaller in scale worked better in the long term. That's not to say things won't get hairy. Death will come for players eventually, and that could have been a problem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to make sure that players know there isn't much consequence to dying," says Nowotniak. "It's a linear game with different paths. It's not like a roguelike where you die and get pushed back to the start. [...] We wanted players to try different things and fail—but then try again. Because the combat shines when you play around with it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The consensus was to try and avoid punishing players for experimentation. "It's not turn-based, so I think if players are approaching it in an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> kind of way and studying the situation for 10 minutes, it's not that kind of game," says Uribe. "It's more just 'fuck around and find out.' Make the mistakes, because if you get killed, it'll happen fast."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Uribe says the combat system is fluid in a "chemical" way. There are items and abilities that can chain together to create rampant, unpredictable carnage. The reality is you really </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>have</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to fuck around to find out. Even if that means flirting with your mortality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, there is an item where, if you throw it, it creates a gas cloud. Then if you shoot an arrow through that, it poisons the arrow. Then if it hits an enemy it poisons the enemy," Uribe continues, outlining how those sequences can unfold. "We don't tell you these things, but you might discover [a lot of situations like this]. There are some combinations even we probably haven't discovered. That's where I think the game shines."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are currently "way too many" items, abilities, and possible combinations to list here. So, to encourage experimentation and dissuade those players with a tendency to horde items until the credits roll, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arco</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be generous when it comes to dishing out the contraband. Environmental hazards such as exploding cacti and bear traps have been deployed to tempt players to live a little. The title teases players with the question, 'What if you just did this?' and dares them to find the answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the team mentioned earlier, death will also pass in a flash to avoid creating a vicious cycle of negative reinforcement. "I think the biggest thing you can take away from players is their time," says Nowotniak. "So we tried to minimize the time between [death] and starting again." He says the team even tried to implement an 'undo' button that would essentially allow players to rewind time if they perish, but ultimately, it had to be dropped due to production constraints.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also the hope that players will feel compelled to share their barmpot maneuvers, creating a llama-riding community of chaos merchants who can push each other to greater heights. Experimenting on your own is fun, but devising a system that compels players to record and distribute their unique brand of tomfoolery on the World Wide Web could perhaps deliver another level of success for a group of intrepid indies. Wouldn't that be something?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Warhorse Studios has revealed a delay to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which will now arrive on 11th February 2025.
</p>
<p>
"We aimed for the end of the year and almost made it - almost is not good enough though, so we slipped to 2025," Warhorse's Tobias Stolz-Zwilling said in a video posted to X. 
</p>
<p>
The next week will still be a busy one for the game, though, as it pops up during Gamescom's Opening Night Live show next Tuesday, 20th August, and is then showcased in a 20-minute gameplay reveal video set to go live online the following day. 
</p>
<p>
(Oh, and if you're at Gamescom in Cologne yourself, it's playable on the show floor.)

        <p>This happened to my buddy Eric</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Steam’s seeing a good few sweeping changes of late. They’ve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-now-has-a-trending-free-tab-for-demos-full-free-games-and-free-to-play">recently added a ‘Trending Free’ tab</a> to separate the no money down and no, money down playables. And, as of September, they’re cracking <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836">down on links to other websites</a> in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4326355263805583415">outlined here</a>.</p>
<p>The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!</p>

<p>Historically, Steam has sorted reviews by the number of ‘helpful’ community votes. The (absolutely unexpected, wildly unpredictable, who could have ever foreseen this?) side-effect of this system has meant a lot of “jokes, memes, ascii art and other content that might not be the most helpful for a potential purchaser” being bumped to top billing. Steam love jokes, they’re eager to remind. They’re on the level, and feel that such tomfoolery is “often a lot of fun for existing customers of a game”. But, they say, “it doesn’t always help new players in making informed purchasing decisions.”</p>
<p>Now, user reviews that are “identified as being unhelpful for potential customers, such as one-word reviews, reviews comprised of ASCII art, or reviews that are primarily playful memes and in-jokes, will be sorted behind other reviews on the game’s store page.” The post later clarifies that “identified” here means a combination of user ports, moderation, and “some machine learning algorithms to help scale the human judgment calls.” It’s worth reading the full list of question, but I did find this one interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q. If you've identified a review as unhelpful, why not delete the review?</p>
<p>A. We have found that many players want to express an opinion about the game, but don't always have the words to describe their experience with the game, or aren't interested in writing much. Their indication of whether they would recommend the game is still valuable data, even if they are not able to articulate why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Valve reiterate that you’ll still be able see “humorous, but unhelpful posts,” just less frequently. They also point out that the changes won’t impact the overall review score for a given game - “it is simply changing the order that reviews appear on each store page.”</p>
<p>My main take here is that Valve have conveniently absolved me from needing to have one, since there’s a toggle to decide whether to use the changes or not. My other, actual take is that this sounds broadly good, although I do still wish they’d do something about those aggressive clown emojis, which sort of reinforce the clout-chasing Valve are presumably trying to avoid here, just from the opposite end of the spectrum. The jester reaction’s “once jovial smile is now perma-wrenched into a mocking rictus by anonymous puppeteers intent on using it for assorted acts of wankery,” as I put it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unpacking-the-cursed-digital-object-that-is-steams-clown-reaction-emoji">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare's long-awaited next entry in its fantasy role-playing game series, will launch on 31st October. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to an early version of tonight's release date reveal trailer which has popped up online early. 
</p>
<p>
It's been a long wait for BioWare fans - just a month shy of a full decade since 2014's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> - but finally the next chapter in the saga is only a month and a half away.
</p>
<p>
BioWare will officially date Dragon Age: The Veilguard tonight, in a trailer set to go public at 5pm UK time. From the trailer's title art, this looks to be a longer look - including a glimpse at some custom versions of the game's protagonist Rook - than the short video now circulating.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, BioWare laid out a marketing roadmap as it ramps up to The Veilguard's 31st October release, which will include looks at the game's high-level combat and PC version next week, and a focus on detailing the game's companion the week after. 
</p>
<p>
On 30th August, BioWare will hold a developer Q&amp;A via Discord, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>"Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," Chris Tapsell wrote, coming away impressed from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard first hands-on</a>.</p>
<p>
Check back at 5pm UK time to see what BioWare has in store within the game's official release date trailer, below:

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374">Twitter</a>, Warhorse PR Manager Tobi Stolz-Zwilling explained, “We aimed for the end of the year and… almost made it –&nbsp;almost is not good enough, though, so unfortunately we slipped to 2025. However at least we have a real precise release date now, which is 11th February 2025, the anniversary week of Kingdom Come: Deliverance.”</p>


<p>The announcement comes just days before Gamescome 2024, which will see plenty of significant news for the game. There will be a full 25 minutes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 gameplay showcased during Gamescom 2024, there will be a Collectors Edition reveal, and a drop of previews from press and creators alike.</p>

<p>Announced back in April, Warhorse is following in the footsteps of the original game, but while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a narrative sequel, the intent is that it should still provide a good starting point for newcomers. The game will feature Henry of Skalitz (Tom McKay) as our protagonist once more, still trying to track down those who slaughtered his family and village, but he is also the squire to his liege, Sir Hans (Luke Dale), as they journey through medieval Bohemia in the early 1400s. However, where the first game was focussed more on towns and villages dealing with banditry, the sequel deals with the problems of kings and wars.</p>

<p>This will take players to two locations: the region known as Bohemian Paradise, with lush and vibrant countryside to explore near Trosky Castle, but it surely won’t be long before heading to the major city of Kuttenberg, which rivalled Prague in economic, cultural and political power during this period, thanks to silver mining in the region. In both maps, Warhorse has worked hard to try and capture the colours of medieval bohemia, dispelling the common perception that the time period was simply drab, muddy and squalid.</p>
<p>Through all of this, the intent is still for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to be a classic RPG, with all of the player choice and narrative implications that this brings. Despite being a sequel, Henry is still a character in relatively formative stages, and so you can shape and play as him in different ways. You’ll be able to gear him towards combat prowess, be a bit of a sweet-talker, a thief, scoundrel, and more.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is coming out for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, BioWare <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1823751789453435295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the launch date for Dragon Age: The Veilguard would be revealed later today. However, a leaked video already shared that information; as <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Wario64, the game will launch on Thursday, October 31.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is also opening its pre-orders later today. It is possible that the game will follow the recent trend of allowing pre-orders of high-tier editions to get in early, for example, on Monday, October 28, but we'll have to wait for the official info before we know for sure.</p>
<p>Overall, it's good news for RPG fans after the delays of <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, both now scheduled within a week of each other next February. The other major RPG in the release schedule, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, still <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clings</a> to its Fall 2024 launch window, but that might change soon, leaving the door wide open for BioWare's latest game.</p>
<p>The developer and publisher EA are planning a few weeks of hard-hitting news. According to the freshly published roadmap, next week will be devoted to a high-level combat overview and a PC spotlight. The latter announcement will probably reveal a partnership with one of the three major hardware manufacturers (Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA). The following week will be fully dedicated to companions, while another developer Q&amp;A on the official Discord server has been set for August 30. On September 3, IGN will begin its month-long exclusive coverage, and there will be more press coverage throughout the month.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the fourth mainline installment in the fantasy franchise. It is set around ten years after the events shown in the previous game and its narrative follows directly on that thread. The main character isn't the Inquisitor anymore, but players will encounter the Inquisitor throughout the game.
