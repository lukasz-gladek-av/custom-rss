            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224391/mecha-break-nvidia-ai-npcs-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia ACE, the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23740908/nvidia-ace-demo-voice-ai-npc-game-characters">AI-powered system</a> for giving voices and conversation skills to in-game characters, is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fmecha-break-nvidia-ace-nims-rtx-pc-laptop-games-apps%2F">set to debut</a> in <a href="https://www.mechabreak.com/index/en/#/"><em>Mecha Break</em></a>, a new multiplayer mech battle game coming to PC, Xbox X / S, and PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p><p>In<em> Mecha Break,</em> players can choose from a variety of mechs across categories like assault, melee, and sniper for online matches where they’ll fight both on the ground and in the air. It looks similar to something like the <em>Armored Core</em> series, just without a single-player mode. </p><p>Nvidia writes that players will be able to “interact via natural language with game characters” and that the characters can “see” and identify you or objects around you through your webcam, using GPT-4o. It’ll also use a combination of on-device Nvidia models and cloud-based AI to generate NPCs’ voices. </p><p>In the demonstration above, the player asked an in-game character for details about their mission and mechs, then changed their mech’s paint job by talking to it. The AI NPC’s responses were flatly delivered and bland. Maybe that’s fine when NPCs are just glorified in-game wikis.</p><p>But it might not be ideal for much beyond that. When <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">demoed Nvidia ACE</a> in January, he pointed out that the characters “didn’t feel like real people,” the dialog wasn’t particularly inspiring, and that there were frequent delays before NPCs replied. <em>Mecha Break</em> doesn’t look like it’s any better so far, but we’ll see where things stand when it releases next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Backyard Sports, the iconic video game series known for making kid-friendly sports games, <a href="https://backyardsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is back</a>.</p><p>In a press release, Playground Productions, the company currently holding the rights to the Backyard Sports IP, confirmed it was reviving the series, noting that the franchise is "slated to return in the coming months." Playground Productions also provided the first teaser trailer for Backyard Sports, featuring memorable characters like Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan.</p><p>You can check out the first trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Beyond the confirmation of new Backyard Sports video games, Playground Productions said the series' return will expand its reach to multiple verticals beyond video games, such as film, TV, and merchandise. Playground Productions explained that the revival of Backyard Sports will use "cutting-edge technology and esteemed character IP" to aim to create stories and experiences that will resonate with those who grew up with the series along with the current generation of youth.</p><p>"We're incredibly excited to reintroduce Backyard Sports to a new generation of players," Playground Productions CEO Chris Waters wrote in the press release.

The franchise would eventually include games in other sports, such as basketball, football, hockey, and even skateboarding. Since 2015, however, the series has been dormant. </p><p>While fans of the series have long awaited a new entry for nearly 10 years, chatter saw a spike when NFL star and former Eagles center Jason Kelce revealed on his podcast <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nfl-star-jason-kelce-wants-to-bring-back-backyard-football-and-baseball">last January</a> that he was interested in trying to make a new Backyard Baseball and Backyard Football game. </p><p>A Playground Productions spokesperson confirmed to IGN that Kelce is "isn't directly involved in this relaunch," but acknowledged that Kelce represents an "audience of people that, to this day, fondly remember Backyard Sports as a staple game with iconic characters beloved by many." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

Instead, he plans to make video games of his own, although has yet to announce any concrete plans.</p><p>Amid this, Modern Warfare Remastered’s recent Steam reviews now read “Mostly Negative,” with many recent comments from players calling for Activision to reverse its cease and desist request.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

These include video memory errors with 13th and 14th generation Intel CPUs, a driver issue with AMD GPUs, and frame rate woes, especially with 40-series Nvidia cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Myth: Wukong recently exceeded 2.2 million concurrent players, giving it the second-highest peak player count in the history of Steam, a feat made all the more impressive thanks to its $60 price tag. The game also garnered headlines in recent days thanks to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guidelines-ask-content-creators-not-to-discuss-feminist-propaganda-covid-and-more/1100-6525951/">highly unusual</a> content guidelines given to streamers covering the game, telling them not to discuss COVID or "feminist propaganda" when covering the game.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, critic Richard Wakeling praised the game's impressive visuals and boss fights. "Black Myth: Wukong is an uneven game where the highlights often outnumber the lowlights," he wrote. "Its triumphant boss battles and fast-paced combat make up for the stale moments in between, where bland level design and a scarcity of enemies will have you clamoring for the next face-off with a deadly Yaoguai. I appreciate that it's not just another souls-like in what is now a crowded genre, and the choice to go for a boss gauntlet is unexpected and, honestly, quite refreshing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-update-520<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Creative Assembly have released a new&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's bringing big changes to Dwarfs, Chaos, greenskins, and more besides.</p>
<p>This update follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510">June's Patch 5.1.0</a>, which brought a new Legendary Hero with it, and while there's nothing quite that epic to enjoy this time around, you'll likely appreciate some of the changes, especially if you're a fan of Chaos cults (and who isn't?).</p>
<p>First up, the Dwarfs have received a brand new campaign feature in the form of the Deeps, which allows Dwarfs to expand beneath their Karaks once the Great Gate building has been built. Creative Assembly says this feature is intended to address criticisms that Dwarfs' playstyles are "overly expansionist and aggressive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-dwarfs-deeps.jpg?itok=-ariAOF4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-dwarfs-deeps.jpg?itok=1_yyAVnu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Dwarfs have new features to look forward to in&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Chaos Cults have also been reworked; Cultist agents can now create Cults, and Cults will produce corruption themselves instead of spreading through corruption.</p>
<p>Each Chaos God has an expanded building tree to look forward to, and Cults have had their buildings and effects revamped as well, creating what Creative Assembly calls "unique and interesting gameplay effects".</p>
<p>Across the whole of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>'s campaign, a new Unusual Locations feature has been introduced, which will allow you to "stumble across 20 new unusual locations" that provide "unique and interesting effects". More to the point, however, they also serve as nods for those who know their&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>
<p>If you're a Grand Cathay player, you may also appreciate the new Ivory Road update, which changes the way caravans work; Cathay can dispatch multiple caravans, and caravans will also gain a unit based on where they complete their journey.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-unusual-locations.jpg?itok=rNdl97lB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-unusual-locations.jpg?itok=iCod-VUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>'s new Unusual Locations should give you a chance to indulge in some&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>lore.</figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty more changes besides these, including new greenskin units, new UI improvements, and much more.

            <p>As much as I’m a sucker for the grimmest and darkest of grimdark fantasy settings, the try-hardness of it all can get a bit grating at times. You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heroes-of-the-seven-islands">Heroes Of The Seven Islands</a> feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s fun, it’s colorful, and I can bet it took an absolutely bastard-long time to make, despite a somewhat blasé tone towards its own existence. It’s by Rap2h, who's behind free interactive fiction thingy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2271590/The_Secret_of_Darkwoods/">The Secret of Darkwoods</a>, which 99 people are very positive about. That’s not a big number, but it is nice one. Here’s a trailer for Heroes Of The Seven Islands:</p>

<p>It does look to me, so far at least, like the sort of project that’s got me more interested in discovering the hand-drawn interpretations of various fantasy weirdos than actually fighting them. Still, I’m intrigued by the ‘reputation’ system you can spot in the top right corner of the screen, and how this ends up affecting how people treat your rat druids and bird knights. Here’s the story setup, as told by reputable bard Steam:</p>
<blockquote><p>FURAX THE INDESTRUCTIBLE, fleshless carcass and soulless body, has arrived through an inter-dimensional rift in the colorful, carefree world of Émeyralia, to spread SADNESS and DESPAIR. Nothing seems to be able to stop him: his influence grows daily, many disciples join him and NIGHTMARE CREATURES appear on every continent.</p>
<p>According to the prophecy, only THE ORACLE could defeat him, but he retired centuries ago. To find him, the 7 keys held by the 7 rulers of the 7 islands of the Emerald Archipelago must be gathered. FOUR HEROES, the bravest of the brave, are chosen for this quest. The future of Emeyralia is in their hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game promises hundreds of hand-drawn animations, which is wild, because my hand cramps up if I try to draw a single cat. I had to fill in a form to adopt my actual cat last week, and I think my wrist might still be broken. The combat is “Turn based yet fast”, there’s main and side quests, and it's all scored by “Dungeon Synth Artists”, although no word on the arists in question. You can find the Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010290/Heroes_of_the_Seven_Islands/">here</a>, and it’s due out Q1 next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Are you ready to head to the backyard? <a href="https://backyardsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Playground Productions</a> has officially announced the return of the Backyard Sports franchise for the first time in a decade.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a trailer after days of teases on social media.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Backyard-Sports-Official-Reveal-Trailer.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The first trailer, as you can see above, confirms the return of Backyard Baseball as one of the first titles. It’s also expected that sports like Football, Basketball, and others will get the Backyard Sports treatment.</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly excited to reintroduce&nbsp;<em>Backyard Sports</em>&nbsp;to a new generation of players,” Chris Waters, Playground Productions’ chief product officer, said via Press Release. </p>



<p>“We’re taking great care to preserve the look and feel that made the original games so special while updating them with modern features and gameplay that today’s audience expects. I can’t wait for fans to see what we’re building on the Playground.”</p>



<p>“Backyard Sports&nbsp;is more than just a game; it’s a cherished part of childhood for millions of people,” Playground Productions founder and CEO Lindsay Barnett said.</p>



<p>The series began in 1997 with the original Backyard Baseball. From there, the franchise broke out into other sports like Football, Hockey, Soccer, and Basketball. The last releases game in the form of mobile games in 2015.</p>



<p>More information on the return of Backyard Sports games will be announced “in the coming months”.</p>

That was impressive enough for Game Science, a studio founded by ex-Tencent staff who in the past had primarily worked on mobile games. But <em>Black Myth</em> has also topped every other Steam online sensation of the last few years, including <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Palworld</em>, as well as Valve’s own multiplayer hits <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p>That overwhelming day-one audience appears to be mostly overseas so far, with Simon Carless of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Discover</em> newsletter</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimating</a></span> almost 90 percent of <em>Black Myth</em>’s current players on Steam are from China, followed by 3 percent from the U.S. and 1 percent from Japan. “Probably, China accounts for 80+% of players where with a large game with localization in the region will account for maybe 25-40%m” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1825880703596429525&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1825880703596429525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Michael Douise, head of publishing at <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>maker Larian Studios. “It’s a testament what the region can do to shatter numbers when properly mobilized both regionally and internationally in one big launch.”</p><h2 id="h135576"><a id=""></a>Is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Game Pass?</h2><p>We also still don’t know the breakdown of player numbers on PlayStation 5, where <em>Black Myth</em> is a temporary console exclusive after the Xbox version was delayed. The Microsoft miss echoes last year’s giant <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> launch where a version wasn’t ready for the Game Pass platform until December. Why the wait this time? “We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X/S version to meet our quality standards, so it won’t release simultaneously with the other platforms,” Game Science <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote earlier this year</a></span>. “We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p><p>Some players speculated that was due to a surprise exclusivity deal with Sony, but it seems like the Xbox version, which has to have feature parity on both Xbox Series X and the weaker S, just wasn’t ready. “We’re excited for the launch of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” a Microsoft spokesperson told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windows Central</em></a></span> in June. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</p><p>Given the blockbuster launch thus far, it seems unlikely <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> will be a surprise Game Pass release once it finally hits Xbox unless Microsoft is willing to shell out some series money.

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/20/sonic-x-shadow-generations-interview-shadow-the-hedgehogs-new-doom-powers-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, PlayStation shared an interview revealing fresh details on Shadow’s Doom Powers coming to Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>



<p>During the interview, Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka said “the Doom Powers play an essential role in Shadow’s journey and development.” They emphasized its flexibility, giving Shadow “new ways to attack enemies and traverse the world” with platforming and more. </p>



<p>Iizuka also mentioned that “the Doom Powers draw energy from Black Doom, so that was taken into consideration in the design of all the Doom Powers.” Earlier this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-new-images-tease-black-doom-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some new images</a> revealed the modern render of the iconic villain Black Doom. </p>



<p>The blog accompanied a new trailer today, which showcases Shadow’s anticipated Doom Powers in action.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer breaks down key abilities including Doom Spears and Doom Blast, which offer new ways for players to attack with Shadow. </p>



<p>Doom Morph, Doom Wing, and Doom Surf are all traversal techniques, allowing shadow to interact with environments, fly, and cross water with ease.</p>



<p>In July 2024, Takashi Iizuka also mentioned a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rpg-sega-takashi-iizuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential Sonic RPG</a>. Though he said such a project is “just a dream right now,” they appeared to express serious interest.</p>



<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations launches on October 25, 2024. It will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and current or last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is taking the world by storm on launch day, beating out records left and right to become one of the most-played games on Steam on day one. It’s honestly impressive, and after playing the game for hours, I fully understand why. It’s phenomenal but certainly more challenging than many were led to believe. Here’s what you need to know before starting Black Myth: Wukong!</p>



<h2 id="h-tips-before-starting-black-myth-wukong">Tips Before Starting Black Myth: Wukong</h2>



<p>We’ve compiled a handful of tips, and it’s sure to grow as I dive into the game more today, that should help you gain a foothold in Black Myth: Wukong. Here’s how to get the best start and beat your opponents as The Destined One!</p>



<h2 id="h-harvest-everything">Harvest Everything!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s start with one of the most essential tips I can offer new players: harvest everything you see. As you explore each zone, you’ll stumble upon countless harvestable resources. These vary in type. You’ll acquire Aged Ginseng, Purple Lingzhi, Gentian, Jade Lotus, and many others. They’re all necessary to craft medicine, which can heal you, remove various effects, such as poison or fire damage, boost your damage output, and even increase your damage resistance.</p>



<p>Trust me when I tell you that you’ll want a few medicinal items on hand to defeat the game’s many bosses!</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-world-around-you">Explore the World Around You</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong isn’t an open-world game but is still relatively large. Every zone I’ve explored so far includes numerous pathways, multiple optional bosses, and countless weak and powerful enemies that provide you with Will upon besting them in combat. </p>



<p>Like in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-steam-deck-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>, there’s no shame in farming regular mobs before tackling a boss. You can quickly gain a level or two before each boss fight by clearing the entire zone. If you want to farm, let the last enemy kill you and repeat the process. </p>



<p>But more importantly, you’ll find secret routes, treasure chests, harvestable resources, and optional secret bosses that reward you with items and Will necessary to push further into the story.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-fear-dying">Don’t Fear Dying</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it certainly borrows from the Soulslike genre, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t technically a Soulslike. It’s still challenging, and there are still many bosses to challenge; there’s no penalty for dying. Should you perish in combat, you’ll respawn at the last Shrine you visited and then go about your day. </p>



<p>That’s right; when you die in Black Myth: Wukong, you don’t drop your Will. You keep everything in your inventory, and the only downside is now you must traverse the zone once more and clear its enemies out of your way. You lose time and nothing else.</p>



<h2 id="h-visit-shrines-often">Visit Shrines Often</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Every Shrine you encounter is a checkpoint. Should you die in combat, you’ll respawn at the last Shrine. But there’s more to these offering points than meets the eye. Every Shrine allows you to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rest</strong>: Replenish your resources, including health and stamina, but all regular enemies respawn (not bosses!).</li>



<li><strong>Travel</strong>: You can travel fast from one Shrine to another, which makes farming Will easier.</li>



<li><strong>Self</strong>–<strong>Advance</strong>: You can choose which spells you’ll wield and respec your skill points.</li>



<li><strong>Craft</strong>: Create weapons and armor using materials you’ve gathered in the world.</li>



<li><strong>Brew</strong>: Craft drinks to aid you in combat.</li>



<li><strong>Store</strong>: Purchase and sell items.</li>



<li><strong>Make Medicines</strong>: Create consumable medicinal items to aid you in combat.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, don’t be afraid to buy items from the Store. It’s a helpful way to gain aid items that allow you to deal additional damage or take more damage from enemies. But also, the Store will periodically refresh with new items, so check back frequently!</p>







<h2 id="h-defeat-bosses-to-gain-spirits">Defeat Bosses to Gain Spirits</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you stumble upon bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, you have a choice. Unless they’re a story boss, you can walk away and find a different path to your objective or fight. It’s up to you. But I recommend you fight every boss you can, as they’ll reward you with Will, occasionally valuable items, and Spirits. You want to acquire as many Spirits in Black Myth: Wukong as possible.</p>



<p>As you unlock Spirits, you’ll unlock that boss’ attack. It expands your arsenal of combat moves, allowing you to mix up playstyles and deal additional damage to enemies. But more importantly, Spirits grant you passive buffs that alter crucial elements of combat. For instance, some Spirits work like a Bloodied build in Fallout 76, allowing you to deal more damage when at low health.</p>



<p>But if you find that you cannot defeat a boss, you can use the game’s fast travel system to return to an area at any point in the game to challenge them once you’re stronger!</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-your-armor-wisely">Consider Your Armor Wisely</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>To aid you in combat, you will inevitably unlock the ability to craft armor. When you visit a Shrine, you’ll see the new choice in the menu, and by now, you should have the necessary resources to craft most of the first armor set: Pilgrim’s.</p>



<p>This is one of the key reasons why you should harvest everything! Every armor set in the game offers a unique buff to your stats and abilities. Take the Pilgrim’s set, for example. When you equip two pieces, your Sprint speed moderately increases. With four pieces equipped, as you Sprint, you gain a damage buff that stacks up to 10 times. It’s incredibly potent when used appropriately.</p>



<p>But as you progress through the game, you will unlock additional armor sets that buff damage, increase defense, and other boons that affect your play style. Find the right set for you, and the rest of the game becomes relatively easier!</p>

<p>The new update, however, has ushered in a rush of new and returning players, upping its concurrent peak to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/594650/charts/?__cf_chl_tk=FZ5GXDFLVTgu85Z4FUkRu4.ml_HRXNG1m_bHXKsmOf0-1724142110-0.0.1.1-8020">60,124 players</a>.</p>
<p>You'd think this would be good news for the player base, but that aforementioned UI update has actually seen the game's hitherto "mostly positive" Steam review score tumble to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>"Hunt 1896 is an unbearable garbage. All the bugs in game make in-game experience completely unsatisfying," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080789007/recommended/594650/">said</a> one unhappy player who has clocked up over 500 playing it.</p>
<p>"Also the new UI... whoever made it should be deprived from ever developing video games. I've played 500+ hours and enjoyed this game, but after such a spit into players' faces, Crytek deserves only bad reviews."</p>
<p>"Y'all chill out about the UI," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023192091/recommended/594650/">suggested</a> one less aggravated player. "New players are coming to the game [right now], and the first thing they're seeing is 'Mostly Negative' reviews. The dev's gon' fix it."</p>
<p>"The bad steam reviews are coming from people who don't realise the UI was always a slog since 2019," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/marcosvolta/recommended/594650/">added</a> another.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-hunt-showdown-1896-pops-up-on-the-esrb-website">Hunt: Showdown 1896 popped up on the ESRB website last month</a>, although, at the time, we weren't sure if this was a full sequel or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">eagerly-anticipated update</a> big enough to necessitate a new rating. Turns out it was the latter.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The brand-new aerobatic open-world survival RPG is available to try out for those who are at Gamescom. However, if you aren't, don't fret. Fera: The Sundered Tribes just got an official early access date. This title is made by Massive Damage, the studio that made games like Halcyon 6 and Star Renegades. Their highly anticipated title, Fera: The Sundered Tribes, now officially has an Early Access date.</p>
<p>This title was first announced last year during IGN's post-show for <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-company-to-return-to-gamescom-2023-company-registrations-up-10-compared-to-last-year/">Gamescom's Opening Night Live</a>. Fera: The Sundered Tribes will be available in Early Access for PC on Steam as of September 17, 2024.</p>
<p>The game has a high social media following, with plenty of people expressing their excitement for the gameplay. Players will soar through the skies, searching for behemoth beasts in vibrant, lush landscapes. The game includes elements of hunting and harvesting, aerial combat, and the capability to participate in co-op gameplay. In addition to these, people can also build their village and work to lead their own tribe.</p>
<p>Combining these elements results in a stunning post-apocalyptic fantasy world as players grapple and soar through stunning vistas to fight colossal creatures to protect and provide for your growing colony and the inhabitants.</p>
<p>"While it's daunting for us as an indie studio to take on a game genre inhabited by behemoth studios with massive budgets, we're thrilled to see our Tiktok videos going viral and flooded by players excited by the concept of 'monster hunting with wingsuits' and eager to get their hands on Fera," says Ken Soto, CEO and co-founder of Massive Damage, Inc.</p>
<p>With the Early Access of Fera: The Sundered Tribes, there is a huge open world for players to explore, with up to four players able to join the game.&nbsp; There are over ten monster species for you to hunt in-game and four distinct weapon classes to give you the opportunity for variety and playing how you want.</p>
<p>This game was featured at the Summer Games Fest Play Days and was designated as one of the GDC "Best in Play" winners. For those who want to purchase the Early Access of Fera: The Sundered Tribes, you can purchase it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2469200/Fera_The_Sundered_Tribes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam for $29.99</a>, with the game being fully released sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>When it is fully released, the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, with more platforms to follow after the release.</p>

The QuadCast 2 and QuadCast 2 S now include a streamlined multifunction control dial and welcome upgrades to their recording quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-quadcast-s-usb-microphone?variant=41031692058781">original versions</a> of the HyperX QuadCast mics delivered a lot of functionality at a sub-$200 price point, including multiple pickup patterns and programmable LED lighting. But recording quality maxed out at 16-bit/48kHz. The new QuadCast 2 boosts recording quality up to 24-bit/96 kHz, while the QuadCast 2 S goes even higher, maxing out at 32-bit/192kHz.</p><p>The new versions are still priced under $200, although each has received a price bump. The QuadCast 2 is now $149.99 instead of $139.99, while the QuadCast 2 S is $199.99, up from $159.99.</p><div><figcaption><em>The QuadCast 2 is still limited to just red LEDs that turn off when the mic is muted.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HyperX</cite></p></div><p>Both mics now feature USB-C ports (the original QuadCast was microUSB), and while the previous versions featured separate knobs for changing pickup patterns and adjusting gain, the QuadCast 2 and QuadCast 2 S have a single multifunction dial on the front that handles “gain adjustment, volume control, mic monitoring, and polar pattern selection.”</p><p>HyperX has also redesigned the shock mounts on the new models, making the microphones easier to remove without having to unscrew or disassemble anything.</p><p>The new mics carry over the LED lighting of their predecessors. The QuadCast 2 is still limited to red LEDs that turn off when the mic is muted, while the QuadCast 2 S features over 100 multicolor addressable LEDs that can be controlled using HyperX’s Ngenuity desktop software to match a gaming room’s aesthetic.</p><p>The QuadCast S is due to become available today, but the more capable QuadCast S 2 is expected to be released sometime in November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Placing points in these will be vital to your success in the game, as they provide very helpful boons. And while the order in which you level them should ultimately be dependent on your playstyle, we’ve compiled a list of skills we think most players will want to invest in early, if you’re looking to get the most out of the early hours of the game.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h133409"><a id=""></a><strong>Robust Constitution</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Survival</strong></p><p>Robust Constitution increases your maximum health by a moderate amount for every point you invest in it. We’d recommend pumping at least three of your early Spark Points into this skill. Some of the early fights can be challenging as you’re getting to grips with the game’s mechanics, and having that extra health can make a huge difference to your survivability when you miss a dodge.</p><h2 id="h133410"><a id=""></a><strong>Swift Engage</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Martial Arts</strong></p><p>Swift Engage is an incredible skill to invest in right away, because it increases the engaging distance of your light attack, which is most often the manner in which you’ll begin attacking a foe. Without this skill, your light attack will essentially keep you locked in place, requiring you to manually move to an enemy to make contact. With two Spark Points invested, however, you’ll be able to automatically close pretty significant gaps between you and the enemy by just tapping your light attack button.</p><figure id="" data-id="fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-recommend-id="image://fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-recommend-id="image://fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h133411"><a id=""></a><strong>Simian Agility</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>Each point in Simian Agility reduces the stamina cost of dodging by a bit, letting you more efficiently move around a battlefield. During the early part of the game, you’ll still be learning how much stamina you need to perform certain actions, so having a bit more to work with is never a bad thing. More importantly, though, investment in this skill opens up some extremely helpful additional skills in the Stamina tree.</p><h2 id="h133412"><a id=""></a><strong>Deft Evasion</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>After purchasing Simian Agility, you’ll have access to Deft Evasion. This is one of the best skills you can pick up early on, as it will increase the distance of your initial dodge. This makes a massive difference when enemies (bosses, especially) have large, sweeping attacks that require you to give a wide berth.</p><h2 id="h133413"><a id=""></a><strong>Composure</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>If you’ve purchased Simian Agility and Deft Evasion, you’re half of the way to Composure. You’ll just need to invest one point each in Endurance and Everlasting Vigor to access it.</p><p>We’d recommend you go that route, as this skill will allow you to keep a combo going even after you dodge. Since combos are a vital part of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s combat, this will vastly improve your efficiency when facing off against foes. Simply dodge out of the way of your enemy’s attack, then immediately continue wailing away with the combo you started.</p><p>With these skills purchased, you’ll be ready to begin spending points in your Stances trees and beyond to really hone in on your personal playstyle. We’re wishing you the best of luck out there!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/16f2c846-9920-48c4-9e09-06913ee254c5/starbreeze-interim-report-q2-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly interim report</a>, Starbreeze offered up more details on its upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons title, including the current state of development. </p>



<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-appoints-mats-juhl-as-new-interim-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed Mats Juhl</a> as its new interim CEO in May 2024. Today, Juhl issued new comments about the D&amp;D game currently titled Project Baxter. </p>



<p>Juhl said that Project Baxter is now in full production, and that it is “growing as planned” and “continues at full speed.” </p>



<p>They also confirmed plans to consider new partnerships on the game. Juhl stated that although Starbreeze will publish the game “our ambition is to enter into partnerships where this is beneficial for the game and Starbreeze.” </p>



<p>Juhl clarified these partnerships could reinforce “marketing, physical distribution or other purposes that increase both the quality and potential of the project, whilst balancing the risk for Starbreeze.”</p>



<ol start="2026"></ol>



<figure></figure>







<p>The new report also elaborated on the timing for potential partnerships. Juhl says “Project Baxter will enter a phase in the fall where we will be more proactive in searching for and holding discussions with suitable partners.” </p>



<p>In today’s quarterly report, Juhl also reiterated Project Baxter’s 2026 release window. Starbreeze confirmed that when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-developer-is-making-a-dungeons-and-dragons-live-service-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> the title in December 2023. </p>
