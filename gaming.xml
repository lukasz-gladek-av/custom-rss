<p>Gray Zone Warfare hit the open market in early access back in April and has been turning heads ever since. With a fresh approach to the tactical FPS genre that fuses it with extraction shooter elements, ‘GZW’ was able to sell almost one million copies in just a few weeks.</p>



<p>Recently, the development team at MADFINGER released a lengthy roadmap that details the most major changes coming up to 2027.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-road-ahead">Long Road Ahead</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare is a slow burner, that much is certain. It’s not a flash in the pan or a ‘built-in-a-day’ kind of project, and it certainly has legs and the dedication of a studio ready to unravel the production over several years.</p>



<p>I recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sat down with the MADFINGER team</a>, including the studio’s CEO, at Gamescom, getting an exclusive look at some of the upcoming content.</p>



<p>Now, the squad has released one of the most ambitious roadmaps I’ve ever seen, covering updates through 2027 and up to the 1.0 release of the game:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It all begins with Night Ops, which drops in a few weeks. It’s the most major update MADFINGER has applied to Gray Zone Warfare thus far, and it’ll bring a day/night cycle to the game that completely changes the playing field.</p>



<p>Next year, Dark Revelations will surface, expanding the game’s story and lore. From there, the team will broaden GZW’s horizons with Elite Operator (Fall 2025), Battle Forge (Spring 2026), Shadow Strike (Fall 2026), and Rising Tensions (Spring 2027).</p>



<p>While these updates are being prepped, improvements and amendments will be made to the game to keep things fresh and smooth for both the new players and those who already consider themselves veterans of Lamang, the massive, open-world map that’s modelled on countries like Laos.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been given a date, but the 1.0 release of Gray Zone Warfare has been teased with the title ‘Ground Zero’. We all know that <strong>something </strong>happened at the core of the map, introducing an impassable area thick with radiation, but we don’t know what it is.</p>



<p>Colour me excited.</p>

                <p>With Sony announcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> earlier this week, a lot of attention has now shifted towards how the improved power of the console might be used to enhance both games on the market, and those that might launch soon. As one of the largest games on the horizon, it's unsurprising that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> has been included in the discussion, particularly around its potential to run at 60 frames per second.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that even with the additional GPU power of the PS5 Pro, this might not be possible. That's according to Richard Leadbetter, editor at renowned games and tech analysis outlet <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>. Echoing statements he made during the initial reveal of Grand Theft Auto VI, Leadbetter says that the limiting factor when it comes to running games like GTA VI at higher framerates is the CPU, and not the GPU. And since the PS5 Pro shares the same CPU as the less-powerful base PS5, it's unlikely that Sony's new console will offer up much of an improvement.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>"Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps (or lower!)," Leadbetter explained to <a href="https://za.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/200624/feature/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "The PS5 Pro uses the same CPU as the PS5 and it would be extremely challenging to hit 60fps if the base PS5 version is targeting 30fps. This isn't a GPU problem, it's a CPU problem."</p><p>If you've been playing Rockstar's games on console exclusively, none of this should be too surprising. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> launched on Xbox One and PS4 in 2013, and was confined to a 30fps limit even after the launch of the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. This only changed relatively recently, with the game being patched to support 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X in 2022. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, another game that initially launched on the previous generation of consoles, is still locked to 30fps on current-generation hardware.</p><p>Sony revealed the PS5 Pro as an answer to customers that tired from having to choose between fidelity and performance modes in games. The console was pitched with the idea of being able to deliver image quality equal to (or better than) games on fidelity or quality modes, but with the smoothness of 60 frames per second. This doesn't mean that the option between performance modes will disappear entirely, and it's plausible that bespoke 30fps modes could return as developers attempt to use the additional resources available to enhance visual fidelity even further at the expense of framerates.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is still in active development, and so nothing can be said for certain about regarding what the Rockstar might be targeting as a baseline for performance. But given the route the studio has historically taken, coupled with the reasoning behind why such an improvement might be possible on the PS5 Pro, it would seem optimistic to think otherwise. Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to launch in 2025, with no exact release date yet announced. The PS5 Pro launches on November 7th, starting at $699.</p>

            <p>There seem to be an infinite number of video game showcase streams these days, each one promising to be full of exciting indie games. Whatever my feelings about the entertainment value of these streams, I can't deny I watch all of them, or that they introduce me to games I might have otherwise missed.
</p>
<p>Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

<p>Thunderful are best known for the SteamWorld games, while Secret Mode published Still Wakes The Deep and A Little To The Left and Kepler are the folks behind the recent Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn and Cat Quest 3 and the upcoming Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Other publishers with games in the showcase include Fireshine Games, Yogscast Games, Miju Games and The Arcade Crew, at least some of which I've heard of.
</p>
<p>The show will be hosted by the YouTubers and Twitch streamers ESO Danny, Dexbonus and Wanderbots, if those names mean anything to you. Dexbonus is the only streamer I have ever watched regularly, which means I get to feel marginally less out of touch than normal.
</p>
<p>I find most showcase streams blur together into a grey goo of badly scripted trailer intros, and that I can't remember most of the games featured minutes after the stream ends. I will remember one or two games, however, and anytime I've spoken to a developer about the efficacy of such streams, they've all pointed to spikes in Steam Wishlist numbers after being included. That means I should probably put my rain away and just watch the parade.
</p>
<p>The Convergence games showcase will be streamed on September 26th at 12pm PST/8pm BST via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@convergence_gs">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Convergence_GS">Twitch</a>, and the other usual places.

<p>Drama Studios, the developers behind the hyper-realistic first-person shooter Unrecord has announced that it’s raised $2.5 million in seed funding. </p>



<p>The French studio says that money will be used to improve its “core development team”. With a larger team, the company will work to bring the game to a “solid demo state” for players to experience. </p>

<iframe title="UNRECORD Trailer 4K (New Photorealistic Body Cam Game 2024)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/otu_iFTivQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unrecord debuted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tactical-shooter-unrecorded-offers-unprecedented-fps-immersion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to viral success</a> when people first saw a gameplay trailer that looked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-unrecord-gameplay-footage-fake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a little too realistic</a> to be a game. Since then, the team at Drama has been working on the game while securing funding.</p>



<p>As far as the funding goes, most comes from The Games Fund. Despite getting interest from other publishers, the studio went with the VC due to their “aligned values and vision for the games industry”. </p>



<p>Drama will look for publishing and “strategic partnership opportunities” are the game gets to the aforementioned demo state.</p>



<p>Unrecord is a tactical shooter that plays out from the perspective of an officer’s body camera.</p>



<p>“The storyline in Unrecord can be compared to a detective novel or a thriller,” Drama Studios says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2381520/Unrecord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the game’s Steam page</a>. “The player will have to investigate several criminal cases and confront a diverse cast of characters.”</p>

The Flappy Bird Foundation group has acquired the rights to both the official Flappy Bird trademark and the rights to Piou Piou vs. Cactus, the mobile game upon which Flappy Bird's titular character is based.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FLAPPY BIRD IS BACK!</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"It's been a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here, but we're so excited to finally begin sharing Flappy Bird once again with the world," a spokesperson for the Flappy Bird Foundation said of the game's upcoming reboot.</p><p dir="ltr">The Flappy Bird Foundation says that "the return of the viral game will debut in Fall 2024," but added, "Launches on iOS and Google Play are planned for 2025." GameSpot has reached out to the Flappy Bird Foundation for clarification, but it seems that players will get a taste of the game sometime near the end of 2024, before the game officially launches on browsers and mobile devices in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Flappy Bird will return to a variety of platforms, including web browsers and new dedicated apps planned in 2025 for iOS and Android, with other platforms to be announced," read a press release from the Flappy Bird Foundation, suggesting players may even see a console launch at some point.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Flappy Bird launched in May 2013 for iOS and January 2014 for Android, but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-flappy-bird/1100-6417647/" data-ref-id="1100-6417647">removed from both Google Play and the App Store</a> on February 10, 2014, after its creator, Vietnamese game developer Dong Nguyen, became overwhelmed by the popularity of the game--and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" rel="nofollow ">its addictive nature</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432095426854912000" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I can call 'Flappy Bird' is a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it.</p>  — Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/432095426854912000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2014</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Given the fact that the fan-founded Flappy Bird Foundation has acquired the rights to the game, one would think that Nguyen might have made a bit of money from the sale, but that doesn't appear to be the case. According to <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">court documents</a>, it seems that <a href="https://x.com/samnchiet/status/1834246569857634352" rel="nofollow ">the trademark for Flappy Bird was considered abandoned</a>, which may have allowed the creators of the reboot to get their hands on the IP for free, though the details remain unclear. GameSpot has reached out to the Flappy Bird foundation for comments regarding the acquisition of the trademark.</p><p dir="ltr">Nguyen has yet to make a statement on the game's 2025 revival, but Michael Roberts--the chief creative behind the return of the game--seems ecstatic to be helming the return of the game, which includes a number of new gameplay features, like new game modes, characters, progression, and "massive multiplayer challenges for the world to flap together."</p><p dir="ltr">"We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come," Roberts said of the game's return. "We have big plans for our little Bird!"</p>

This adorable and vibrant title provides everything above in buckets, and it manages to offer up an enjoyable platformer-meets-<em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> hybrid in the process.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re wondering how long it takes to beat this delightful delivery romp, spoiler alert: Not very long. However, it should be noted that <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is currently in early access, and has a lot of additional free content planned, as developer Chibig continues to work on it, so that’s almost certain to change (at least somewhat) over time. For now, though, what you can expect from the game.</p><h2 id="h4870"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>?</h2><p>If your goal is to simply see the credits roll in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> in its early access form, without tracking down collectibles or completing optional deliveries, it’s likely to take you a brisk <strong>three to four hours</strong>.</p><p>Doing everything currently available in the game won’t add a <em>huge </em>amount of time, either, as the optional content in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is currently somewhat limited. Those aforementioned collectibles and optional deliveries will only add an extra hour or two for most.</p><h2 id="h4871"><a id=""></a>What’s on the way for <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-recommend-id="image://9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chibig / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-recommend-id="image://9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Developer Chibig has plans for a lot more content over the coming months, so it’s clear the team is planning to beef things up in the long term. In 2024, Chibig has at least two free updates planned, and there’s likely to be even more well beyond that.</p><p>An October update will include two new mini-games: Churro Express, and Kitties, which will task Mika with delivering churros and rescuing some kittens, respectively. Although hopefully not at the same time. Imagine the mess in the fur. Completing these will grant in-game rewards, so it should provide a good reason to dive back in.</p><p>Meanwhile, a December update will include a fishing mini-game and the introduction of dungeons for Mika to explore. There’s not a lot of information about these available at this time, but they sound like exciting additions to the game that should increase playtime by a reasonable amount.</p><p>As of right now, however, there’s not a lot of meat on the bones of this cutesy platforming adventure, but it’s clear there’s plenty to come. In the meantime, if you’re just looking for a quick dopamine hit, <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> might be just what you need.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s big PlayStation-celebrating platformer is out now on PlayStation 5 and despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">some glaring omissions</a></span>, it’s a delightful game worth playing. It’s especially rewarding if you’re a long-time PlayStation fan who has played a lot of the company’s games over the past 30 years.</p><p>If your experience with PlayStation is a little spotty, you might not recognize all the cameos and references scattered throughout its levels. So, if you’re looking to brush up on some of the lesser-known Sony games after seeing these characters in <em>Astro Bot</em>, here are a few recommendations that you can play on your PS5 right now.</p></div></div><div><p>Back in 2015, Media Molecule completely retooled <em>Tearaway</em>, an incredible Vita-exclusive platformer based entirely around the handheld’s built-in tech, to make it work on a PlayStation 4 controller. <em>Tearaway </em>was an underappreciated gem, as it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-vita-the-kotaku-review-5884517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-vita-the-kotaku-review-5884517">on a handheld console that only a few million people bought</a></span>, so it made sense for Sony to port it to the PS4. Media Molecule went the extra mile with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01607_00-TEARAWAYUNFOLDED&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01607_00-TEARAWAYUNFOLDED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tearaway Unfolded</em></a></span> and remade most of it to accommodate the DualShock 4, such as pressing the touchpad causing platforms to bounce and give you some extra air time or the light bar illuminating dark areas. <em>Tearaway Unfolded</em> is a wonderful, joyous game that feels almost like a precursor to <em>Astro Bot</em>. It has a lot of the same design philosophies that make them both fun platformers and a technical showcase for their respective controllers. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of games that deserved a bigger audience than the Vita could offer, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01130_00-GRAVITYRUSHHD000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01130_00-GRAVITYRUSHHD000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gravity Rush</em></a></span> and its sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA03694_00-GRAVITYRUSH20000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA03694_00-GRAVITYRUSH20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gravity Rush 2</em></a></span> are some of the most underrated games from that era. These open-world action games star Kat, a young woman who has the ability to shift gravity, allowing her to “fall” across long distances. She can use the momentum to unleash devastating kicks against her enemies. <em>Gravity Rush </em>can be a bit disorienting, but there’s nothing like using Kat’s powers to send yourself barreling through an environment. Traversal has always been one of the biggest barriers for me in open-world games, because if it’s not fun to move through a space, I don’t care how big it is. <em>Gravity Rush </em>has such a simple, exhilarating answer to this question that it remains an old favorite of mine.</p></div><div><p>You will not get me to write about older PlayStation gems without me writing about <em>Sly Cooper</em>. Sucker Punch’s heist platformers are still some of the breeziest, most innovative mascot platformers to grace a PlayStation console, and yet Sony cannot be bothered to greenlight a fifth one and resolve <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>’s cliffhanger. The original game is available <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA21300_00-SCUS971980000000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA21300_00-SCUS971980000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a PS2 classic</a></span>, but the rest of the games are only playable through streaming and a PlayStation Plus subscription. <em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racoonus</em> game is still a lot of fun, but the sequels are where Sucker Punch got into the groove. <em>Sly 2 </em>and <em>3 </em>added new playable characters with different skill sets that really made you feel like you were setting up a big heist. God, I miss the Cooper Gang every day. You, too, can be filled with the endless torment of knowing a fifth game isn’t in development right now.</p></div><div><p> I’m genuinely surprised Sony hasn’t greenlit a third <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05289_00-UCUS987020000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05289_00-UCUS987020000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Parappa the Rapper</em></a></span><em> </em>game. Both the original rhythm game and its sequel are available on modern platformers, but Sony hasn’t put out a new one since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01555_00-SCUS971670000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01555_00-SCUS971670000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Parappa the Rapper 2</em></a></span><em> </em>in 2001. The hip-hop rhythm games star the titular dog rapper as he lays down bars during the most mundane life events. Learning to drive a car? Rap about it. Get your first part-time job? Rap with a frog who sounds a lot like Shaggy. <em>Parappa the Rapper 2 </em>goes even more off the rails, but the charm is still there and the songs are all bangers. </p></div><div><p> I got a copy of Sony Cambridge’s <em>MediEvil</em> with my first PlayStation for Christmas 1998. I spent much of my kindergarten year thinking the game was terrifying, only to find out in adulthood the hack-and-slash game is goofy-as-hell and primed for a spooky season replay. It stars Sir Daniel Fortesque, a reanimated soldier who comes back from the dead to become a hero after actually being an embarrassing failure. In 2019, Sony and Other Ocean Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/medievil/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/medievil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remade the game for PlayStation 4</a></span>, and while the game still feels a little dated by modern standards, it’s still a really fun look into an era of PlayStation’s past that Sony doesn’t seem interested in recapturing anymore. </p></div><div><p>Some of the most acclaimed games we’re talking about here are Team Ico’s. <em>Astro Bot</em> has references to <em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and <em>The Last Guardian</em>, but only the latter two are playable on PlayStation 5 right now. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>got a full-blown remake</a></span> in 2018 and, after years of development hell, The<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-guardian/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em> Last Guardian</em></a></span><em> </em>made its way to PS4 in 2016. Team Ico’s work is often defined by slightly clunky gameplay, offset by immaculate, artful stories. <em>The Last Guardian </em>is a shining example of a game that frustrated me to play but absolutely won me over in the end because its final moments are incredible. Team Ico may be gone alongside the rest of Japan Studio, but much of the team still remains under director Fumito Ueda’s new studio genDESIGN. Here’s hoping whatever they put out next is just as magical.</p></div><div><p>Tragically, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-order-1886-ps4-sale-ready-at-dawn-closure-1851617233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-order-1886-ps4-sale-ready-at-dawn-closure-1851617233"><em>The Order: 1886</em></a></span><em> </em>isn’t represented in <em>Astro Bot</em>, but it <em>was</em> in the previous game <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. Developer Ready At Dawn was recently shut down by its corporate owners at Meta, and it was just another reminder of that studio’s potential. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00785_00-TO1886GAME000000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00785_00-TO1886GAME000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Order: 1886</em></a></span><em> </em>isn’t the best cover shooter to grace a PlayStation, but it had a really fascinating steampunk alt-history world that could have been the foundation for a great series. If things had gone a little differently, we could have seen sequels throughout the PlayStation 4 era. It’s a shame, but the game still has a lot of great moments worth checking out.</p></div><div><p>Y’all want one more underrated handheld game that made its way to consoles for the road? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA06171_00-UCUS987110000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA06171_00-UCUS987110000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Patapon</em></a></span> spawned a trilogy of rhythm games for the PlayStation Portable that were so well-loved they ended up mashed together with <em>God of War</em> on a <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>stage. Thankfully, they haven’t been entirely lost as Sony leaves handheld gaming behind, as the first game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07321_00-UCES011770000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07321_00-UCES011770000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its sequel</a></span> were remastered for PlayStation 4 and 5. Real shame they stopped there and didn’t also bring <em>Patapon 3 </em>to consoles.</p></div><div><p>Last on our list of PlayStation gems to go back to is the <em>Ape Escape </em>series. The first two games and the<em> Academy</em> and <em>On the Loose </em>spin-offs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/ape%20escape&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/ape%20escape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are all playable on your PS5</a></span>. If you’re too young to have played the PlayStation classics and were wondering what the first tribute level in <em>Astro Bot </em>was all about, it was an elaborate reference to these platformers. The series has been on ice since 2010, so it’s nice to see Sony at least acknowledge it in <em>Astro Bot</em>. </p><hr><p>Looking back at a lot of these games is bittersweet given the state of PlayStation’s first-party games right now. The PS5 has been mostly defined by carnage for PlayStation Studios between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956">cancelations</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">studio closures</a></span>, so looking back at some of the more experimental and original games the company used to bring out feels bad. You, too can get nostalgic about what once was by looking at all those characters in <em>Astro Bot</em>, I guess.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After a tumultuous year, Unity has made the decision to cancel its runtime fee requirements. The decision comes, Unity says, after “deep consultation” both internally and externally.</p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on the company’s website</a>, CEO and president Matt Bromberg said that the runtime fee went against Unity’s overall mission of “democratizing game development”.</p>



<p>“However, we can’t pursue that mission in conflict with our customers; at its heart, it must be a partnership built on trust,” Bromberg said. “I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We want to deliver value at a fair price in the right way so that you will continue to feel comfortable building your business over the long term with Unity as your partner.”</p>



<p>Back in 2023, Unity announced plans to charge developers a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fee for games</a> after certain installation thresholds, seemingly punishing successful games. They made some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes to the fee after initial backlash</a>, but still kept it in some way. Now, 12 months later, the company says its all going away.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-unity-is-doing-instead-of-runtime-fees">What Unity Is Doing Instead Of Runtime Fees?</h2>



<p>With this latest change, Unity is “reverting” the its seat-based subscription model for “all gaming customers, including those who adopt Unity 6”.</p>



<p>The plans and tiers are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Personal License: </strong>Will remain free, and have a revenue and funding ceiling for $200,000. The “Made with Unity” splash screen becomes optional with Unity 6</li>



<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong>: Starting January 1, 2025, subscription price will be $2,200 per year, per sit. Unity Pro is required of those with more than $200,000 in annual revenue and funding.</li>



<li><strong>Unity Enterprise:</strong> Starting January 1, 2025, a 25% subscription price increase will go into effect. Unity Enterprise is required for customers with over $25 million of annual revenue and funding. Unity Enterprise prices come via custom packages due to the nature of customers with these plans having “unique needs”.</li>
</ul>



<p>“From this point forward, it’s our intention to revert to a more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis,” Bromberg said.</p>

            <p>
Tony Hawk has revealed he's "been talking to Activision again" about the Pro Skater series ahead of its 25th anniversary this September.
</p>
<p>
The original Tony Hawk Pro Skater debuted on 29th September 1999, and would go on to receive four further numbered entries - alongside dozens of spin-offs - culminating in 2020's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-activisions-game-of-the-generation">critically acclaimed</a> (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-fastest-selling-game-in-franchise-history">record-breaking</a>) remake of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, plans to give Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 a similar remake treatment were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-confirms-thps34-planned-until-studio-absorbed-into-blizzard">reportedly scrapped</a> after Activision made the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> - so it could serve as a support studio for the Diablo franchise and other titles.

<p>
But now, it seems "something" Pro Skater related is on the horizon. Speaking on YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIEpU0EF0XI">Mythical Kitchen</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-claims-he-is-talking-to-activision-again/">VGC</a>), Hawks recently revealed, "I've been talking to Activision again - which is insanely exciting - we're working on something."
</p>
<p>
Hawk wouldn't elaborate on the "something" planned for the series' 25th anniversary, but added, "I wish I could tell you more". He did, though, tease that whatever it ends up being, "It will be something the fans will truly appreciate." Beyond that, all we know is Activision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-pro-skater-fans-are-excited-after-this-social-media-refresh">recently freshened up its Tony Hawk social media pages</a> ahead of the series' birthday jamboree.
</p>
<p>
When Hawk previously spoke of the cancelled Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 remakes, he admitted, "I wish there was some way to bring it back," adding, "When all the dust settles maybe we'll sort it out." Might the project have been quietly revived for the series' 25th anniversary since then? Perhaps, as much as that's probably just wishful thinking, or maybe it's been turned into an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>. Either way, with 29th September looming, it shouldn't be long before we find out more.

            <p>Earlier today, Nic covered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-families-is-out-of-beta-letting-you-share-games-with-up-to-five-others">the full release of Steam Families</a>, a feature which makes it easier for families to share a game library and for parents to manage kids' purchases and playtime on the digital storefront. It's a neat improvement over the old system.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I mean, you see it too, right?
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/moustache-family.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>That's a moustache, yeah?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I mentioned this in the RPS Treehouse, and everyone on the team saw something different. Ollie saw not a moustache but a stream of tears running down the face. "I haven't watched much of Evangelion but I feel this is a child sitting in the cockpit of a mech that is also a horrific chimera of both their parents," offered Nic.
</p>
<p>I went back and looked again. And - wait. It's a crab juggling.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crab-families.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Is juggling underwater harder or easier than normal?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You see it too, right? I mean, I'm not the only one. Am I?
</p>
<p>I asked Edwin and he said he sees Sam Fisher, hanging upside down, three glowing green lights waiting to strike.
</p>
<p>All graphic designers know that logos must be studied carefully before they are released to the public. First, does it accidentally contain a swastika? Second, can it easily be turned into genitalia? Check it thoroughly. Look at all the the negative space. Then check it again. I think the the Steam Families logo has successfully avoided such pitfalls. 
</p>
<p>Yet it's clearly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">rorschach test</a>. Look closer at its idyllic family. What do you see?
</p>
<p>It was there all along. It's a sad Sonic. 
</p>

We can’t guarantee an easy time here. We can’t even guarantee a <em>good</em> time here. But we’ll tell you everything we know, regardless.</p><h2 id="h29"><a id=""></a><strong>Preparation</strong></h2><p>Given just how extensively these two fights can absolutely fuck you up, preparation is a number one priority, because while there’s leeway in most boss fights to figure out how to fight your own way and still win, this is a very different story, and there’s certain things every player should consider before you even think of walking up those stairs.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>High Vigor is nice, but you’re gonna need as much raw defensive power as possible here. That’s less about softening blows, more about narrowly avoiding getting one-shotted if you take a hit. The Dragoncrest Shield Talisman can help, as can the Verdigris Discus Talisman for tanks, though, you’re gonna want to keep a medium roll, especially for the second part of this.</li><li>If you fully completed their quests, and they aren’t, uh, downstairs from the boss room, Thollier and Ansbach will be available as NPC summons for this fight. However, tempting as it may be to have all the help you can get, bringing them both in will jack up the boss’s HP. As you’ll learn, you do not want this fight to drag on longer than it has to. In fact, most builds may just want to roll with a fully upgraded Mimic Tear and nobody else.</li><li>You’ll want as much resistance to Holy damage as possible for the second part of this. Some armors will be better than others, and in a fight where two hits can kill you regardless, you can take the tradeoff in other stats. There is, however, one specific item you want to bring for this that will help the most: The Golden Braid, found in the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands. Not only does it feel like it was specifically made for this fight, but if you’ve been paying close enough attention, it’s a rather huge—and incredibly sad—piece of the lore puzzle.</li><li>For Tanks in particular, either mix a Wondrous Physick flask that raises your max stamina and regenerates it faster, or equip the Two-Headed Turtle Talisman. Your stamina’s about to take a beatdown.</li><li>Yes, this is the fight where Miquella’s Broken Rune comes into play, but as we’ll get into, the amount of time needed to use it may not, ultimately, be worth it. Still, if you don’t have faith in your dodge timing, it’s good to have it at the ready.</li><li>In an ideal world, your Scadutree Blessing level is over 13, your Revered Ashes over 8.</li><li>For weapons and spells: Bring anything that can inflict Bleeding, Scarlet Rot, or Frostbite. Bleeding is ideal, though, since building that up strips a big chunk of health off in one shot, usually enough to immediately trigger the next stage of the fight, and anything you can do to not get in an endurance match is a blessing.</li><li>Speaking of: prayer probably wouldn’t be the worst idea.</li></ul><p>Now then.

Now you know why you had to kill Radahn’s crazy, horse-abusing form first before you could even get into the DLC. Sorry to tell you though, Starscourge Radahn is small-time compared to his fully resurrected form. He’ll give you a good example right away, since the first thing Radahn does is launch himself at you with a spinning cyclone move which, for the vast majority of builds, is an immediate one-hit kill.</p><p>If you survive that, then it’s time for a swordfight. That’s not good news. Radahn’s Greatswords are the size of trees, and although his strikes can come in combinations of two to five, even with a tank build, every hit puts a massive dent in your stamina, and even if a Spirit Ash or summon manages to distract him, he can turn around on a dime mid-combo. That’s to say nothing of Radahn managing to land a clean hit, which can easily put you in critical condition. He’s got a couple of extra tricks up his sleeve on top of that. He can perform a somersault strike once or twice in a row. His four-hit combo ends with an overhead swing that buries his blades in the ground, with area-of-effect damage when he pulls the blades out. There’s a two-hit uppercut combo with the two blades that juggles you into the air if the first swing hits, and smashes you back down with the second. That’s also, typically, instant death.</p><p>On the magical side of things, aside from pulling out that spinning cyclone attack if he gets too far away from you, he can enchant his blades with gravity magic, leap in the air, taking chunks of the ground with him, and fire them at you as projectiles. There’s a two-hit combo that creates a bloody rift that hangs in front of Radahn and explodes in a few seconds. That explosion can inflict bleeding on you. And hey, just for old time’s sake, he’ll do a version of Starcaller Cry, except the gravity pull now does continuous sapping damage, and the explosion spawns deadly barbs that can wipe you out in two seconds.</p><h2 id="h31"><a id=""></a><strong>Promised Consort Radahn Strategy</strong></h2><p>So, the big good news is, after FromSoft dropped that 1.14 patch, Radahn is a little kinder and gentler than before, but we’re talking the difference between getting hit by a train versus getting hit by a Jeep. At least one of those scenarios, the driver can slow down a little, and that’s exactly what FromSoft did to Dahnny Boy, compared to the unholy terror he was before. Thanks, Miyazaki.</p><p>There’s some more tiny good news for you: You only need to get Promised Consort Radahn down to about 70 percent health. Of course, the problem is getting even 30 percent of the man’s health down in the most brutal, relentless fight in the entire game. Seriously, once Radahn is in range, he will have his foot on your neck. Just about everything he does will wear down your stamina, your life bar, or both. Extending yourself to do damage is a risk every single time. As such, there isn’t so much a consistent winning strategy for Radahn so much as telling you how to deal with each of his attacks, and you have to make the call on how best to capitalize, and lucking out with his attack patterns plays just as big a role as sheer skill here.</p><p>The only other good news is that, if you listened to me with the Preparations section, if you can inflict one of the three status effects on him fast enough, this fight can be over a lot quicker than anticipated. Your Spirit Ash can help if used wisely, and I reiterate that the Mimic Tear is your best friend with this, just because having two of you doing the same damage in the same way can speed this up. I repeat: you don’t want this to turn into an endurance match. The HP boost Radahn gets from bringing Ansbach or Thollier into this will do just that, which is why you bring them in at your own risk.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-recommend-id="image://e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mighty Radahn has a yawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mighty Radahn has a yawn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-recommend-id="image://e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mighty Radahn has a yawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s the thing, though: The most effective use of the Mimic in this fight requires a mental adjustment. See, most of the time using the Mimic or a summon, its job is to distract the boss while you sneak up behind and do the real damage. It’s the other way around here. You, personally, can adjust and deal with Radahn’s attack patterns on the fly. The Mimic cannot. And as such, your job is actually to pull aggro on <em>yourself</em> as much as possible, partially so your helpers can get some damage in, but mostly with the hopes of keeping your friends alive (and, ideally, with more than half health) for the second stage of this fight. You’ll see why later.</p><p>With those in mind, let’s go over seven different ways Radahn’s gonna try and fuck your shit up.</p><p>1) When you walk in, you’ll have a few seconds to call in your Mimic Tear before he comes at you with the world’s biggest Psycho Crusher. You can roll through that fairly easily once you see him leave the ground, but his next hit is coming the second he recovers.</p><p>2) Sword combos: By now, shieldless folks should have pretty decent common sense when it comes to rolling through combination strikes, and Radahn’s are big, but nearly all of them leave him open just long enough for a single hit. If you’re not a spell user, you’ll want to roll like you’re trying to get around his back. You won’t get there unless your Spirit Ash gets his attention, but it will get you out of harm’s way as long as you time it right. These are the source of your best openings to do damage or heal, however. There’s a fast two-hit combo where Radahn crosses his blades back and forth. Dodge forward on the second hit, and he’ll stand there in a crossed-arms pose for a second. His three-hit can come at any time. It’s dodgeable and blockable, but his follow-up might not be, and dodging or blocking it can leave you low on stamina.</p><p>His four-hit combo (single-blade right, dual blades to the left, followed by overhead slam) is the easiest to telegraph, but the AOE on Radahn pulling his swords out of the ground after the final hit has a bigger hitbox than you might expect for anyone trying to stay close. For shielded players, however, this bit is truly his best opening. After blocking the dual-bladed right-to-left strike of that combo, roll around the overhead smash to get clear. If you’re ambitious, close enough, or have the stamina and poise for it, though, you can block the AOE, and guard counter it. He runs with this combo quite a lot, typically, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility to punish him for it enough that you stagger him. Now, that’s pretty dope if you can make it happen, but fair warning that ripostes don’t even knock him on his back. He’ll be coming for you with a vengeance the second he gets off his knee, ripostes cost stamina, and you need every ounce of that you can get . As with everything we’ve been laying out, make a judgment call there.</p><p>3) There’s a sweet spot of distance away where Radahn will simply lurch towards you. That’s a prime moment for magic users to strike, but anything that locks you into a cast is a danger.</p><p>4) The first strike of his Bloodflame attack leaves a bloody slit in the air. Unshielded players, roll directly backwards twice; once to dodge the second slash, again to get out of range of the explosion. Shielded players, roll left and directly forward. That’ll buy you a hot second to do what you want to do, but then your shield needs to be up and ready for the next problem.</p><p>5) The somersault attack: Another potential opening with a big telegraph, however, assume every time he’s gonna flip twice and you’ll never be surprised. If he only does it once, no harm no foul. If he does it twice, your second roll gives you a few seconds to act.</p><p>6) The leaping debris attack: The dangerous part actually isn’t the projectiles (though, yeah, if they hit, they do a shitload of damage), but the windup. Radahn will stick his blades in the ground, enchanting them with gravity magic, but there’s a big delay between that and his takeoff. It’s roughly two seconds, but you might take the hit on that a couple of times before you get it perfect. The takeoff does do a chunk of damage, but if you survived it, don’t worry about anything else except the debris Radahn will fire down at you. When he’s up in the air, run directly left or right at full speed and leap over the projectiles when they get close. That attack puts Radahn down quite a distance away from you, which gives you a few seconds of reliable recovery time. He’ll typically close that distance either by walking you down, or with another spinning cyclone attack. Without the pressing need to call a Spirit Ash, though, dodging through his landing on that attack gives you an opening of a couple of seconds.</p><p>7) Starcaller Cry: Chances are pretty good, unless you’re halfway across the arena, you’re taking damage from the initial gravity pull. The second you get control back, however, roll twice backwards to avoid the spikes. Probably the hardest of Radahn’s single attacks to avoid, but, as long as you’re not immediately at the epicenter when he strikes the ground, it’s easy to duck out of range. He’s got a couple of seconds recovery time after, as well.</p><p>If you’re diligent, and able to capitalize on any and every fleeting gasp for air Radahn gives you, you’ll get him down to the 70 percent sweet spot. And from there, things will get <em>so much worse</em>.</p><h2 id="h32"><a id=""></a><strong>Radahn, Consort of Miquella Abilities</strong></h2><p>After Miquella enters the chat, it’s a whole new ballgame. Radahn keeps all of his abilities from the Promised Consort phase, except most of them now leave pools of Holy magic in their wake. “Ah, but you didn’t say all of them,” you say, hopefully, desperately. You’re right, after firing the debris attack, he’ll fly across the field at you directly with four afterimage strikes—all of which do heavy damage if even one of them lands unshielded—and his four-hit combo now ends in a giant shower of deadly Holy light. It’s not all of ‘em, <em>really</em>.</p><p>And then there’s the new shit. Radahn will typically start this stage of the fight with his new widespread area-of-effect attack by floating into the air, setting the entire field alight with exploding pillars of Holy magic. He can now teleport around the area before striking with a combo. If you’re at a distance, he can fire the same magical waves as the candelabra-wielding magicians wandering around the Abyssal Woods/Enir-Ilim. He has a standalone afterimage rushing attack which will hit multiple times and strip the life out of you if any one of them lands. The timing on Starcaller Cry changes a bit, with more of a delay after the initial pull, the initial rise of spikes doing less damage, but he’ll follow that up with an illusory strike which ends with a final Starcaller Cry that does a shitload more damage. Radahn also has a rather benign grab attack; if it lands the first time, Miquella places a crown of light over your head, and will very kindly ask you to surrender. If the grab lands a second time, though, you actually will.</p><p>And lastly, there’s Radahn’s nuclear option: Once he’s down to about 25 to 30 percent health, Radahn will take off from the field like a rocket, and after about seven seconds, he’ll crash back down like he’s trying to kill the dinosaurs. To the surprise of no one, it’s instant death if you’re caught anywhere in range of that.</p><h2 id="h33"><a id=""></a><strong>Radahn, Consort of Miquella Strategy</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="a8e843c6f2b2249ca5aaca332bb7f53b" data-recommend-id="image://a8e843c6f2b2249ca5aaca332bb7f53b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maybe he's just sad?

Well, if that didn’t work, I’m very sorry, you’re actually gonna have to try to kill this asshole. And as before, all we can really do is tell you how to deal with this slew of new problems.</p><p>As mentioned, 90 percent of the time, Radahn will start off with the floating area-of-effect explosions. Anyway, if you’re fast, you might actually be able to run out of range of the explosions, but given how unpredictable Radahn is at a distance, this may not be the best option. You’re actually better off getting closer. If you tilt the camera down a bit, you can see where the light shafts will strike, and have a pretty good chance of avoiding them. Even if you do take a hit the first time he does it, though, it does less damage than it will the rest of the fight. That’s especially true if you’ve got the Golden Braid. Thanks, Marika. If you’re close enough, you and/or your Mimic Tear might be able to land a hit or two as he’s rising before you need to start worrying about explosions.</p><p>With enough Holy protection, Tanks have a pretty decent chance of still going toe-to-toe with Radahn the same way they did in his first form, but now you have to square with the fact that your health will be getting chipped away every time Radahn swings on you along with the normal, debilitating stamina damage. If you were sturdy enough to withstand the normal combos, you’re gonna need to learn to roll somewhere in the middle of them. The upside for daredevils, however, is that every single normal sword combo now gives you an opportunity to guard counter the Holy magic at the end of it. Again, extremely good stamina/health management come into play here, but if you’re smart, aggressive, and fortified enough, this can be a wild-ass fight that’s over faster than you think.</p><p>Related to that: Unless you’re using a Greatshield, Radahn will rip through any other shield like toilet paper. So if you’ve gotta get intimate with anything less, be smart. Rolls are still the order of the day, and for the fully unshielded, roll in the opposite direction of any of Radahn’s swipes (e.g., if his sword’s slicing left to right, roll left) unless Radahn goes for his overhead slam at the end of a combo. The final attack of that covers a sizable area, but it also seems to leave Radahn open a little longer. Roll out of range for that, then get back in his face to take advantage.</p><p>For the new Starcaller Cry, dodge it as normal, but after the initial set of spikes come up, wait for the third illusory Radahn to come down before dodging again, then watch for the final strike into the ground. There’s a very odd delay timing on this. Be careful.</p><p>And then the grab attack: So, this is a weird one right here. It’s easy to telegraph, just look for the white sparks right over Radahn’s heart, and dodge literally any direction. If he misses, you can punish him with a hit. Hell, more often than not, if it’s still alive, the grab gets your Spirit Ash more than it gets you, and even if it does, it’s a perfect time to recover, buff yourself, even leaves a brief couple of seconds after Radahn lets go where he’s vulnerable for a couple of hits. Still, it’s a concern just because Radahn likes to use it after long combo strings and moments where you think you might have a couple of seconds to heal up. So, you still want to respect it like anything else. And yes, if you do get marked, here’s the moment you’ve been waiting for: Miquella’s Great Rune is the only thing that can remove the debuff. That said, using it does leave you vulnerable for a few seconds, seconds that you probably won’t get many of during this fight, especially when dodging the grab is so much easier. Oh, and it’s up to you if you’re willing to blow a run, but if Miquella does get the second grab, the instant death is <em>wild</em>, and it also gets you the Let Us Go Together gesture.</p><p>For the afterimage add-on to the debris attack, keep running left or right after you jump the debris, and dodge the afterimages in the same direction. If you’re gonna use anything other than a Greatshield, block the fourth hit only.</p><p>The ground-based illusory rush attack can be deadly, but if it’s dodged, there’s a three second opening where Radahn is a bit of a distance away from you. He’ll be too far away for melee users, but magic can get him good, and right then is a great time for a shot off your flask.</p><p>How about the nuclear attack? If you’re quick, and can see the tell fast enough (Radahn will stop dead in his tracks, there’s a hollow lightning-strikey noise, he’ll kneel, then glow for a second), you can get two to three hits in before the initial takeoff. Once Radahn takes to the stratosphere, though, you need to pick a direction, and make like Usain Bolt. Run. Like. Hell. You will have about seven seconds before Armageddon time, and if you’re still alive when it hits, start making your way back towards Radahn, recovering along the way if need be. Don’t worry, he’s got a long recovery time too.</p><p>That last 20 percent of health is when things are at their most tense. If they were still alive at all, the bomb attack will absolutely kill your Spirit Ashes. Your resources will be low. And all it takes is one fuck up for Radahn to ruin a lot of work from the last few minutes. But keep calm, respect this man’s abilities no matter how low he is on juice, and we promise you, Radahn will die and stay dead this time.</p><p>When you’re done curling up in the fetal position or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIppGLul3Fk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIppGLul3Fk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-enacting that one scream from Predator</a></span>, you’ll notice you’ve collected half a million Runes, and the Remembrance of a God and a Lord, which can be turned in for either one of two variants of Radahn’s Greatsword–which cast the new Holy skills you saw during the fight–or the Light of Miquella Incantation which summons the pillars of Holy light explosions. If you want our recommendation: pick the Lord variant.</p><p>Once you’re ready, activate the Site of Grace, then interact with the little floating spark in the middle of the area to get the last word from Miquella.</p><p>And exhale.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s taken just two days <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since the announcement</a> of the PS5 Pro for scalpers to try and ruin things for everyone else. On Wednesday, it was noticed that the PS5 Disc Drive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-disc-drive-is-selling-out-after-ps5-pro-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was selling out at online retailers</a> like Best Buy and Amazon. Now, just another day later, scalpers are attempting to make profit on the PS5 Disc Drive requirement.</p>



<p>If you want to play physical discs on your PS5 Pro, you need the external disc drive. While it normally costs $79.99, scalpers have already <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=ps5+disc+drive&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_sop=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to eBay</a> to try and extort players for extra price.</p>



<p>Some have listed the drive for as much as $200 + shipping. Others are lower, but still too high at $120. All of it being done in an attempt to convince people that this is the only way to get one of the drives.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Will it work? Unlikely. A source at Sony who spoke on the condition of anonymity tells Insider Gaming that the company expects to have no issues with supply of the PS5 Pro or the disc drive moving forward as the launch of the new console approaches and passes.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can still get the drive at PS Direct, GameStop, and Walmart.</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I checked out the highly anticipated medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and interviewed Martin Klima, Executive Producer at Warhorse Studios. The full interview will go live soon, but in the meantime, here's an excerpt related to the game's technology.</p>
<p><em><strong>I know that you've kept the CryENGINE. Did you consider any other engine early on?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we looked at the technology we were using and considered our options. However, we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs. I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now. We put a lot of effort into improving the performance since that can influence the perception of the game, and we wanted to have a smoother experience.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Did you get the latest version from Crytek or are you still using your own from the first installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We are working closely with Crytek, so we have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization from KCD 1. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do you support hardware ray tracing and/or multiple upscalers in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We support upscaling tech, both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. We are not using hardware ray tracing; CryENGINE has very good software ray tracing.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I remember the first Kingdom Come Deliverance to be quite heavy on PCs.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It was. There were a lot of things that we were doing just by brute force, and I think this additional time we had in the development for this sequel allowed us to optimize a lot, parallelize, and utilize CPUs better. Of course, hardware is faster now, and the consoles have more memory and better performance.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will the game run at 60 FPS on consoles?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is not finished yet, so we're still working on it, but 60FPS is not out of reach for us.</em></p>
<p>After Gamescom, I followed up with Warhorse PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, who confirmed that the software ray tracing mentioned by Klima is actually an improved version of SVOGI, which stands for Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination. SVOGI was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-gets-svogi-onoff-comparison-performance-hit-is-minimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> in the first Kingdom Come Deliverance game and in a few other CryENGINE-powered titles like War of Rights and SNOW. I also got confirmation that SVOGI will be available on consoles, too, for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>The game is slated to launch next year on February 11. Meanwhile, check out Chris's recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hands-on preview.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-discusses-game-development-creating-an-opt-in-environment.979440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-warren-arnold-discusses-game-development-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ff1e915c-de04-42ef-9c0c-9096efac6357" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass"><em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em></a> is now available with three new M-rated titles; <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, </em>and <em>Let Me Finish</em>. Ahead of the game's release we had a chance to talk with Warren Arnold, director of <em>Let Me Finish</em>, to learn about the game's pitch process, what the day to day of Jackbox development is like, and how they found the right balance of 'Naughty' without ruining anyone's night.</p>
<p>Arnold has been with Jackbox Games since <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> for Facebook, which he wrote for as a contract worker. "Once we started doing <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> I came back full-time and wrote very heavily on <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="660ebb7e-b4c1-4b5c-a009-7d4663b03fab" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, after that I was hired on full time and since then they can't get rid of me."</p>
<h2>How Where's The Butt became <em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p>Arnold began our conversation by explaining the origins of <em>Let Me Finish</em>. "It was pitched by our lead editorial Rammel [Chan], and it had us all giggling from the start. The original title was 'Where's The Butt?' The first image he put up had a mailbox that had very rounded parts and it said, 'Where's The Butt?'"</p>

<p>"It was one of those things where the second he asked it in your mind you're just like, 'Well there's only one butt on this mailbox so how is this going to be a game?' but everybody circled something different and had very big opinions about why everyone else was wrong."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When we have people being very wound up, we know we're onto something."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arnold likened the success that they immediately felt internally to the same driving mechanic of a game like <em>Quiplash</em> where "[Jackbox Games] should be able to put something up there and your mind is already putting things together." The players should be getting excited to have the chance to talk about their answer.</p>
<p>A new feature to <em>Let Me Finish</em> that hasn't been part of previous Jackbox titles is the ability to Jump-In. This lets players who aren't part of the main head-to-head debate offer their own answer to the prompt.</p>
<p>Arnold explained that the evolution of this mechanic came from playing the game originally as a one-on-one and having other members of the team continuously adding their own thoughts on the prompt. Since then, it changed the team's mentality in terms of the game's design.</p>
<p>"If a player says they want to do something then we need to listen," Arnold said. "We tried different versions of making it a free-for-all, but that doesn't have quite enough structure. We gave it a lot of room to breath and found what's the best version of this."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair_0.jpg?itok=Lva082sZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair_0.jpg?itok=jAiIMPBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Part of what influenced the final form of this game was that the team wanted to create something that would appeal to the competitive players who would play to win, and to appeal to those who want to "draw cruel stuff and make your joke." Arnold also laughed as he admitted that the latter is more his play style anyway.</p>
<h2>The Development Cycle of a <em>Jackbox </em>Game</h2>
<p>Knowing that Jackbox Games have been creating a <em>Party Pack</em> a year, most with 4+ games available, I was interested to hear what the development cycle looked like.</p>
<p>"Most of the time when you're trying to crack the nut, it's a lot of, 'I don't know what I got done this week, but my brain is exhausted.'" Arnold explained further that it came down to a lot of planning and anticipating the desires of their audience. "As a player what do I want? How can I accentuate what's working about the game and elevate your experience."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What's a very simple and elegant way to make sure you're engaged, you know what we're asking of you, and you can do this fun thing that you couldn't just do at your own house."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the writing of the prompts and the aim for the M-rating, I was interested to know how they found the balance between prompts that would add more kick than a regular Jackbox game but not enough spice to be uncomfortable.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-let-me-finish_0.jpg?itok=cLupbgoJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-let-me-finish_0.jpg?itok=HBIAwycN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Yeah, that's tricky," Arnold began. "Sometimes it is 'you know it when you know it.' One thing we've always tried to do at Jackbox is if you write a prompt, you don't want anyone to say, 'Oh man, that really ruined my night.' So we really try to have open ears internally and externally."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everybody has their own experiences so we just want to be compassionate to that, at the same time we also know we need to make something fun and silly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>, the project was an opt-in endeavor with an importance placed upon creating a safe space. Arnold even added that "you could also opt out. If this is going to places that you aren't comfortable with, A) we want to know why so we can take a different angle on it, or B) this is just your own personal choice and you've decided it's not for you. We just listened, that's the biggest thing we could do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to find this balance between the rating and something "fun and silly," the team was looking for prompts and experiences where anyone could say, "That is a silly thing, it's also a mature thing, but we can all agree that that is a fun topic to explore. It's trying to find that middle part where everyone can say this is a great place to live and have your party."</p>
<h2>Design Meetings With No Ego</h2>
<p>Talking about the design team as a whole, Arnold commended the design team, highlighting just how great everyone has been coming to the table with ideas for the past 6-7 years.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-party-pack-games.jpg?itok=7xwQFaog 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-party-pack-games.jpg?itok=vKo5hUZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking through these design meetings, Arnold was especially complimentary of the team's ability to not be discouraged if an idea isn't immediately picked up. "Everyone knows you're going to have way more ideas, so when something comes up and it fits, we are already able to acknowledge it. No one gets their feeling hurt."</p>
<p>"The design meeting are a lot of fun because we're usually talking about something that's pretty ridiculous. I'd liken it to Apollo 13 where we're trying to solve a problem but the thing we're trying to solve is probably about something's butt," Arnold relayed jokingly.</p>
<p>To wrap up our time, I wanted to know, in Arnold's experience, what is the secret to Jackbox Games' success and he was able to offer two thoughts. The first of which is the 'phones as a controller' gameplay style that they wouldn't be able to do half of their games without, but the other key aspect is how players are able to create memorable experiences and in-group jokes with their friends that stick around long after the game is over.</p>
<p>"We want you to be talking about a game years down the road," Arnold said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One year to the day since Unity announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">its runtime fee pricing model</a>, the software developer <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">is canceling that program effective immediately</a>. “After extensive consultation with our games community and customers, we’ve decided to cancel the Runtime Fee,” said Unity CEO Matt Bromberg in the blog post announcing the news. Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded. That meant instead of paying a flat, predictable rate to Unity, payouts could fluctuate, resulting in potentially higher fees.</p><p>This news caused a massive uproar in the game development community with developers voicing their frustration on social media. Developers argued that the pricing model was implemented without adequate warning, forcing them to either pay the new fees that can’t be adequately budgeted for or make a costly and time-consuming switch to new software. They also claimed the per-download model could be exploited by malicious actors to run up fees on developers they don’t like.</p><p>As a result, some developers publicly committed <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1702416458095972427">to moving away from Unity</a> to other game development programs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23971394/gamemaker-free-indie-creator-licensing-fee-unity">GameMaker</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MegaCrit/status/1713793866779042272">Godot</a>. Meanwhile, a group of mobile developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875396/unity-mobile-developers-ad-monetization-tos-changes">boycotted Unity</a> by turning off ad monetization, freezing ad revenue payouts to the company.</p><p>Unity took several steps to quell developers’ ire. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">restructured the pricing model</a>, raising the threshold at which the per-download fee would kick in to $1 million across all tiers of products. Unity also added a new option that allows developers to choose how to pay: either a flat 2.5 percent revenue share or the amount calculated by the per-download pricing scheme. The company also held <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889346/unity-pricing-model-fireside-chat-overview">a Q&amp;A with Unity Create president Marc Whitten</a> in which he apologized for the pricing model’s rollout. Just one month after the announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">Unity CEO John Riccitiello retired</a> and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24186003/cruises-new-ceo-comes-from-the-world-of-gaming-and-tvs">Whitten left the company</a>.</p><p>This new pricing model returns Unity to a per-seat subscription model, but there’s a catch; starting on January 1st, 2025, pricing will go up for Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise tiers. You can check out the specifics <a href="https://unity.com/products/pricing-updates">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Returning to a subscription model</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Unity is scrapping their controversial "runtime fees", effective immediately. They're reverting to the "seat-based subscription model" that funded the game creation tool previously. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners, we’ve made the decision to cancel the Runtime Fee for our games customers, effective immediately. Non-gaming Industry customers are not impacted by this modification," <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">says the announcement</a> from Unity CEO Matt Bromberg.
</p>
<p>"I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form. We want to deliver value at a fair price in the right way so that you will continue to feel comfortable building your business over the long term with Unity as your partner."
</p>
<p>While the runtime fees have been cancelled immediately, other changes will come with the launch of Unity 6 later this year. Unity Personal will remain free and the revenue cap, after which a fee must be paid, will double from $100,000 to $200,000, and in Unity 6 the "Made With Unity" splash screen will be optional. Unity Pro and Enterprise subscription pricing and revenue thresholds will change on January 1st, 2025.
</p>
<p>Unity's runtime fees charged developers money - typically around $0.20 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-to-start-charging-some-developers-money-every-time-someone-new-installs-their-game">each time their game was installed, and applied retroactively to all games that used the engine</a>. That means that if you released a game using Unity five years ago, you would suddenly start incurring costs everytime a player installed the game. The tracking of installation figures would also be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unitys-per-install-fee-will-be-based-on-estimates-and-unity-may-not-spot-fraudulent-installs-in-advance">based on estimates, with limited ability to spot "fraudulent" installs</a>.
</p>
<p>The change was immediately controversial, with several developers such as Among Us creators Innersloth, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-devs-announce-plans-to-drop-unity-urge-players-to-protest-new-per-install-fees">planning on ditching the platform</a>. Nobody liked the fees, nobody liked their potential abuse, and nobody liked that Unity could change their terms retroactively - meaning there was no guarantee that, if you undertook the multi-year project of developing the game using the toolset, that you wouldn't end up paying far more than you expected because Unity had changed the rules in the interim.
</p>
<p>Unity <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-are-changing-how-their-heavily-criticised-runtime-fee-works">immediately started walking back or clarifying the changes</a>, by excluding Unity Personal from the fees and allowing developers using older versions of Unity to remain on their existing terms. These changes did little to quell developers' concerns.
</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, Unity CEO (and former EA CEO) John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">retired, effective immediately</a>. Matt Bromberg was appointed Unity's new CEO in May of this year.
</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-matt-bromberg-says-runtime-fee-reversal-is-part-of-bid-to-become-a-fundamentally-different-company-">Game Developer</a>, Bromberg called the changes part of a plan to "become a fundamentally different company." Whether that's enough to win back developers' trust, I don't know. I wouldn't bet my business on it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
