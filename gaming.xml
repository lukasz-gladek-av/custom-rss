            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-new-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1240257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that upcoming underwater survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but we've got a new gameplay trailer to keep us going in the meantime.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1962700/view/528724684296950298" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, Krafton and developer Unknown Worlds (which Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>) say that while early player feedback convinced the studios they were "swimming in the right direction", more development time is needed to "improve" in "a few areas", as well as to provide "a little bit more content" for the Early Access release.</p>

<p>This new content will, according to Krafton, include "more biomes, more vehicle upgrades, additional tools", and an expanded story, as well as "more creatures to discover". Given the breadth of the biological phenomena in the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, I'd call that a good reason for a delay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=98lLW2Ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=mWXu_PLk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release has been delayed.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release won't be happening in 2025 anymore, Krafton says it doesn't intend to change anything about the game's creative direction or the team working on it, although that presumably doesn't include the former leaders of Unknown Worlds, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">left the studio</a> earlier this month. No reason was provided for their departure.</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton says you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>devlog that will provide more information about the game soon, although it'll be coming out "a little later than intended".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, it's the upcoming sequel to the 2018 survival game&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, which has already had one standalone followup in the form of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/subnautica-below-zero" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Below Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the original game,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will emphasize co-op play, although it will also feature a solo play option. The game will tell a new story set on a brand new planet full of strange aquatic life to discover (and run away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game).</p>




<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> via Early Access in 2026. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>It's the open environments of tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/every-day-we-fight">Every Day We Fight</a> that have most caught my eye. Huge warehouses, bases, and ruins so stuffed with cover and walkways as to suggest the dominant species on the game's pre-alien invasion earth were sandbag piles. These sprawling layouts aren't just for show or getting a nice height advantage, either. The city is explorable between battles with your gang of resistance members, letting you poke around and scavenge before sneaking into optimal positions for the next scrap against invading aliens.</p>

<p>My own personal reaction to realising I'm trapped in a time loop would be the Bill Murray approach, i.e <a href="https://youtu.be/dTbGzGQCe-o">inserting large slices of cake</a> into my mouth, to the audible disgust of Andie MacDowell. Here, you'll be using it to your advantage by learning the location of useful discoveries for subsequent runs. These roguelite bits also make themselves known through a sort of push-your-luck heat meter, where subsequent fights get tougher and enemies more numerous, but also offer better rewards.</p>
<p>The executive producer on the game is YouTube tactics man ChristopherOdd, who I credit for making me markedly less rubbish at XCOM many years ago by offering the simple but transformative advice to prioritise finishing off aliens over everything else - the thinking being that one stray shot from one lowly sectoid can feasibly still kill your best guy. Good advice! Here's him narrating <a href="https://youtu.be/UGywygR2oLA">the game's feature overview trailer</a>. I should also point out how much I appreciate this kind of calm, epic strings-free explanation of what a game actually is. Good trailer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The arrival of the Rifters brought the world to a standstill, but life goes on for your fighters. Uncover their checkered pasts as they learn to work together. Unveil the mystery of the alien invaders and their control over time as you fight through the streets of a once-beautiful city to reveal the full truth about the war. Your resistance grows stronger with each success, and with each failure – after all, death is only the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every Day We Fight should be on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546080/Every_Day_We_Fight/">Steam in early access</a> by the time you read this, unless you've somehow snuck in the RPS content management system, in which case: get out! The lingering scent of bumeggs and Peter Monyleux squirming is ours to enjoy alone.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publishers-time-loop-tactics-rpg-every-day-we-fight-is-out-today-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers scheme, which currently allows Nintendo Switch Online subscribers to buy Switch 1 games at a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailing its plans in a lengthy <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a> published today, the company said Switch Game Vouchers would be ditched as of January 30, 2026 — meaning fans still have six months should they still wish to buy more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason has been given for the scheme's ending, though it follows Nintendo's decision not to allow vouchers to be redeemed for Switch 2 software, and after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well">the launch of Nintendo's first-ever $80 game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were first introduced in 2019, and offer a flat purchase price for two Nintendo Switch games bought within a 12-month period. In the UK, this price is set at £84, meaning you pay an average of £42 for a game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This typically represents an £8 saving per game from the standard £50 Switch game RRP — and an even greater saving on the select games that Nintendo prices at £60: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Nintendo has not extended the scheme to Switch 2 games, fans have realised they can still use vouchers to buy the original, Switch 1 versions of games with paid Switch 2 upgrades, such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild, offering a cheaper method of obtaining those too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Switch 2 owners can currently buy a pair of Switch Game Vouchers and redeem them to play cross-generational games such as Metroid Prime: Beyond, or the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is due for launch in October. Z-A is priced at the usual £50 for Switch 1, or £60 for its Switch 2 Edition. Buy it using a Game Voucher,  and you can still get the £8 saving for Z-A's Switch 1 edition, before simply paying the £10 upgrade fee to access the Switch 2 Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, Switch Game Vouchers must be redeemed within 12 months after purchase, though Nintendo has said that additional Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-game-development-risks-increasing-due-to-higher-game-prices-and-rising-production-costs-suggests-shorter-development-periods-as-one-solution">the company was now exploring shorter game development cycles for some projects</a> to help keep its costs down, and avoid pricing games too highly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Owlcat Games' The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a space-set third-person action-RPG based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sci-fi-fans-can-save-big-on-the-expanse-complete-series-on-blu-ray-at-amazon/1100-6520164/" data-ref-id="1100-6520164">The Expanse TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-james-sa-corey-captives-war-trilogy-amazon-prime-deal/1100-6525559/" data-ref-id="1100-6525559">the novels by James S. A. Corey</a> (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). When the trailer debuted earlier this summer, the comparisons to Mass Effect were almost immediate. Alexander Mishulin--the game's creative director--recently acknowledged that Mass Effect influenced the development of Osiris Reborn. But the team plans to go in its own direction rather than simply copying Mass Effects' approach.</p><p>"It's different [from Mass Effect] in many ways," Mishulin told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "First of all, we make our story a little bit differently. We're making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency."</p><p>As an example, Mishulin noted that players won't be locked into character paths like paragon or renegade. The player can decide whether their characters come from Earth, Mars, or the Belt. That choice will affect how NPC and companion characters react and relate to them during the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQifuOTTe8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's story is set during the first two and a half seasons of The Expanse, and the player's character will be the captain of the most advanced ship in the galaxy. Regardless of the player's choices, the captain is also a twin, and both siblings are on board the ship. However, the twins may not always see eye-to-eye about the best course of action.</p><p>While there will be multiple romance options on the ship, Mishulin noted that Osiris Reborn will feature "a lot more convenient user interfaces [and] convenient approaches to the gameplay," rather than trying to replicate Mass Effects' gameplay.</p><p>Owlcat Games hasn't set a date for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn yet, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <p>Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The DLC will make its debut later this month, on 15th July, via Steam. Ark: Aquatica will submerge players under the waters, tasking them with "new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements".</p>
<p>It will additionally introduce 21 new tameable creatures, as well as 74 new Engrams (including 7 tek Engrams), and "underwater survival thanks to things like air pockets and propulsion vehicles". </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling a sense of 'once bitten, twice shy' due to those AI slop accusations from earlier this year, the developer has released a really very, <em>very</em> brief release date teaser for the upcoming expansion, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Snail Games and Ark: Aquatica made headlines back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">when a trailer released during GDC was clearly AI-generated</a>.</p>
<p>The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured things like a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing," lead game designer Matt Kohl said in March.</p>
<p>At this time, Kohl stated: "There has been no AI use in development of Aquatica."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-accusations-of-ai-slop-ark-aquaticas-release-date-trailer-is-playing-it-very-safe]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, it was widely reported that a stapler ruined the Nintendo Switch 2 launch for some unlucky players who ordered a unit by a GameStop New York store. Now, you can own this involuntary piece of memorabilia and help a charity in the process.</p>



<p>On X, GameStop has confirmed that the infamous stapler used by an employee to staple a receipt directly to a customer's Nintendo Switch 2 box, puncturing both the box and the screen, has been put up for auction on eBay. The stapler comes with a certificae of authenticity and the first unit that has been damaged by it, complete with damaged packaging, although GameStop assured the system has been repaired and is in full working conditions. The stapler and the repaired system are currently going for almost $109,000, but the price is likely going to get higher by the time the auction ends next week. All proceeds will be going to the <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/#:~:text=Children's%20Miracle%20Network%20Hospitals%20raises,most%20urgent%20needs%20are%20met.">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though the Nintendo Switch 2 launch was marred by this incident for some unlucky players, the release of the next-generation Nintendo console was a smashing success, which is throughly deserved, as the new console is a considerable step up from its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the console by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Chris's review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f52c8599a65/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's now well over a month since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch#conclusion-should-you-get-a-switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s June launch, and it seems the majority of owners are happy with their new console. Gripes about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">the screen</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-we-put-the-switch-2s-battery-through-its-paces-with-a-full-timelapse">battery life</a>, and how quickly the internal memory fills up are all valid, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">the general consensus</a> indicates that the joys outweigh the cons; it's a neat system and we're having a brilliant time with it.</p>
<p>Slow download speeds is another area that has been frustrating some people, although it appears to be far from a universal problem. Asking around the Nintendo Life team, our Switch 2 internet speeds across the board either equal our old Switches or they're faster, significantly faster in some cases. But some Switch 2 users online — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/switch_2_game_download_speeds_via_wifi_are_slower_than_switch_1_in_spite_of_the_newer_faster_hardware">on our forums</a> — have been encountering connection issues, with eShop downloads sometimes taking multiple hours.</p>
<p>Now, one of the many problems with diagnosing and solving download issues is the number of variables involved. I could quote you my WiFi down/upload speeds standing across the room from my router (81.5 Mbps down, 46.6 Mbps up - you can run a test yourself via your Switch 2's System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Test Connection), but that's not much help when you have a different ISP package with different limits and a router with different capabilities and settings.</p>
<p>Physically connecting your dock to your router via the Ethernet port is an obvious thing to try. Looking around online, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbivpQlpc4Y">people have recommended</a> changing your connection settings by upping the MTU value from the default 1400 to 1500 (which increases the packet size and potentially boosts download speeds). Try System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Internet Settings&gt;[your network]&gt;Change Settings&gt;MTU for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82c2c4ac44d69/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1l6aurs/comment/mzi7hig">Shonryu79</a> suggested disabling 'IPv6 Connection' via the same settings menu, and several people apparently saw their download speeds leap after that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, people have fiddled with manual DNS settings and tried power cycling — which, for the non-technically minded, is the posh term for turning it off and on again — to mixed results. Again, with so many factors potentially influencing your connection speeds, a one-fix-for-all solution isn't likely.</p>
<p>Nintendo has its own <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/troubleshooting-slow-download-and-upload-speeds-on-nintendo-switch-2">Troubleshooting Slow Download Speeds page</a>, which I'll paraphrase thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>'Move closer to the router'</em></li>
<li><em>'Move other metal and electronic things away from your console'</em></li>
<li><em>'Connect to a different wireless band'</em></li>
<li><em>'Turn your router off and on again'</em></li>
<li><em>'Update your router's firmware'</em></li>
<li><em>'Still nothing? Contact your Internet Service Provider'</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm. The first four are definitely worth a shot, but Nintendo doesn't offer any Switch 2 settings tweaks to potentially solve the problem. And, personally, I'd rather eat my own foot than initiate any contact whatsoever with my ISP.</p>
<p>Have you had any download speed issues with Switch 2? We're keen to get an idea of how widespread the issue is and try to narrow down whether there is an issue with the console itself that Nintendo could potentially address, or if it's the many and various other internet factors causing upset. Let us know in the poll below, and feel free to share with the community any solutions you've found to Switch 2 connection woes.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be remembered for a very long time as a great technical achievement, given what the console manages to achieve using so little power in both docked and handheld modes compared to other versions of the game.</p>



<p>In a new video comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version and the PC version running on Steam Deck, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> also provided an in-depth look at how the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version compare to the different options available on PC. The comparison is favorable for the new generation Nintendo system, as many settings, like crowd density and volumetric fog, are closer to the medium settings, rather than the expected low settings, while others are closer to the high settings, like ambient occlusion and mirror quality in docked mode. Other settings are difficult to match on the PC version of the game due to the ample customization made for the Switch 2 version, but even then, there are many instances where the port impresses, such as with screen space reflections, which are close to the high PC setting in some scenarios, and distant shadow resolution, which are similarly closer to the high settings on PC in several istances.</p>



<p>Even comparing the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 settings to those of the PlayStation 5 version, the port looks impressive, as some options are set higher on the Nintendo system, although that is easily explained by the fact that the Switch 2 version renders at a much lower resolution. In terms of what's been actually rendered, the Switch 2 version, on the other hand, is in the same ballpark as the PS5 version, and superior to the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions, which was expected given the much better CPU and storage of the new Nintendo system.  The comparison between the two systems, much like the comparison with the PC settings, is quite favorable to the Nintendo system, as it shows how CDPR did not have to deal with extreme cutbacks for the new version of their open-world RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember walking around a yard sale I got dragged to as a nine-year-old and spotting a copy of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> for the original PlayStation. Begging my parents to buy it for me, I spent countless hours skating around Foundry and Suburbia (not even sure I ever made it to Canada). With the release of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em>, I was so excited to hop back into mostly familiar levels, listen to some incredible music, and rack up a high score.</p>

<p>Starting off with the Career Mode, this is everything you should expect returning to <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> and 4. Each game is its own separate career track so you can start at the beginning of <em>THPS 3</em> in the Foundry, or in <em>THPS 4</em>'s College.</p>

<h2>Relive the Classics</h2>

<p>You'll have two minutes to attempt to complete a variety of goals; the more goals you complete, the more levels you'll unlock. There isn't really some big "end goal" or celebration at the end, it's a Career Mode but not a Story Mode.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=oJ8WYL33 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=ugGvg1Be 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The most basic goals are to simply rack up a high score or a high combo. Past that there's objectives to pick up the letters S-K-A-T-E which are a fun challenge that also normally teaches you an interesting line in each level, and a number of very specific challenges to complete.</p>

<p>In London, you'll be performing wall rides on double-decker buses, College lets you hassle frat kids, and you'll be trying to collect stray rivets in the Shipyard. Each of these challenges will prompt players to explore different kinds of tricks, hunt interesting collectibles, or seek out secret spots based on context clues. It does a great job of teaching the player and prompting exploration.</p>

<p>While most of the collectibles to pick up are floating objects that glow and are extremely easy to spot, there's also a number of collectibles that are a bit more vague, like photobombing tourists in Alcatraz. These are definitely the 'harder to come by' objectives, but you'll likely stumble into a few of them while playing the level normally, then it's just up to you to remember where they are and get them all in a single run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who played <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> on the original PlayStation, expect to see some differences in map layouts and even ordering as we have to remember this was a time where there would be wild differences between ports of the same games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An aspect of many of the levels in <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> that I loved, and maybe just something I'm appreciating returning to these games as an adult, is there's normally so much more to a level than what you first experience. In London, a variety of buildings can be grinded to the top of revealing hidden half pipes, and there's a reward for exploration on Skater Island that's <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> inspired.</p>

<p>There are a few new additions to the game for those who have already explored the originals from top to bottom. Of course, the most basic change is that the game handles fantastically; secondly, there is the addition of two new levels. Pinball, a track that begins with you getting boosted out into a downhill style track, and Waterpark, set in a derelict and shut-down waterpark.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the game, you'll also unlock new, more difficult goals for each level. Just when you think you've mastered a track, don't be surprised when a COMBO line or new objective has you stumped. This is a great addition for a pseudo post-game, letting those who know the game like the back of their hands be tested in a whole new way.</p>

<p>I loved exploring Waterpark. There are handrails to slide over, the remains of what I can assume was a lazy river creating a halfpipe through the whole track, and each ride has doors that you can skate into at the bottom, allowing you to pop out at the top.</p>

<h2>Free Skate and Level Creator</h2>

<p>If you don't want to set yourself a two-minute time limit, you can also skate around in Free Skate. Here you'll have access to all of the levels you've unlocked from the campaign as well as access to the directory of fan-created levels.</p>

<p>The fan-created levels are something that I'm most looking forward to. Unfortunately, at the time of review, there hasn't been much movement there. In addition to having the full freedom to create levels like those in the main campaign, the Level Creator has new objects like the boost pads found in Pinball, but also the ability to make goals.</p>

<h2>The Soundtrack Is Some of the Same, and a Lot New</h2>

<p>It wouldn't be <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> without a fantastic soundtrack, and while not all of the original tracks are returning, new ones have been added that fit the tone and vibe of the original game fantastically.&nbsp;Skating through each level, two minutes at a time, you're able to really enjoy all of the music without it getting repetitive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=ovBdKT7b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=T5zE1hS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I enjoyed a lot of the new tracks. They all fit the vibe of the game fantastically, but there's a special bit of nostalgia that hits when one of the classic tracks comes on.</p>

<h2>Visual Upgrades Across the Board</h2>

<p>An extremely satisfying aspect of revisiting these levels ~23 years later is that, comparing the visuals of the original game, even that of the PS2 ports, you can see what the team was going for dialed up to 11 with this remake.</p>

<p>You can see it as soon as you drop into the Foundry. The predominantly grey slabs have been replaced with a factory floor. Flashing lights, workers standing around, and more dynamic scenery (including things to skate on or around). All of these improvements show how much care was put into taking what was already a fun playground and filling it with shiny new toys.</p>

<h2><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the kind of remaster that you want to see. It looks like a shinier version of all of your best memories playing the original and adds just a bit more for new and old players alike to experience.</p>

<p>Even two minutes at a time, it's a delight to skate around the world, interact with all of the different elements of the world, hunt down secrets, and hopefully score some top scores.</p>

<p>After the incredible success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="74d91fb2-42d4-403a-99bf-6dd4d42182c9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12" rel="nofollow"><em>1+2</em></a> and now <em>3+4</em>, all I can hope for is <em>THUG </em>to grace our screens again.</p>

            <p>Sometimes it's fun to just do things that don't make sense. Especially in a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that generally rewards you for embracing the chaos and behaving a manner that'd leave onlookers scratching their heads and slightly afraid.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's one immensely satisfying bit of action those who play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> as a tadpole-slupring hypocrite have, to the best of my knowledge, been unable to get in on since November 2023. No longer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">BG3 modders</a> have stepped in to save us from the scourge that is logical decision making.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is your warning that the minor spoiler gun is about to be fired. Remember the scene when The Emperor offers you a nice tadpole to eat, and you can choose whether to accept that gift or politely decline? Well, there's also the option to unleash your inner drama demon, chuck the Illithid worm on the ground, and stomp on it.</p>
<p>It's cathartic, a bit harsh on the virtual slug, and something any unhinged character worth their salt would go for in an instant. Sadly, all the way back in 2023, Larian opted to use <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-4-now-live_96">the game's fourth patch</a> to ban <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3/comments/17sw69a/no_option_to_stomp_the_tadpole/">folks who've already consumed tadpoles</a> and embraced their worm powers by that point in the game from picking the stomp option.</p>

<p>It makes sense. After all, if you're already on the pro-tadpole train, why would you stomp on one to prove just how against inhaling them you are? That's logic, though. My RPG runs, whenever possible, are not bound by the science of reasoning. I lurch from one choice to the next, unpredictably gravitating towards whichever option takes my fancy, no matter how badly it meshes with my earlier choices.</p>
<p>Enter '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17485?tab=description">Stomp that Tadpole</a>', from modder whatsontheflip. It lets those of us who've been "slurping down tadpoles on the regular" randomly decide to engage stompage, either freely or provided we can pass a level 14 constitution check.</p>
<p>Squish. A squid guy wondering just what you actually stand for, if anything at all. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Bliss. You will never know my true intentions, purple fellow. I am the great stompy slurper, and I am beyond your comprehension.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/attention-massive-baldurs-gate-3-tadpole-hypocrites-this-modll-let-you-get-stompy-for-the-first-time-since-2023]]></content:encoded>

The vouchers don’t expire until 12 months after they’re purchased so it’s conceivable that fans could still stock up on them to buy games throughout 2026, though Nintendo hasn’t yet confirmed any new first-party releases for the original Switch next year besides <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>.<br></p><p>With over 150 million Switches sold and a massive install base, it would make sense for Nintendo to continue supporting the platform—the PS4 continued getting Sony first-party games for years after the PS5 was released--but we’ll have to wait and see.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969]]></content:encoded>

To smelt, you first need to build a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Minecraft_furnace_types">Minecraft furnace types</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three different types of smelters you can build in Minecraft.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528291" data-ratio="0.56222639149468" data-width="1599" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528291"></a><figcaption>Smelting with furnaces in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Furnace">Furnace</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the first smelter you'll have the resources to craft. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-furnace-in-minecraft/1100-6526071/">standard furnace</a> works for all types of resources you can smelt, such as food, ore, and sand. You can even smelt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-terracotta-in-minecraft/1100-6525032/">terracotta</a> to create colorful glazed blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">This furnace only requires eight pieces of cobblestone to build. You can also quickly craft one in the Nether by using Blackstone.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Blast_Furnace">Blast Furnace</h3><p dir="ltr">The blast furnace provides a speedier way to smelt ore types, but it doesn't work for food or other materials. To build, it requires five iron ingots, three pieces of smooth stone, and a regular furnace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Smoker">Smoker</h3><p dir="ltr">The smoker is exclusively built for cooking food, and this will cook faster than the furnace. The build requires four wood logs and a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Campfires">Campfires</h2><p dir="ltr">While these don't look like the other furnace types, it's worth mentioning you can also cook food on campfires. The campfires are lit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-and-use-minecraft-flint/1100-6533030/" data-ref-id="1100-6533030">flint and steel</a>, and these can cook four pieces of food at once.</p><p dir="ltr">To build a standard campfire, you'll need three logs, three sticks, and one piece of coal.

Here we'll list several resources you can use as fuel, including efficient sources and the less recommended options.</p><p dir="ltr">The most efficient fuel sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lava bucket: Can smelt 100 items</li><li dir="ltr">Coal block: Can smelt 80 items</li><li dir="ltr">Dried Kelp block: Can smelt 20 items</li><li dir="ltr">Blaze Rod: Can smelt 12 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of coal: Can smelt 8 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of charcoal: Can smelt 8 items</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Resource-wise, stacks of coal will be one of the easiest and most efficient fuel sources, especially early in your game. Lava Buckets will be best suited for when you're trying to smelt large qualities of ore.</p><p dir="ltr">Less efficient fuels sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wood logs, planks, fence pieces, wood crafting tables, bookshelves, and more will smelt 1.5 items each</li><li dir="ltr">Wooden tools, signs, and wooden doors will smelt 1 item each</li><li dir="ltr">Then you have other normal items that will smelt less than 1 item each, including wool blocks, carpet, seeds, and bamboo</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These normal items aren't efficient to use as fuel, but in a pinch, you can throw these in your furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Experience_points_and_achievements">Experience points and achievements</h2><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that smelting contributes to your experience points. You gain valuable XP every time you retrieve smelted items from the furnaces.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also Minecraft achievements tied to smelting various items, including cooking your first cake and bread.</p><p dir="ltr">Now that your furnaces are up and running, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is ending its Switch Game Voucher service in January next year, the company announced today.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers, for those unaware, are a special offer for Nintendo Switch Online members, which can be purchased in a set of two, and are used to save on games.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">members can purchase two vouchers for £84.00</a>, and redeem them against Switch games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which retail individually for £59.99 each. Buying these games on their own would come to £119.98, but if vouchers were used to make these purchases, users would save £35.98. (Vouchers can not be used for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> titles.)</p>
<p>However, the popular service is set to end next year, on 30th January, and after this time, vouchers will no longer be available to purchase. Any vouchers purchased prior to 30th January 2026 will remain valid for 12 months, and Nintendo has said Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p>
<p>Nintendo has not said if it will introduce a similar offer for Switch 2 games down the line. You can find more information on Switch vouchers, and the end of the service, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NintendoSwitchOnline|NULL|NSOGameVoucherDiscountinuationAN|m_id_SnUV8HHzNg|1560656">via Nintendo</a>. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many are disappointed to hear of Nintendo's decision to end its Switch Game Voucher service. "Well this is sad," <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1943222381528395877/quotes">reads one of many social media posts</a> following today's announcement.</p> <div>

In the world of Umamusume: Pretty Derby, racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and apparently many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in their enthusiasm, it seems that some fans may have caused distress to their favorites and their owners in real life. As previously reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/umamusume-pretty-derby-devs-urge-fans-to-not-pester-real-life-racehorses-3224393/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>, Cygames shared guidelines for those who want to visit real-life racehorses in Japan, reminding people that you can’t just rock up to a ranch and that horses are easily startled by loud noises and camera flashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 9-point guideline was created by the <a href="https://uma-furusato.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Racehorse's Hometown Information Center</u></a>. The first two points urge would-be visitors to check with the center for tour availability and to confirm tour times before visiting. The rules also remind visitors to follow the instructions of ranch staff at all times, to refrain from smoking on-site, and not to enter stables or pastures without permission. The rest of the rules are centered on the horses’ wellbeing — don’t make loud noises and refrain from touching, feeding or taking flash photography of the horses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/image005-1752142593002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby's English language launch has exploded.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Cygames has been fostering strong connections to the Japanese horse racing world — it often shows up alongside and provides support for racehorse-related exhibits at events in Japan, and has donated to the Retired Racehorse Association of Japan (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20240304-27999/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).

            <p>The infamous stapler used by GameStop that ruined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch day for some customers has now been put up for auction.</p>
<p>As we reported previously, one retail store in New York was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-ends-in-disappointment-for-some-as-major-retailer-accidentally-staples-receipts-into-consoles-screen">stapling customers' receipts to the console's packaging</a>, damaging screens in the process.</p>
<p>Now - in an offer of goodwill, but also something of a publicity stunt - GameStop has put the stapler up for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731">auction on eBay</a>, with proceeds benefitting Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a charity founded over 40 years ago, and has raised over $9bn for 170 children's hospitals.</p>

<p>The stapler is being offered alongside a Switch 2 console and a certificate of authenticity for the bundle.</p>
<p>Reads the certificate: "The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer's new Nintendo Switch 2 box - puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion. Features authentic field-use wear throughout and retired immediately from service, the stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision."</p>
<p>The included console is also the first to be stapled, though GameStop assures the screen has been repaired. It will arrive in the original, stapled packaging, and also include the actual staple "carefully extracted and preserved".</p>
<p>As per eBay, the item is in "used" condition: "The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended." At the time of writing, the auction stands at almost $109K, with another six days until it ends.</p>
<p>Following the launch day incident, GameStop stated staplers "have been confiscated" and that their use was "isolated to one store".</p>

<p>Despite this stapling incident, the Switch 2 launch was a success for Nintendo. With 3.5m units sold worldwide in its first four days on sale, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware ever</a>.</p>
<p>And if children are unable to afford a Switch 2, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-president-says-children-should-engage-with-its-characters-elsewhere-if-they-cant-afford-a-switch-2">plenty of other ways for them to engage with Nintendo characters</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-ruining-stapler-now-up-for-online-charity-auction-by-gamestop]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that they are ending the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> subscribers, removing them from sale on 30th January 2026.</p>
<p>Any vouchers purchased prior to the end of the programme will still be valid for use for the usual 12 months before they expire, but no further vouchers will be sold after 11:59 PM in your local market on 30th January 2026. So the vouchers will last until 30th January 2027.</p>


<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were introduced as part of Nintendo Switch Online, a popular way of getting Nintendo’s games at a discount, outside of rare sale periods. Purchased in a pair for $100 / £84, you could then redeem these vouchers against two games from a curated catalogue of titles. With games often priced at $60 / £50, this could net a combined saving of $20 / £16. Potentially even more, as the £60 Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a part of the program, and the new and upcoming titles, such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, can also be included.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall for this program when Nintendo announced increased game prices for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers can only be redeemed against Switch games, as it stands, so the aforementioned Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Tears of the Kingdom would then need a further upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The value of the offer can also be seen to be diminishing for savvy gamers who are happy to wait for Nintendo to put parts of their back catalogue on sale. At those times, games can drop to around £30, which is obviously a much larger discount.</p>

<figure><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9650f1602f54c/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember when GameStop made the news following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">unfortunate incident involving a newly-bought Switch 2 console and a stapler</a>? Yeah, one store thought it wise to staple receipts onto the Switch 2 box, puncturing the cardboard and damaging the screen of the Switch inside.</p>
<p>It wasn't a good look for the company, but now, GameStop is looking to turn the whole thing into a positive by auctioning off the stapler and the damaged Switch 2 on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">eBay</a>, with all proceeds going to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>

<p>And y'know what, fair play! Yes, it's a massive publicity stunt to save face, but it's a decent one at that, and bidding has already reached <strong>$108,895</strong> at the time of writing with over 6 days remaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">GameStop tried to make light of the whole situation</a> in the days following the staple incident, but wound up getting into even more trouble when it became evident the company used someone else's photo without providing credit. It posted a joke announcing restocks of the Switch 2 along with the tagline "Staples not included", but the photo used belonged to Janelle Jones of Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Water under the bridge, and all that. GameStop gets a lot wrong, but this might be one of those rare occasions in which it's made a pretty good decision. Keep going.</p>

            <p>It's been years, Gerry from the Riviera, but you can finally stop knocking on a certain Duchess' door in the hopes she'll let you see whether some Elven staircases are as spirally as you remember. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> modder has used REDKit to open those doors and had a crack at making a lore-accurate interior for Beauclair Palace, the posh setting of the fantasy game's Blood and Wine expansion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's the latest in an ongoing series of location revamps by snappily-named modder "OlivierR45455566465", after getting their hands on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s handy modding tools. They've previously done stuff like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9563?tab=description">restoring Kaer Morhen</a> to the glory it might have had before it hosted ten million witchery fights. The modder also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9835">rebuilt the manor</a> that ends up a bit on fire in the game's other DLC, Hearts of Stone.</p>
<p>For the last few months, OlivierR's been working on this latest project, which is all about letting players waltz through some doors to explore "an expanded and book-accurate Beauclair Palace". It's something folks have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher3/comments/ro58s8/are_there_any_known_mods_to_explore_inside/">requesting for years</a>, and to make it possible, the modder's built a full interior for the upper section of the palace.</p>
<p>These newly explorable sections comprise two main buildings, with the likes of the three-floor main tower, plus the Duchess' bedroom and throne room. That's in addition to a bunch of areas described in the Witcher books, such as the knights' hall, the library, and a secret chamber. You can also take a gander at the treasure room or just chill in one of the many living rooms.</p>
<p>"Even though I had to work under severe restrictions, due to the fact I was once more working inside an already built exterior, I have tried to remain as faithful as I possibly could to the books and the game, both in the aspects and in the content of the modifications I made," wrote OlivierR.</p>
<p>They've even taken extra steps like setting up a bunch of new NPCs with their own routines to patrol the rooms, tweaked the volume of each area, and "corrected some structural inconsistencies" the palace had. Plus, some dynamic changes will happen when you finish certain Blood and Wine quests.</p>
<p>Once the mod's installed and you've launched the game with Blood &amp; Wine enabled, you'll be able to wander into the palace at any time. It's a cool addition to the sightseeing I know I always do whenever I arrive in Beauclair, even though I've already seen every nook and cranny of not-France a million times.</p>
<p>Plus, it makes sense Gerry would want to reminisce about his adventures in bookland. Now all we're waiting for is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman">massive palace slide</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fancy-snooping-around-the-witcher-3-palace-from-blood-and-wine-well-this-mod-gives-it-a-book-accurate-interior]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a week after Krafton replaced the co-founders and leaders of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer Unknown Worlds, the company has now confirmed that the game’s early access release will be delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>There’s been plenty speculation over the reason why Krafton removed the studio leaders last week, with a $250 million bonus on the line and the possibility that Subnautica 2’s release could be delayed. Having reviewed the purchase agreement for the studio in 2021, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> is able to report that the $250 million bonus was due to kick in if Unknown Worlds was able to hit a revenue target by the end of 2025. With no Subnautica 2 launch this year, the studio is unlikely to hit that target, and so employees could miss out, per Bloomberg’s anonymous sources.</p>


<p>So it’s no surprise now that Krafton is adamant that the firings and delay have absolutely nothing to do with any kind of bonus agreement, while founder Charlie Cleveland claims that the game was ready for an early access release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/embed/inset/iframe">a blog post on the series subreddit</a>, Cleveland said, “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">In a contrary statement, Krafton said that the delay stemmed from feedback from early tests and “It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Meanwhile, in a town hall meeting with new CEO Steve Papoutsis, he said, “The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> available for its early access. While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, ‘Hey we should launch this,’ that wasn’t where both parties aligned around.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">That does seem to suggest that an Early Access was plausible with the game as it is now. However, he added “it’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">It’s an ugly mess for a game that was one of the most highly-anticipated titles on Steam for this year (or any year, to be honest).</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">But at least the co-founders are now free to go and make more games. Signing off on his blog, Cleveland says, “I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is being delayed into 2026 by its publishers Krafton, which would lead to the survival game's studio missing out on a previously agreed $250 million bonus, meant to be shared among employees. The revelation comes via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout">a report from Bloomberg</a>, and could finally explain why Krafton ousted the studio's most senior figures last week. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Three higher-ups at the studio were summarily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out last week</a> and "replaced" with the CEO of Striking Distance, Steve Papoutsis. The studio's original co-founder, Charlie Cleveland, was one of those who felt the sharp toecap of Krafton's boot, and has since said it came as a "shock". </p>
<p>In a letter posted to social media, Cleveland wrote that the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">"ready for early access"</a>. This is in contradiction to Krafton, who have spoken about delivering "the right game at the right time" and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-creators-offer-no-explanation-for-sudden-regime-change-instead-promise-no-loot-boxes">communicated via Unknown Worlds</a> that there would be an "update to our schedule". </p>

<p>However, during an all-hands meeting, workers at Unknown Worlds questioned new CEO Papoutsis about the reasons for a planned delay. And those clever sneaks at Bloomberg heard a recording of his response.</p>
<p>When asked about the coup and the intended delay, Papoutsis reportedly said: "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn’t where both parties aligned around." (Let us award the producer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> some corpopoints for using "aligned around" instead of human language like "agreed".)  </p>
<p>When asked whether a delay was being enacted to avoid paying out the bonus, Papoutsis replied: "It’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that."</p>
<p>We've contacted Krafton for comment. They have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus">confirmed the delay to IGN</a>. A <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">statement</a> on Unknown Worlds' website says the delay is meant "to give ourselves a little extra time." </p>
<p>"[The] events of this week have been quite a shock," said Cleveland in that letter to fans. "We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p>
<p>It's good at least to have a little clarity about the reasons why such a dramatic power shuffle has occured. The former Unknown Worlds leadership and Krafton disagreed about the game's readiness, and both parties had an incentive to be right. In this case, Krafton used a blugeon to settle the issue.</p>
<p>In April, Krafton <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-achieves-record-high-quarterly-sales-in-q1-2025/">reported record profits</a> in the first quarter of 2025, hitting $608 million in sales and $308 million in operating profit. Its CEO, Kim Chang-han, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11267646">received a bonus</a> last year of $3.9 million.</p>
<p>Subnautica 2 is the second most wishlisted game on Steam, only beaten by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is officially delayed to 2026, publisher Krafton has confirmed to IGN. The news follows a report that claimed the delay may cost the development team a $250 million bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton, the Korean company behind smash hit battle royale PUBG, acquired the $500 million-valued Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds in October 2021. At the time, Krafton insisted Unknown Worlds would continue to operate as an independent outfit. Following its announcement, the hotly anticipated Subnautica 2 was set for an early access release later in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill, were replaced by former Striking Distance CEO, Steve Papoutsis, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">a shakeup that shocked the Subnautica community and sparked concern over the sequel’s future</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleveland subsequently revealed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a> that while he and his colleagues believed Subnautica 2 was "ready for early release... that decision is in Krafton's hands." Krafton issued a community update of its own, suggesting a delay was incoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported that Subnautica 2 was delayed to 2026 — just months before it was due to pay a $250 million bonus to the development team. Bloomberg added that the delay was “against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership,” and that the $250 million bonus would have kicked in if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. Without Subnautica 2 coming out this year, hitting those revenue targets is unlikely, and the bonus won’t be paid out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Bloomberg:</p><blockquote>Unknown Worlds’ leadership planned to share the additional money with all of the studio’s employees, which number around 100. Staff who were at the company at the time of the acquisition were told they were eligible for bonuses ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures, the people said.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Krafton has made Subnautica 2’s delay to 2026 official, but in a statement to IGN, it insisted the decision had nothing to do with “any contractual or financial considerations.” Instead, Krafton claimed, the delay was about responding to feedback from playtests, and delay talks were already under discussion before Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were outed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Krafton’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>During playtests for Subnautica 2, we received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game's direction. At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release.</blockquote><blockquote>As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience. As a result, Subnautica 2’s Early Access launch has been rescheduled for 2026.</blockquote><blockquote>This decision was based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players. It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations. Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans, the wait for Subnautica 2 goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">"tentative agreement" reached last month</a> between video game voice actors represented by union <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> and companies including Activision, Insomniac, and EA, the 11-month strike is now over. A new contract has been approved, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">"effective immediately"</a>. with 95% of participating union members voting in favour, with 5% opposed.</p>
<p>The terms of the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/2025%20Interactive%20Media%20%28Video%20Game%29%20Agreement%20Summary.pdf">Interactive Media Agreement</a> include increased performer compensation, including overtime rates, and "guardrails" against AI - "including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for the generation of new material during a strike".</p>

<p>“We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers," said spokesperson Audrey Cooling, "on behalf of the video game producers that are party to the agreement".</p>
<p>Those enhanced health and safety measures, as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike">Game Developer</a> note, mean trained medical staff will need to be present at rehearsals and performances that plan "hazardous actions or working conditions". Employers also won't be able to request actors do dangerous stunts in auditions, and performers will have mandated rests.</p>
<p>In terms of AI protections, the new contract will ensure performers receive specified minimum payments for use of digital replicas made from their performances, higher compensation from the use of chatbots based on their performances, and payments when their performances are used in future projects.</p>
<p>Last January, SAG-AFTRA struck a deal with the <a href="https://www.replicastudios.com/">now-closed Replica Studios</a> to allow voice actors to license 'digital replicas' of their likenesses and voices. "We have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances,” said the union's director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland at the time, with union's announcement calling the move "approved by affected members of the union’s voiceover performer community”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">This drew criticism from several prominent actors</a>, including Deux Ex: Human Revolution's Elias Toufexis. "I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors working in games," the actor said back then, "No one asked me about this. No one reached out for my opinion. From what I'm seeing, no one asked any of my peers either."</p>
<p>The Interactive Media Agreement classifies these "Digital Replicas" as either "Vocal" or "Visual", defined as being capable of "algorithmically generating new performances" in the voice or likeness of a specific performer. The now-ratified contract requires clear consent from performers, including knowledge of a “reasonably specific description of intended use”, specifying things like genre, profanity, violent or sexual content, stunts, and whether the performer will be reprising a specific role.</p>
<p>There's also this bit, which I'm sure is necessary, but also makes for some fascinatingly grim reading.</p>
<blockquote><p>4) Deceased Performers:</p>
<p>(a) Consent that Performers grant during their lifetimes shall continue to be valid after death unless explicitly limited otherwise at the time of the initial consent.</p>
<p>(b) If Performer is deceased at the time Employer seeks consent, Employer shall obtain the consent of the authorized representative (e.g., their estate).</p>
<p>(c) If the deceased Performer’s authorized representative cannot be identified or located, consent may be obtained from the Union.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the contract is largely being celebrated as a victory for union members, SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-vas-are-starting-to-call-for-the-end-of-the-sag-aftra-strike.1195908/">received criticism from actors</a> for allegedly prolonging the negotiations process after the sought-for AI protections were in place, making it difficult for performers to get work.</p>
<p>My favourite characterisation I've read of these fairly dry stipulations was Chris Kerr's over at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-proposed-ai-protections-will-let-performers-send-their-digital-replicas-on-strike">Game Developer</a>, who points out that performers now effectively have the ability to send their digital replicas on strike. If <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">James Earl Jones called me a scab I'd probably cry</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-over-with-new-ai-agreements-reached-over-digital-replicas]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a while since we heard anything about Marvel's Blade. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-announced-arkane-lyon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the 2023 The Game Awards event, when we learned that Arkane Lyon, the studio behind Dishonored and Deathloop, would be behind it. </p>



<p>The only other thing we know about it is that Marvel's Blade <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkanes-blade-game-to-run-in-deathloops-and-dishonored-2s-void-engine-senior-lighting-artist-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be powered by Arkane's own Void Engine</a>, previously seen in the aforementioned games, thus making Arkane Lyon one of the few studios that still sticks to proprietary technology instead of switching to Epic's Unreal Engine 5, as so many big studios have done (CD Projekt RED and Crystal Dynamics, to name two).</p>



<p>But what is the development status of the game? Well, it seems like it just entered full production. The information was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timur222.bsky.social/post/3ltlhwfmlac2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by eagle-eyed videogame enthusiast and 'Internet explorer' Timur222, who discovered it in Arkane Lyon's 2024 financial document (written in French), where the studio wrote:</p>



<p><em>Game development activities exclusively for the ZeniMax/Microsoft group are continuing. The production phase of the AAA game project was able to begin at the end of 2024, following prototype validation.</em></p>



<p>Marvel's Blade is the only triple-A game in development at Arkane. There can be no confusion there, especially after Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the Austin-based sister studio last year</a>. Given the average triple-A game development time and the fact that Deathloop launched in September 2021, the game's release window will likely occur between 2026 and 2027, probably in the latter year. </p>



<p>Needless to say, we'll report any other leaks or rumors ahead of the official unveiling. Stay tuned.</p>

The funding will go directly to the salary of the person hired to archive toy catalogs, a crucial task for the museum.

The museum plans to proceed with both projects, but scope, timing, and size is in limbo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jon-Paul Dyson, Strong Museum senior vice president and director of the International Center for the History of Electronic Games, told Game Developer that the museum receives around 700,000 guests a year and explained its funding comes from admissions and memberships, plus a trust that supports the museum. The grants aren't essential to the day-to-day functions of the museum, but enable it to take on special projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This work of preserving games, celebrating games and speaking about their importance, not just to people who love video games, but to people more broadly, even those who don't consider themselves gamers, is really vital work," Dyson said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rabindra Ratan, associate professor at Michigan State University's Department of Media and Information, told Game Developer that he and his team were awarded $1.6 million by the National Science Foundation's Future of Work program in 2021 to research and develop a program to "reduce issues of Zoom fatigue and other types of gender and race inequities in the games industry related to virtual meetings." Most of that money was spent on the research over the years, but when the grant was rescinded this year, they lost an unspent $200,000 they intended to use to finish the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were in the home stretch," Ratan said. "The main goal of the home stretch was to get our work out into the games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ratan and the team did all the research and built out a virtual world that was designed to be a more effective meeting space — taking into consideration gender and racial disparities in the industry. Now, they no longer have the funding needed to fully realize their vision. The platform is publicly available still, and Ratan intends to put the research materials up online, but there's no longer the budget to pay students and professors to tie up the loose ends of the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our mission was to help promote equity in the games industry, and like in many industries that are impacted, the cancellation is part of what we see as an ongoing culture war against people who are trying to reduce systematic inequalities in those fields."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Public development grants in the U.S. have become an endangered species">Public development grants in the U.S. have become an endangered species</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rebecca Bria, assistant anthropology professor at The University of Texas San Antonio's College of Liberal and Fine Arts, told Game Developer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=MT-304037-25">her virtual reality game project</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paccha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was "severely impacted by the rescinding of the NEH grant shortly after the work began."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paccha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a virtual reality adventure and puzzle game in which players act as a student archaeologist investigating different areas of the Peruvian Andes. It's co-developed by Bria and game developer and artist Bruce Carlisle. They explained they spent two years conceptualizing the game "while conducting preliminary research, digitizing ancient objects and spaces, and doing outreach in Peru to ensure community buy-in and active collaborations with descendant populations." Planning and applying for grants took two years, but they were eventually awarded $100,000 for prototyping from NEH. The grant finally arrived in February 2025. They were able to complete just two months of work before the Trump administration pulled the plug.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Grant opportunities to develop a game like ours — through NEH or elsewhere — are rare and competitive," Bria and Carlisle said. "Our award comes from the NEH program called 'Digital Projects for the Public,' which is extremely competitive. They have an intense peer review process, require an advisory committee of humanities scholars as well as partnerships with museums/universities and communities, and they often require applicants to submit multiple submissions and revisions to win. Unfortunately, not only did DOGE rescind our award but the NEH website indicates that the agency was made to completely discontinue the Digital Projects for the Public competition moving forward."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They said the NEH award was "vital" for the project&nbsp; to be able to "accurately and ethically present the people and artifacts of the Indigenous Andean past." The prototyping grant was the first step in a long process in acquiring future funding to produce the game. "Losing the award is devastating," they said. "Now that this NEH funding pipeline from Prototyping to Implementation has vanished, our trajectory for completing the game is also halted."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bria said the cuts stalled research, put partnerships (like one with the San Antonio Museum of Art) on hold, removed "financial support for community collaborators in the Peruvian village and archaeological site of Hualcayan where our game is set," and ended payments to game developer Carlisle, who is no longer able to work full time on the title as a result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, like other researchers and institutions impacted by the sudden axe to their already-awarded grants, they're looking for different ways to fund the game, be it through private funding or via the NEH program being reinstated. It's a baffling and devastating blow to projects, and a decision that will surely impact the study of video games—something that could have lasting impact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The video game industry is at the forefront of experimentation and exploration in technological developments in many realms," Ratan said. "By limiting research in this industry, it is limiting science as a whole. There's a slightly more direct negative consequence here in hindering progress in the games industry, namely being that progress in the games industry leads to other industries."</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development]]></content:encoded>

<p>But more games will be made eligible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e41d8659b2591/game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be ceasing sales of the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme from <strong>Friday, 30th January 2026 at 23:59 JST</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who might be unaware, Game Vouchers would come in pairs and would therefore allow you to purchase two first-party eShop titles at a discounted price. So in the UK, for example, a pair of Game Vouchers costs £84, granting access to two titles priced at £49.99 each, thus saving you approximately £16. Pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>No more, though! Nintendo had already announced that Game Vouchers wouldn't be compatible with the Switch 2, but now it's gone one step further and is bringing an end to the scheme entirely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pzgkjy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>It's not all bad news, though. Sort of... Game Vouchers are valid for one year after purchase, and Nintendo has stated that it will be introducing more games to the scheme following the cessation of sales at the start of January.</p>
<p>We can't say for definite which games might be added, but we reckon there's a good chance we'll see the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, both of which are scheduled to launch in 2026. Then, of course, you've got the Switch 1 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> launching later this year.</p>
<p>It's a shame this will no longer be a thing, though. Hopefully Nintendo will offer up some sort of alternative for the Switch 2, because if it wants to continue pushing folks toward digital purchases, then it'll need to introduce an enticing deal for those hesitant to leave physical media behind.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12.13pm: </strong>Krafton has told Eurogamer the decision to delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s early access release into 2026 was "under discussion" prior to any leadership changes at developer Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"During playtests for Subnautica 2, we received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game's direction. At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. "As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we've made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience. As a result, Subnautica 2's Early Access launch has been rescheduled for 2026."</p>
<p>Krafton's spokesperson stated the decision was "based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players" and affirmed it was not "influenced by any contractual or financial considerations".</p>
<p>Additionally, "the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio," Krafton closed.</p>
<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 10.07am: </strong>Krafton has delayed the release of Subnautica 2, right before the game's development team was reportedly set to receive a substantial bonus for reaching previously determined revenue targets.</p>
<p>Subnautica 2 is being developed by Unknown Worlds, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">Krafton acquired in 2021</a>. Word of the game's delay comes just a week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">Krafton ousted key members of Unknown Worlds' development and leadership team</a>, including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated underwater sequel was slated for an early access release this year, however Krafton has moved that window back to an unspecified date in 2026. According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a>, this change happened mere months before Krafton was expected to pay the development team a $250m bonus, which would have applied had the studio met certain revenue targets by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Due to the game's delayed release, Unknown Worlds is now unlikely to be able to meet these targets, sources told the publication, meaning that it will miss out on the payout. According to Bloomberg, this delay was not supported by the former leadership at Unknown Worlds, who had planned to share the bonus with all studio employees.</p>
<p>Krafton stated it had delayed the release of Subnautica 2 to improve the game's quality following feedback from playtests. "It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations," Krafton claimed.</p>
<p>Last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as chief executive officer Ted Gill, were all "pushed out" from the studio by Krafton. Following his dismissal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">Cleveland shared a statement on reddit</a>, where he called the events of the week "quite a shock". In this same post, he said Subnautica 2 was ready for its early access debut.</p>
<p>"And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton's hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings," Cleveland wrote.</p>
<p>"I want you to know that whatever happens to the founders, to the team and to the game, our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world... And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p>

</span></p><p>Now that Cleveland, McGuire and Gill have been removed from the company, Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis has been put in charge of Unknown Worlds. Earlier this week, Papoutsis reportedly said Krafton did not believe that Subnautica 2 was ready to be released in early access in 2025, and more content was needed.</p>
<p>In audio listened to by Bloomberg, the new studio head was further questioned about the motives for the delay beyond this, including if the $250m bonus was a factor. "It's a good question, and I would appreciate patience on this particular topic," Papoutsis replied during the meeting, adding he was not familiar with the specifics of Krafton's acquisition of Unknown Worlds or the contract itself at the present time.</p>
<p>"The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of Subnautica 2 available for its early access," he continued. "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn't where both parties aligned around." Papoutsis added: "it's never been told to me that we're making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Krafton for comment on today's report.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers]]></content:encoded>
