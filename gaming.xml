Although we’ve seen her younger self briefly in flashback scenes, the arrival of adult Sister Francesca (Tabu) to House Corrino in the penultimate episode revealed the lengths Mother Supreme Valya Harkonnen (Emily Watson) has gone to in order to keep her ultimate plan in motion. However, Sister Francesca let <em>Kotaku</em> know her influence is deeper than what we might see on screen. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197298" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the episode, we discover that Sister Francesca is mother to the petulantly horny son of Emperor Javicco Corrino (Mark Strong) when she mysteriously appears at the palace unannounced. We later find out that her son, Constantine (Josh Heuston), didn’t send a message to her requesting her presence as she believed, but instead it was Valya who surreptitiously summoned her without informing her that a fellow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-desmond-hart-pruwet-richese-1851700621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-desmond-hart-pruwet-richese-1851700621">Bene Gesserit</a></span>—Kasha (Jihae)—had been killed. After Valya catches her up on the Sisterhood losing its hold on the royal palace with Emperor Corrino refusing to have a Truthsayers, Francesca returns to sway Emperor Corrino in favor of appointing Constantine as the leader of his new fleet, without him knowing he was being manipulated to do so.</p><p>However, Valya doesn’t simply order Francesca to do so with the Voice or with threats, but rather by appealing to Francesca’s love of her son. Francesca is the trump card she’s playing now that her previous attempts to remind Emperor Corrino of the order’s influence on him have backfired. Remember, Valya’s ultimate plan is to have Emperor Corrino’s daughter Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) study to become a Bene Gesserit so that the Sisterhood can have one of their own sitting on the throne of the Imperium to protect them from any impending trouble. For an unspecified (but clearly lengthy) period of time, Francesca wasn’t able to be around Constantine. Speaking with <em>Kotaku</em>, Tabu says she thinks that is what underscores the character’s hidden power.  </p><p> “I think she was purposely kept away from the son because for Valya, it could have been dangerous if Francesca was lurking around in the palace. Francesca has a very powerful position if she wants to utilize it. She can play her take-the-son card anytime she wants because  he is the natural heir to the to the throne.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>She reasons that Francesca was kept away so “she does not become powerful, put her son on the throne, and turn against Valya.” Judging by the way Emperor Corrino nearly leapt on her in a moment of passion the minute he saw her, Francesca has a strong hold on his heart, which means she can control him. Her mere suggestion that the Emperor give his son more responsibility was enough to lead him to appoint Constantine the leader of his new fleet. If she’d been around during her son’s upbringing, who’s to say Francesca couldn’t have swayed Javicco to let Constantine be the next leader of the Imperium?</p><p>That question becomes harder to answer when you factor in how she refuses the Emperor’s romantic advances in the beginning of the episode, before submitting to them near the end. This could easily be looked at as typical Bene Gesserit sexual manipulation. However, the woman who plays Sister Francesca doesn’t think it’s so easy to determine. “She says she does not want to come between him and his wife, but she has very strong feelings for the emperor. She also wants to secure a place for her son,” she explains. “I don’t think she was just playing him for the sake of the Bene Gesserit.”</p><p>No Bene Gesserit is more closely tied to the throne than Francesca, which makes her one of the most powerful members of the sisterhood on the show in terms of influence. We’ll have to wait until the final episode to see if that influence helps or hurts Valya in the end. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-wants-to-change-the-%E2%80%98far-cry-formula%E2%80%99-with-far-cry-7-and-maverick.1062879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming had several reports on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry series throughout the year.</a> Notably, the Far Cry series currently has two games in development, which were both originally under the same game and codenamed Talisker. Its next mainline title is now under the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codename Blackbird</a>, and an extraction-based shooter is under the codename Maverick. Both games are still in development at the time of writing, but their release dates have been pushed back internally from 2025 to 2026 due to complexities in development.</p>



<p>Moving from Dunia to Snowdrop and under development at Ubisoft Montreal, both games are set to move away from the ‘Far Cry formula’. Maverick, which takes place in the Alaskan wilderness, will see players fight one another, animals, and the harsh weather to survive. On the flip side, Blackbird will now see the player have to rescue his family (NOT played by Cillian Murphy), who have been kidnapped by a conspiracy cult who have been performing hallucinogenic experiments on animals and children. It’s said that the player has 24 real-life hours (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, and the timer is reflected in-game by the player wearing a watch on his wrist.</p>



<p>But it isn’t just the gameplay loop of both games changing. It’s understood that both games have had a significant overhaul to their movement systems, too, including the addition of tactical spriting, sliding, vaulting, and more. Seemingly, this is due to both projects originating from the same game and sharing similar movement mechanics, with the similarities of both games bleeding into one another. Other aspects, including the inventory system and looting, also appear to bleed from the extraction-based shooter into Blackbird, too, with sources outlining that it doesn’t affect the mainline entry. “I’d argue it makes a lot of sense given your desperation to rescue your family,” said one source when asked.</p>



<p>Internally, Ubisoft Montreal and its supporting studios on Blackbird are optimistic, but some concerns over Maverick and its future loom given recent events at the publisher. Ubisoft has been attempting to do a Far Cry multiplayer for the best part of a decade, and while an extraction shooter could make a lot of sense for the Far Cry universe, it was ultimately greenlit to chase trends, and the genre doesn’t seem to have attracted the player’s numbers that the industry thought it would. </p>



<p>Defiant’s recent cancellation and subsequent layoffs felt like the beginning of a downward spiral, said some staff, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=yves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yves’ internal memo</a> following the announcement of its cancellation not inspiring much confidence in those already unsure about their project’s future.</p>



<p>For now, though, Ubisoft is seemingly trying to break its own trend of chasing trends, and Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’s called) and Maverick seems to be a step in the right direction, albeit a considerable risk. </p>

<p>Throughout the entirety of 2024, it was a three-horse race to see who would be the best of the best Counter-Strike 2 players in the world. Three superstars, two of which are still in their teens, put up dominant performances during the most prestigious CS2 events all year.</p>



<p>By the end of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and thus the 2024 CS2 calendar, one name stood the tallest amongst the best CS2 players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-of-2024">Best CS2 Players of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Thanks to a historic performance at the Shanghai Major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/">culminating in his first Major trophy</a>, Team Spirit’s 17-year-old donk is the unquestionable best CS2 player of 2024. In Shanghai, donk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/">posted the highest ever player rating at a Major ever</a> while becoming the youngest MVP ever. Donk’s mastery of crosshair placement, crouching, and the “donk slide” combined with his utmost confidence has been nearly unbeatable all year. And he’s just getting started.</p>



<h3 id="h-ilya-m0nesy-osipov">Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another special young talent that dominated 2024 is G2’s star AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov. After a breakout 2023, m0NESY showed no signs of slowing down, and is still the most lethal player in the world with the AWP in his hands. He has amazing aim and reaction speeds, but also the game sense of a veteran. Even though the AWP is the most dangerous tool in his arsenal, he can also produce highlights or clutches with a rifle if pressed to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mathieu-zywoo-herbaut">Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>ZywOo feels like the elder statesman when comparing him to actual teenagers like donk and m0NESY. But the prodigy and multi-time HLTV Player of the Year winner is still one of the best Counter-Strike players of the year. He put up nearly identical numbers as his younger adversaries <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at big events</a> all year, and has grown more dangerous with the rifles after dominating with the AWP earlier in his career. He always delivers in big moments for Team Vitality, and the guy who’s been dominating Counter-Strike for half a decade is still only 24 years old.</p>



<p>Which of these three deserves to be called the very best CS2 player of 2024? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ps-placeable-the-adorable-mod-that-turns-a-playstation-portable-into-a-console/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Sony launched the PlayStation Portable almost exactly 20 years ago, the value proposition was right there in the name: a PlayStation, but portable. But now modders have flipped that, introducing a PSP that can be played on a TV, console-style, and they've dubbed it the <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/">PS Placeable</a>.</p>
<p>It's a non-destructive mod to PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 systems that allows you to play PSP games on the TV off the original UMD physical media format, with a wireless controller like the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4—all wrapped in a miniature, PlayStation 2-like enclosure.</p>
<p>Let's be frank: One of the main reasons this thing gets special attention here is that its look is both clever and, well, kind of adorable. The miniaturization of the retro styling of the PlayStation 2 is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Of course, there have long been other ways to play some PSP games on the big screen—but there has always been one downside or another.</p>
<p>For example, you could connect the original PSP to a TV with convoluted cables, but you would then have to use that tethered handheld as your controller.</p>
<p>Much later, the PlayStation TV set-top box made by Sony itself was essentially a console-style take on the PlayStation Vita, and like the Vita, it could play numerous classic PSP games—plus, it supported wireless controllers—but it didn't support most PSP games, and it only worked with those downloaded through Sony's digital store.</p>

In-universe, the Illuminate had over a century to make their plans to invade Super Earth, but the players have already repelled the invasion in just under a week.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/it-was-down-to-the-wire-but-helldivers-2-players-are-celebrating-after-giving-the-illuminate-the-galactic-boot-on-calypso-though-ive-got-a-feeling-theyll-be-back-soon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, over 100,000 players checked in with Helldivers 2 over a 24-hour period, the game's highest numbers since April. And the combined forces expelled the Illuminate so thoroughly that this previously feared foe is now the subject of mockery by the triumphant players.</p><p>The same account noted that the fight against the Illuminate at Calypso was also one of the bloodiest battles in the game's history.</p><p>As this meme points out, the victory over the Illuminate came by a very thin margin, and only because so many players were active. A second wave of the invasion may be a different story, especially if the players can't marshal all of their forces.</p><p>Earlier this year, Arrowhead mapped out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-director-outlines-plan-to-fix-the-game/1100-6525789/" data-ref-id="1100-6525789">a 60-day plan</a> to fix some of Helldivers 2's lingering issues, many of which were addressed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-helldivers-2-patch-will-make-players-feel-more-powerful-bugs-much-squishier/1100-6526520/" data-ref-id="1100-6526520">in a patch that dropped in September</a>.

                <p>The 2000s called, and Capcom answered last week by unveiling new entries in the Okami and Onimusha series. But the company doesn't seem done yet with bringing back old franchises. In fact, Capcom states it's "focusing on reactivating dormant IPs" alongside brand-new titles going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">A Capcom press release highlighting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/okami-2-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528453/" data-ref-id="1100-6528453">the reveals of Okami 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-coming-in-2026-reviving-the-franchise-after-nearly-two-decades/1100-6528447/" data-ref-id="1100-6528447">Onimusha Way of the Sword at The Game Awards</a> offers insight into the publisher's plans for the future. "In addition to regularly releasing major new titles each year, Capcom is focusing on reactivating dormant IPs that haven't had a new title launch recently. The company is working to further enhance corporate value by leveraging its rich library of content, which includes reviving past IPs like [Okami 2 and Onimusha Way of the Sword], in order to continuously produce highly efficient, high-quality titles."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSoZgCCxyQc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mSoZgCCxyQc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Okami 2--referred as "Okami sequel project" by Capcom--will see the return of the original's director, with Hideki Kamiya. Okami originally launched for PS2 in 2006, and the series did get a follow-up in 2010 (2011 for North America) with Okamiden for Nintendo DS. There is no release window for the Okami sequel project.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Ominusha Way of the Sword is set to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It's the first new entry in the mainline series since 2006's Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams for PS2.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not necessarily new for Capcom to note that it's looking into old franchises to revisit, by the way. In 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-has-plans-to-utilize-dormant-franchises/1100-6470660/" data-ref-id="1100-6470660">Capcom discussed intentions to "utilize" dormant franchises</a>. In addition, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-hasnt-been-forgotten-capcom-insists/1100-6525220/" data-ref-id="1100-6525220">the company insisted Mega Man hasn't been forgotten</a>, meaning the Blue Bomber could possibly see a return alongside Okami in the years ahead.</p>

<p>I grew up playing Ghost Recon alongside one of my older brothers, and it was my go-to tactical shooter for the longest time. As such, when the franchise began to modernize, I certainly couldn’t stay away. After all, realistic tactics, weapon customization, and full co-op were too good to pass up. But something was missing from the Steam release. It’s no longer a problem, as you can now unlock all of the Steam Achievements in Ghost Recon Breakpoint as of December 16!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-steam-achievements-in-ghost-recon-breakpoint">All Steam Achievements in Ghost Recon Breakpoint</h2>



<p>Don’t expect too many for the third-person tactical shooter from Ubisoft. Ghost Recon Breakpoint features 50 Steam Achievements, the majority of which stem from single-player objectives and story beats, such as completing specific acts or tackling unique challenges, such as slaying a particular number of Wolves.</p>

<p>Following a tumultuous launch, Assassin’s Creed Unity wound up becoming a fan-favorite for its unique setting and style, with a focus on multiplayer stealth over previous entries in the franchise. But there was one thing sorely missing from the Steam release: Achievements. Well, Ubisoft is fixing that now. On December 16, it added Steam Achievements to Asassin’s Creed Unity, Black Flag, and Ghost Recon Wildlands!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-steam-achievements-in-assassin-s-creed-unity">All Steam Achievements in Assassin’s Creed Unity</h2>



<p>Like with a few of the other titles receiving achievements from Ubisoft, Assassin’s Creed Unity features a total of 57 for you to unlock, should you wish to go back and 100% the game. Most of them revolve around the main story, a few for the co-op mode, and plenty for side content. </p>

Like other Hazelight-developed games, Split Fiction is a two-player co-op experience, and both players will get to master various abilities as they work their way through each level. There are also optional side stories to dive into, based on stories from Zoe and Mio's pasts that they worked on as kids or teens or started in adulthood but never finished.

The free-to-play third-person hero shooter has quickly become one of the biggest games of the year, with hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day, just on Steam alone. And now, just a few weeks after launch, developer NetEase has announced the first major in-game event for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and as you might expect, it’s Christmas-themed. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 16, NetEase released a trailer</a></span> for “The Winter Celebration,” a new update arriving on all platforms.

That trailer contains four Jeff the Landsharks fighting four other Jeffs in a mode that seems tailored to annoy people who hate this tiny healer. Meanwhile, as someone who loves Jeff and plays with him a lot, I’m very excited about this new mode and Jeff’s adorable ski outfit. </p><p>Interestingly, this new limited-time holiday mode looks to basically be a knock-off version of Nintendo’s <em>Splatoon</em>. Four Jeffs take on four other Jeffs to spray snow across the map and try to cover as much of it as they can before the time runs out. So it looks like NetEase is willing to pull from other games beyond <em>Overwatch </em>for “inspiration.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mun who ends up stranded on a planet called Sempiria. Communication with the planet has been dark for over 600 years, and no one has left its orbit in all that time. Jordan goes to Sempiria in search of members of the Five Aces crime syndicate, apparently because she’s in desperate need of the bounty. They seemingly have history, as in Jordan’s ship, we see a photo of her and what appears to be other members of the group, though the specifics of her relationship with them are unconfirmed. Once she reaches the planet’s surface, she’s faced by hostile robots and likely other dangers.</p><p>That’s the gist of what we know of the main plot, but as far as the larger world of <em>Intergalactic</em>, director Neil Druckmann explained to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span><em> </em>that Jordan’s story will also include some kind of fictional religion at the center and explore “what happens when you put your faith in different institutions.” Druckmann also said that <em>Intergalactic </em>takes place in an alternate future in which space travel had become pretty advanced by the 1980s. That’s why you’ll notice several retrofuturistic elements in Jordan’s space ship, including a CD player on which she spins “It’s a Sin” by the Pet Shop Boys and a CRT television on which she watches anime.</p><p><em>Intergalactic</em>’s reveal trailer definitely feels like it’s cut from the same cloth as <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em> in terms of being a “prestige” cinematic story-driven game, and Druckmann says much of the team’s inspiration came from anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. Fans have even noted that some details in the trailer appear to be homages to <em>Akira</em>, from Jordan’s red jacket to the CD player in her ship.</p><h2 id="h19101"><a id=""></a><strong>Who’s involved?</strong></h2><p>While we only know the broad strokes of the game’s story and haven’t seen any actual gameplay yet, we do know a fair number of the key personnel attached to <em>Intergalactic</em>. Druckmann is the creative director after leading both <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <em>Uncharted 4</em>, with Naughty Dog veterans Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau both acting as game directors.</p><p>Jordan is played by actor Tati Gabrielle, who Naughty Dog fans may recognize from her role in the <em>Uncharted </em>movie as mercenary leader Jo Braddock, a character who kinda felt like a stand-in for <em>Uncharted 4</em> and <em>Lost Legacy</em>’s antagonist-turned-ally Nadine Ross. By the time <em>Intergalactic </em>is out, fans will likely be even more acquainted with her, as she plays Nora in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ upcoming second season.</p><p>Outside of Gabrielle, we know a few other actors who will make an appearance in <em>Intergalactic</em>. Halley Gross, the co-writer and narrative lead on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, will play AJ, Jordan’s agent, as seen in the announcement trailer. <em>The Big Sick </em>and <em>Eternals </em>actor Kumail Nanjiani will appear as Colin Graves, one of the Five Aces Jordan is hunting. <em>Better Call Saul </em>actor Tony Dalton is also playing a member of the Five Aces, but the character’s name is unknown right now. Troy Baker, who plays Joel in <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044">James in the HBO series</a></span>, is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293">confirmed to play a character in <em>Intergalactic</em></a></span>.</p><p>Lastly, the duo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are composing music for the game. The two have written countless scores for films over the years, with some recent standouts including <em>Challengers </em>and <em>Queer</em>. This marks their first time working on a video game score together.</p><h2 id="h19102"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s the plan for the future?</strong></h2><p>Druckmann told <em>The New York Times</em> that Naughty Dog had been restructured as “an IP powerhouse” following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">layoffs</a></span> over the past year, and the studio is aiming for <em>Intergalactic </em>to become a big new franchise for PlayStation. Whether or not that comes to pass will depend on how the first game does, but given Sony’s propensity to milk games for spin-offs and external media, I wouldn’t doubt that Sony wants <em>Intergalactic </em>to spawn sequels and maybe some TV or movie adaptations. Naughty Dog is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presenting the game as a “franchise”</a></span> in its official announcement, so it sounds like expectations for this one are pretty high. We’ll see how it all pans out at some point in the coming months or years, as right now we don’t know when <em>Intergalactic </em>will actually make its way to our PlayStation 5s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-fantasy-16-collaboration-has-roots-that-go-back-decades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Back around Tekken 3, a lot of our staff left the team and actually went to Square”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fitting that in the year of the 30th anniversary of the original PlayStation, two of the console’s biggest franchises — Tekken and Final Fantasy — are collaborating once more. The two names are nearly synonymous with the PlayStation brand, and more than that share a development history not many know about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess we can talk about [it] now since so much time has passed. Back around Tekken 3, a lot of our staff left the team and actually went to Square,” Tekken executive producer Katsuhiro Harada reveals in a sit down interview with IGN. Given Tekken 3 was in development during 1995 and released a year later, there were likely several ex-Tekken staff lending their 3D development skills to what would likely have been the only Final Fantasy game in production around then: the seminal PlayStation RPG, Final Fantasy 7.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/24/ff7-blogroll-1729792643317.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Final Fantasy 7</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re both titles that were synonymous with PlayStation and also the kind of high-level 3D graphics [both series had] at the time were similar,” Harada continues. “And although we were making different games at that point, [the ex-Tekken developers] were still our friends and people we worked really closely with. So [at the time I thought] it would be interesting if we could work together again sometime in the future. It just turned out that it took a lot more time than I initially thought.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here we are, decades later and the Tekken and Final Fantasy brands are going head-to-head on friendlier terms. Clive Rosfield, the protagonist of Final Fantasy 16, will be the latest guest character joining the Tekken roster. He’s only the second Final Fantasy character to ever join Tekken, following after Final Fantasy 15’s Noctis, who made an appearance in Tekken 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might be surprised to hear that this collaboration between Final Fantasy 16 and Tekken 8 began much earlier than expected. So early, in fact, that Final Fantasy 16 was still in the middle of development when Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada reached out to FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida about a potential collaboration. Yoshida invited Harada and Tekken 8 director Kohei Ikeda to Square Enix to play an in-development build of the game and the foundations were laid for the crossover.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by the team responsible for the massively popular Final Fantasy 14 MMORPG, Final Fantasy 16 is a stark departure for the series as far as gameplay goes, eschewing any kind of turn-based combat in favor of real-time action where Clive can wield his sword and chain combos together. Final Fantasy 16’s more action-forward direction meant that Clive could fit seamlessly into Tekken. His combo-heavy attacks and ability to channel the powers of different “Eikons” — powerful familiars like Ifrit, Phoenix, and Titan — ensures a fairly diverse kit for his Tekken 8 appearance..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to make sure that all of the Eikons were available in some way while playing [as Clive in Tekken 8],” says Ikeda. Expect to see Clive use various elemental abilities such as wind, lightning, ice, fire, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While fans of Final Fantasy 16 will find Clive has access to a lot of the same abilities in Tekken as he does in his own game, there were some changes made to the character. Namely, his character model.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The director of the Final Fantasy team told us that he would like us to adjust Clive’s frame a bit because our characters are quite beefy,” Ikeda recalls. “So we did adjust his legs and lower body to make him more in line with our fighters when they’re both on the same screen at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Clive hit the gym for Tekken, but in payment for those new pecs he did have to make some sacrifices elsewhere. “It’s funny that although he’s gotten more muscular, his sword has shrunk in size because in a fighting game, it would give him way too much of an advantage if the sword was as big as it is in the original game,” Harada adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I guess that means no chance of Cloud and his colossal Buster Sword joining Tekken, then? Well, don’t think so fast. According to Harada, the Tekken team is not limited to just one character from Final Fantasy. He says it “might be cool if we had two,” but for now it’s not something in the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been quite the journey to see games like Tekken and Final Fantasy evolve alongside each other, and now to see them crossover like this. While neither franchises are strictly exclusive to PlayStation anymore, their association with the brand means both Tekken and Final Fantasy feature prominently in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time">Top 100 PlayStation Games of All Time list</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So of course we had to ask the Tekken developers: “What is your favorite Final Fantasy video game?”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/tekken8finalfantasy16cliverosfieldtrailerthegameawards-ign-blogroll-1734056681569.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“I actually learned Japanese by playing through the Japanese version of Final Fantasy 7. I think my girlfriend at the time hated me for asking me so many questions about stuff,” joked producer Michael Murray. “But if I had to pick one with memories and everything involved, it’s probably [Final Fantasy] 11 because I think it was around Tekken 4 everyone on the team would wake up early and not go to work yet and we’d meet up online in FF11 and play for a bit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Tekken 8 director Ikeda, he says his favorite is Final Fantasy 4 as he enjoyed feeling the series change to be “more narrative-based. It followed the main character Cecil and his transition from the Dark Knight to a paladin.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Harada, Final Fantasy 4 is also a favorite but, from a personal perspective, there’s just no comparison to the iconic entry: Final Fantasy 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s so many scenes in the game I can still remember to this day,” Harada says. Perhaps his colleagues working on that title helped make that connection feel even stronger, and being able to return the favor with Clive in Final Fantasy XVI is thanks for those memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

                <p>Visions of Mana arrived earlier this, marking the first time in 15 years we've seen a new mainline game in the Mana series. Though it launched to mixed reviews, it’s been a relative hit with longtime fans thanks to its unique watercolor-like graphics and an engaging class system that offers a variety of playstyles. If you were on the fence about the game, now is a good time to finally dive in, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ73WDH8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/apee40qsp8hn6?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17343670725912?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fvisions-of-mana---playstation-5%2F403506.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fvisions-of-mana-is-just-40-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x%2F1100-6528498%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> are all offering it for $40 (was $70).

Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/visions-of-mana-review-limited-tunnel-vision/1900-6418272/" data-target="true">Visions of Mana review</a> found the storyline to be rather lackluster, but the game’s vibrant graphics are easy on the eyes and make the adventure feel like a living watercolor painting. You’ll engage in fast-paced battles throughout your journey and encounter a variety of enemies--and at just $40, now is the ideal time to finally check out the first mainline Mana title in 15 years.</p>                      </div><p>Most locations can get the game in their hands before Christmas, though be sure to double-check your arrival dates after entering your shipping details.</p><p>If you’re looking for a PS5 version, your best option is to buy it directly from Amazon, as it comes with an <strong>exclusive sticker set</strong>. If you’re shopping for Xbox Series X, however, you’ll find it listed for $45 on Amazon. Instead, check out Best Buy, which is offering both PS5 and Xbox Series X versions for just $40.</p><p>GameStop also has the games listed at a discount--but since you’ll need to pay for shipping unless you spend $79, only shop here if you can opt for in-store pickup.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-holiday-premium-collection-gets-big-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Holiday Premium Collection Gets Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-get-big-discounts-new-chroma-model-for-only-54-at-amazon/1100-6527935/">DualSense PS5 Controllers Get Big Discounts - New Chroma Model For Only $54 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/woot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds/1100-6528302/">Woot Has Over 40 Nintendo Switch Game Deals, Including Many Of The Best Exclusives And Rare Finds</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart/1100-6528276/">The Minecraft Creeper Mini Fridge Is On Sale For Only $29 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-metal-puzzles-restocked-at-amazon-still-on-sale-for-only-15/1100-6522395/">The Legend Of Zelda Metal Puzzles Restocked At Amazon - Still On Sale For Only $15</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/demon-slayer-blu-rays-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-swordsmith-village-arc-launched-today/1100-6526820/">Demon Slayer Blu-Rays Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Swordsmith Village Arc Launched Today</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Collector's Edition Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>   </ul> </div>
