            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Marvel Super Heroes set arrives next June, just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023"><em>Avengers</em> to return to theaters and <em>Doomsday</em></a> to debut at the end of the year. But the <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">licensed Universes Beyond expansions</a> have been at their best when they add more flavor to the trading card game rather than just lean on it for publicity. On Tuesday, Wizards of the Coast gave fans a taste of what to expect from the latest comic-book-inspired set, from Incredible Hulk card art to new Captain America card mechanics.</p> <p>The company teased 38 new cards on its <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/marvel-super-heroes-preview-prologue">latest WeeklyMTG show</a>. There’s plenty of Legendary Creatures, some neat spells, and lots of really nifty art. There’s Captain America, a 3/2 white creature with a shield counter that protects it from one instance of damage. There’s Bruce Banner, a 1/1 blue who can transform into the Hulk with an Enrage condition that gives him a +1/+1 counter when damaged and a second attack phase.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651829"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651829">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000651830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651830"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651830">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>And then there’s Doctor Doom, a 3/3 black creature that enters with Doombot tokens, lets players draw a card and take damage at the end of their turn, and is indestructible while an artifact creature or Plan is on the field. Wizards also revealed a notable reprint of Heroic Intervention, with the effect of “Permanents you control gain hexproof and indestructible until end of turn.” The set has a Horn of Greed, too, with the perfect Doctor Doom “toot” art.</p>

 <p>While the reprints each have callbacks to some classic Marvel comic book art, my favorite-looking cards so far are the full-art variants of Widow-Making Infiltrator, Dig Through Time, and Elektra, Deadly Assassin. And for all your Saga nerds out there, we have World War Hulk, which ends with doubling a creature’s power and toughness and giving it trample, and The Coming of Galactus, which culminates in a 16/16 black Elder Alien with flying, trample, and “Whenever Galactus attacks, destroy target land.”</p> <p>I wasn’t too impressed with the Marvel set when it was initially revealed earlier this year. Coming right after Spider-Man and in the midst of a glut of other Universes Beyond crossovers, it seemed likely to be another property stretched thin and rushed out to keep the release calendar rolling. These initial card reveals look promising, though. I’m intrigued. Maybe I wasn’t as burnt out on Marvel as I thought. I might just have to chase Galactus after all.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-pro-3-return-to-black-friday-record-low-on-amazon-apple-store-still-charges-full-price-2000651653</link>
            <guid>1377799</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never puts its newest products on sale, especially not something as new as the AirPods Pro 3 which came out just a few months ago. But Amazon has taken matters into its own hands and cut prices on almost all of Apple’s products right before Christmas. For instance, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">you can get these third-generation AirPods Pro for $219 instead of the usual $249</a> which is the same price as the lowest price we saw on Black Friday. You might be tempted to buy the older AirPods Pro 2 because they are cheaper, but this newer model has so many more features powered by Apple Intelligence that if you don’t upgrade, you’ll miss out on features that change the way you use wireless earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Efficient Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Apple says that the <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already-great Pro 2 model</strong> – and it means that subway rumble, airplane engine drone, and coffee shop chatter almost completely disappear. The active noise cancellation changes in real time based on the shape of your ear canal and the fit of the ear tips and keeps changing to keep out as much outside noise as possible. The <strong>box now comes with five different ear tip sizes</strong> instead of the three it used to have to make sure you can find a snug fit that makes the best seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>The audio architecture was completely changed to focus on what Apple calls <em>“three-dimensional sound,”</em> which makes music feel like it’s happening around you instead of inside your head. Bass hits with more depth and power without drowning out the midrange, and high frequencies give you clear detail that lets you hear each instrument in a complicated arrangement. The vocals are very clear and present, putting the singers right in front of you in the soundstage. When you turn your head, <strong>spatial audio with dynamic head tracking</strong> keeps sound sources anchored to your iPhone or iPad which makes for an immersive experience that is especially fun when watching movies or playing games.</p>



<p>One of the most useful new features of the AirPods Pro 3 is heart rate sensing: It turns your earbuds into workout partners that <strong>can track your heart rate and calorie burn for 50 different types of exercise</strong>. This information syncs with the Activity app on your iPhone, adding to your Move ring and step count. It also gives you useful information through the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p><em>Live Translation</em> uses Apple Intelligence to process speech and give instant translations that sound natural: This breaks down language barriers in real-time conversations. Think about going to another country and being able to talk to people there without having to pull out your phone or look for a translation app: The feature works with many languages and gets better as Apple Intelligence learns from more interactions. Active Hearing Protection keeps an eye on the noise levels in your environment all the time and it lowers the volume when you’re around sounds that could hurt your ears, like construction work, concerts, or loud traffic.</p>



<p>The Hearing Aid feature uses the great fit and noise processing to work as a clinical-grade hearing aid, complete with automatic Conversation Boost to boost speech frequencies. You can even use your iPhone and AirPods Pro 3 to take a hearing test at home which will give you personalized audio profiles that make listening to music, calls, and media more enjoyable. With active noise cancellation turned on, the battery lasts for eight hours and with Transparency mode and hearing aid functionality turned on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours.</p>
<p>It might not sound like much, but Apple products don’t usually go on sale this soon after they come out, so this price is very good by Apple’s standards. You can get flagship earbuds at a lower price before the holiday shopping season ends because Amazon matched the Black Friday record low in mid-December. You’re buying earbuds that work as fitness trackers, hearing aids, translation devices, and high-end audio equipment all in one package which makes the price worth it even before the discount is taken into account.</p>

            <guid>1377772</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And yeah, it's pretty cool.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-mysterious-the-game-awards-statue-reportedly-isnt-teasing-the-elder-scrolls-6-diablo-or-god-of-war-so-what-is-it-teasing">large, demonic-looking monolith appeared in the Mojave Desert</a>, and Geoff Keighley tweeted a photo of it. The monolith featured figures of all sorts of strange creators: skeletons, alligators, soldiers, a wolf, and more. In the time since, online gaming enthusiasts have been eagerly speculating as to what the monolith and Keighley were teasing ahead of The Game Awards. Diablo 4? The Elder Scrolls 6? God of War? Bloodborne 2? Altered Beast?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, the mystery may have been solved in advance of The Game Awards on Thursday. As <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by MP1st</a>, some newly registered trademarks reveal a game and a logo that looks essentially identical to a symbol on the monolith. And those trademarks appear to be for a new Divinity game, from Larian Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do we know? Well, let's take a look at <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the trademarks</a>. It's for an image, and it looks like this:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565fmr7unsbd5jsl4ttwopcumgrig-1765310322978.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now compare that to the big symbol at the center of the statue:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, that's definitely the same symbol, so we're in the right place. Now, how do we know it's Divinity? Let's look at <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the next trademark registered at the same time by the same company</a>, simply for "Divinity", with a logo attached.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565ezczz2ayw37cfdb5x3ebc6mn4y-1765310040065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're getting somewhere! It's not exact, but it's quite comparable to past Divinity: Original Sin logos:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/header-1765310670854.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/header-1-1765310692505.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And even closer to the older Divinity games, slashed through "i" and all.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/logo-divine-divinity-1-1765312473079.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/logo-beyond-divinity-1765312488383.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, maybe it's all just a big coincidence? Sure, I guess. But there's one more clue. All three trademarks were filed by Ihde &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte, a legal firm that, among other things, has previously filed trademarks for Larian Studios, including <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017931129" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">past Divinity: Original Sin trademarks</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that's pretty cut and dry. But what about that third trademark? This is where things get a bit more mysterious. This trademark is also just for an image, this one here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565gq2lboaqot2jsa6vx2cxeqx22a-1765310920328.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What's that? I have no idea. But it's probably related, given it was filed on the same day by the same firm and is in a similar style to the other trademarks. Maybe we'll find out on Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, this seems to be for a new Divinity...NOT a Divinity: Original Sin game. Director of publishing at Larian Studios Michael Douse was on Twitter/X today shutting down any rumors of a Divinity: Original Sin 3, but his language was very specific:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will 🙏</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If this is indeed Divinity, that's good news for Larian fans, as Divinity: Original Sin 2 was fantastic. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/21/divinity-original-sin-2-review">gave it a 9.6/10</a>, saying, "Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur’s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 3 is Larian's most recent work, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">got an impressive 10/10 from us</a>. We said, "I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3. Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense. But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from, this is absolutely it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some may have clamored for Larian to immediately get to work on DLC or Baldur's Gate 4, Larian explicitly said over a year ago that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">wouldn't be continuing with another D&amp;D game</a>. However, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029">teasing</a> a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">new project</a> for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-baldurs-gate-3-turns-2-larian-boss-swen-vincke-talks-about-the-studios-next-game-and-asks-fans-for-their-patience-well-need-a-bit-of-time-to-make-it-all-work">while now</a>, and based on past timelines, this year's Game Awards would be a perfect time for an unveiling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[McDonalds Got Bullied So Badly It Deleted Its AI Christmas Ad]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791</link>
            <guid>1377751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this month, McDonald’s Netherlands put out an ugly and lifeless Christmas commercial that was created using AI generation tools. Over the weekend, after the ad spot went viral online for all the wrong reasons, the fast-food chain deleted it.</p> <p>Recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/coca-cola-ai-tv-commerical-ad-coke-generated-holiday-1851700865">McDonald’s followed in the footsteps of Coca-Cola</a> and released <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1998108853444169807">a new AI-generated advertisement</a> just in time for the holiday season. The ad features numerous AI-generated scenes of people dealing with all the horrible, annoying, and not-so-great moments that can happen during this time of year. It’s genuinely a funny little idea for an ad, but it’s hard to watch and enjoy when it’s so clearly AI-generated.</p>

 <p>This is normally the part where I’d embed the ad via an official source, like the McDonald’s YouTube account. But, <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial">as spotted by <em>Futurism</em></a>, I can’t do that because the fast food company has seemingly removed it entirely from the internet, a step it took after previously shutting down comments on the ad. So here’s a reupload of it via the YouTube channel CongenAI:</p>

  <p>Perhaps the wildest part of all of this is that the studio behind the awful-looking AI ad claimed that it crunched for weeks to produce this slop. Seriously. <a href="https://80.lv/articles/mcdonald-s-unveils-an-ai-generated-christmas-ad-that-somehow-looks-worse-than-coca-cola-s">Here’s the full statement</a> from the studio, <a href="https://lbbonline.com/news/McDonalds-Netherlands-AI-Terrible-Truth-of-December">Sweetshop</a>, which has also since been deleted:</p> <blockquote><p>“For seven weeks, we hardly slept, with up to 10 of our in-house AI and post specialists at The Gardening Club working in lockstep with the directors. Every shot travelled through a rigorously engineered toolchain: real Google Earth plates, advanced style-transfer, pixel-level photo repair, custom LoRAs, control nets, bespoke ComfyUI graphs, and thousands upon thousands of tightly steered iterations.</p> <p>Then came compositing, lighting balance, physics corrections, artefact removal, and final finishing in Flame. We generated what felt like dailies – thousands of takes – then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production. This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film. And here’s the thing I wish more people understood: magic isn’t the technology. The magic is the team behind it, people who pushed, questioned, experimented, swore at broken models, solved impossible problems, and refused to stop until every frame felt cinematic.</p> <p>I don’t see this spot as a novelty or a cute seasonal experiment. To me, it’s evidence of something much bigger: that when craft and technology meet with intention, they can create work that feels genuinely cinematic. So no – AI didn’t make this film. We did.”</p></blockquote> <p>Personally, I think it would be easier and better to just have a camera crew and a director film some actors, maybe add some stock footage in, and not make something horrible in a way that sounds both tedious and terrible. But I’m just old-fashioned like that, I guess.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Current Plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3, Larian Says]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Divinity series has been the talk of the town lately after it was uncovered that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue for The Game Awards</a> could be related to the 23-year-old franchise. One such hope from fans is that the announcement, should it be true, is that Divinity: Original Sin 3 is on the way.</p>



<p>If you’re one of those fans hoping for that, you may want to sit down.</p>







<p>While answering fan questions on social media, Laraian Studio’s head of publishing Michael Douse poured some sand on that fire—yes, sand is good to put out small fires. </p>



<p>In a response to <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan asking</a>, “Divinity Original Sin 3 when???”, Douse said there are no current plans for the game. However, he didn’t say there weren’t any plans for Divinity as a whole.</p>



<p><strong>“There aren’t currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game, but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,”</strong> he said. </p>







<p>While the new announcement may not be for Divinity: Original Sin 3, there remains plenty of smoke that Divinity will have a major presence at Thursday’s The Game Awards. Maybe even a new game titled something completely different, but in the series.</p>



<p>One rumor also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">making the rounds</a> is that Larian is set to announce Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition for PlayStation 5 and, possibly, Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Whether that’s the only announcement or something even bigger is planned, it feels like fans of Larian Studios will have something to talk about soon enough. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Alien Star In Talks to Star in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/</link>
            <guid>1377745</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, Sigourney Weaver may be in talks to star in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series. The Oscar-nominated actress, if confirmed, would join Game of Thrones’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>, who’s set to play protagonist Lara Croft.</p>



<p>Starting in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become a gaming icon, spawning multiple games, a reboot, and much more. It’s had three live-action films starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander. While a sequel to the 2018 film was cancelled, a new live-action adaptation of the iconic Tomb Raider series was announced by Prime Video <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>. With Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge as creator, writer, and executive producer, the show has set its sights on finally bringing the series to Hollywood successfully. Fortunately, if the latest casting is any indication, it could reach those lofty heights.</p>







<h2 id="h-sigourney-weaver-in-talks-for-prime-video-s-tomb-raider-series-starring-sophie-turner">Sigourney Weaver In Talks for Prime Video’s Tomb Raider Series Starring Sophie Turner</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/tomb-raider-tv-series-sigourney-weaver-1236636519/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report from Deadline</a>, actress <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong>, known for her work in Alien and Avatar, <strong>is in talks to star in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider</strong>. It’s not known if the Oscar-nominated actress will take the undisclosed role, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. If true, she would join Sophie Turner and All-American: Homecoming’s Martin Bobb-Semple, who was added last week.</p>



<p>If confirmed, Sigourney Weaver would be a major steal for the series. The actress has starred in multiple blockbusters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alien-isolation-2-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aliens</a>, Ghostbusters, Galaxy Quest, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-season-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar</a>. She has been nominated for three Academy Awards, two for Best Actress (Aliens and Gorillas in the Mist) and one for Best Supporting Actress (Working Girl). Furthermore, she is appearing in Avatar: Fire and Ash and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu in major roles.</p>



<p>Given how popular the Tomb Raider franchise is (and the already stacked cast and crew), it’s not a surprise to see Sigourney come on board. The future of the series is an exciting one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans will find out more</a> on December 11th at The Game Awards. Filming for the show is starting in February 2026, so more information may be revealed prior to starting. Until then, it’s certainly a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan.</p>

                <p>The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">numerous developers lost their jobs</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">Microsoft canceled games</a>, and the industry further consolidated with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry.</p><p>Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not. In any event, Keighley said walking the line between celebrating games and acknowledging current circumstances is no easy task.</p><p>"It's a very difficult needle to thread, because on one level, it is a celebration of the industry. But the games are made by incredible developers, and it’s been a challenging period overall. I don't have all the answers about the right way to [address it]."</p><p>Keighley went on to say he feels a "weight" on his shoulders to do more because The Game Awards has such a large platform. But at the same time, Keighley said he understands that people watch the show to see their favorite games get celebrated and get hyped for the news and reveals.</p><p>"How we square that is something that we think a lot about. Some people online think that we're oblivious to it. We're definitely thinking about the right way to represent the industry to the wider world. Do we always get it right? No. It's a very complex situation to figure out exactly what to do," he said.</p><p>People have also criticized The Game Awards (and numerous other entertainment awards shows, for that matter) for not being more heavily focused on the awards themselves, and instead also serving as a marketing events for games. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.</p><p>"There are many different constituents that tune in," he said. "And it is a balancing act. "There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements."</p><p>Keighley said his take is that the promise of exciting announcements help create a "very wide audience" for who might want to watch the show. More people watching to see the brand-new reveals--including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/" data-ref-id="1100-6536779">whatever the heck that scary monolith is</a>--will in turn create increased viewership for when the awards are handed out. Or at least that's how Keighley sees it and explains it, and he shared some anecdotes that back up his claims, to an extent.</p><p>"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people," he said. "Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right."</p><p>The Game Awards takes place on Thursday, December 11, beginning at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET, with a pre-show set to begin 30 minutes prior. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 picked up 12 nominations overall, including a nod for Game of the Year, and is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">most-nominated game in the history of the show</a>.</p><p>For more, check out all the categories and nominees below, along with our roundup of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025s-biggest-snubs/2900-7272/" data-ref-id="2900-7272">biggest snubs</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tga-2025-predictions-whats-going-to-happen-at-the-game-awards/2900-7307/" data-ref-id="2900-7307">predictions for what will be announced.</a></p>

                <p>After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the "must-play" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> was not mentioned.</p><p>Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, "Seeing Halo here is still surreal." Someone else said, "It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PlayStation 5 - Upcoming Games in 2026 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026.</p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to launch in Fall 2025 before the game was delayed to May 2026 and then again to November 2026. Rockstar has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">pattern of delaying games</a>, but nothing so far has suggested that Rockstar will delay GTA 6 a third time.</p><p>As for Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the original Halo game with modern graphics and numerous other updates and improvements, is set for release at some point in 2026 to mark the franchise's 25th anniversary. There are also rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">new live-service Halo game coming in 2026.</a></p><p>Other games featured in Sony's video include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pragmata/" data-ref-id="5000-513798">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/" data-ref-id="1100-6529491">Saros</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Nioh 3, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem.</a></p>

    <p>What does it take to raise three gargantuan, perfect boys? And what kind of crazy mix-ups would those beautiful, gentle giants get into? This is the central theme of <a href="https://joecappa.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Joe Cappa</a>’s <em>Haha, You Clowns</em>, possibly the strangest show in the last year and one of the strongest animated works that Adult Swim has produced since <em>Smiling Friends</em>. Isaiah Colbert and Chris Person sat down and talked about what it takes to raise such wonderful sons.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSVwyN6Ox5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Haha, You Clowns | OFFICIAL TRAILER | October 19 | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I became aware of this because <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bakoon.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Bakoon</a> kept posting out of context clips of it. How did you end up finding out about this?</p><figure><figcaption><span>What a bunch of pranksters. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> My first brush with it was a bit less happenstance. What with me being a cat in both worlds of gaming and animation, I wound up getting sent screeners of the show prior to its release in my emails.&nbsp; An occurrence that's usually random AF and results in me getting spammed with Prime Video shows no one's ever heard of and I will never watch, but I was taken aback by how its character designs all looked like palatable Wojack memes. But, turns out, it’s quite the opposite of that. It's pretty damn pleasant. Downright wholesome. </p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I love these boys so much.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The boys game. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> The elevator pitch for it is pretty much what you said, so it’s almost hard to describe the show beyond that. But if I were to attempt to do so, I'd say the show is about a family who lifts strangers up as often as they do each other as they learn to live together following the loss of their mom. Granted, it's a surreal-looking show to experience watching, with its characters looking like they wandered out of an MS Paint draft, but its humor is starkly anti-cynical. I think that's the magic of the whole thing.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, it's a hard show to explain the premise of without just watching it. I tried showing my dad this show over Thanksgiving. “It’s about three giant boys and their father and looks really troubling. You keep expecting something very bad to happen but if it does it's immediately resolved. By the end of every episode, they all learn a lesson and grow closer.” We watched exactly one episode, my dad laughed, and he said “OK, enough of that.” In retrospect, I was just describing a sitcom.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sometimes things get serious. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Basically, yet I think its look being so off-putting is what's kept it from really being an easy on-ramp show to get folks to watch. When I broach watching it with my friends after twisting their arm to rewatch specific <em>Smiling Friends</em> episodes at my request, they get turned off by the look of it. But after showing my partner the three episodes stretch from episodes 3-5, I think that's when its formula broke my partner down into liking it. In a weird way, the show having swole dudes who look like the friends of a friend you don't want to hang out with at a party acts as a way to deconstruct implicit biases. That even meatheads can be sweet boys. And seeing them make a mountain out of the smallest thing–searching for a lost jacket in a restaurant, comforting their dad on a rocky flight, teaching their younger brother to not be afraid of holding a baby–is almost an act of anti-comedy that comes back around as comedy when put against how intentionally weird looking the show is. It grows on you.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Oh my gawd. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p>Boo to all those people on Twitter that shat on the show for airing after <em>Smiling Friends</em> as if it were some Walmart double feature movie package deal that nobody wanted. I think they complement each other well, what with one being meaner despite its name and the other being wholesome despite how bowling shoe ugly its designs are.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Right, and the execution is the point. If you have to pinpoint what is "funny" about the show, it's often just how specific actions are animated or just tiny, uncomfortable turns of phrases. Tristan, Preston and Duncan are all voiced by Joe Cappa and have a diction somewhere between Schwarzenegger and Homestar Runner. I actually think it bizarrely shares a lot in common with the latter, as well as Brad Neely's work or maybe <em>Achewood</em> a little. There's an entire episode about Duncan being afraid of holding a baby that destroyed me just based on single, tiny shots of how strange babies look. Or even just the fact that their neighbor is professional pool player Jeanette "Black Widow" Lee, who is dating Sean Astin. It's just these specific beats in an otherwise wholesome show.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Biblically accurate Sean Astin had me rolling. They got his eye tilt so dead-on from all angles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It's cool that both Lee and Astin signed on for this knowing what it looks like.</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's Sean Astin, he starred in </span><i><em>Rudy</em></i><span>. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> I think another thing that probably Adult Swim should get more credit for is that many of its newer animated shows are from folks who just did animation on Newgrounds and YouTube for years as folks to take a chance on to give them these series. Cappa and <em>Smiling Friends</em> creators Michael Cusack and Zach Hadel are so terminally online have done this as a passion for so long that it really shows in their series. That uncanny ability to spotlight how drawing something like giving your dad a massage or naturalistic, rambling dialogue about something so innocuous and random like male-pattern balding and finding humor in how relatable that kind of banter is.</p><p>A secret thing I've been doing in the lag time of new episodes is going back to the creators' old stuff and discovering the genesis for what would be their first drafts of these jokes. For Hadel, a lot of it is random appearances on Oneyplays where his hypothetical inferences, vocal stims, and impersonations find new life in the show. The same can be said for Cappa, because the first drafts of <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> exist on his YouTube account. And honestly, the first one I saw I didn't like as much because it was a bit crass and mean spirited from the good boys I know and love. So witnessing that evolve into the wholesome show it is now has been a great thing to retroactively experience. It's kind of like how a mangaka will have the core premise of their landmark series in a one shot and seeing how relationships and designs carry over and are remixed for the better. Though, I did get a kick out of the YouTube series' running gag being that the mom was, in fact, a ghostly presence instead of being a knockoff Alexa.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lndui2TOza0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="HALLOWEEN EP"></iframe></figure><p>Though I'll take their eyes turning red whenever they inevitably start crying and the after school-ass <em>Yakuza</em> substory piano music that starts playing over it any day of the week.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1w8rgEZQMvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="HAHA, YOU CLOWNS - EP6: VR"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I think the final show works better because it firmly loves the boys. I remember someone a while back saying the difference between <em>Family Guy</em> and <em>American Dad</em> is that the family in <em>American Dad</em> seems to really like each other and that's why it's a better show. Like it really does grow on you. Cappa's entire account is wild though, his stuff involving really weird practical effects like “Meet The Boys” is great.

</figure><p>With <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> being the first Adult Swim short to be picked up as a series, I hope it leads more shows of its ilk to get a rocket strapped to its pack and propelled into the mainstream. My kingdom for a full series-funded pick up for YouTube animated shows like Speedoru's <em>Punch Punch Forever</em> or <em>MeatCanyon</em> getting some sort of show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I would very much love it if Adult Swim had free rein to do that. It exists as this strange unicorn when so much of animation is decimated, and it's worrying particularly since Williams Street is a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Lord knows, Warner Bros. under Netflix would all but assure nothing is getting past a second season. Good news for that “why bother?” Hogwarts show. Bad news for animation worth a damn.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I can't imagine that. I want these large lads to have a healthy life. I want to see their adventures for years. I wanna grow old with these beautiful boys.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> forever. A hundred years, <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> things, and stuff of that nature.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure>

            <p>The world's ended, but doesn't it look pretty? That seems to be the central premise of Verdant, a game in which a young bloke dirt bikes around the plant-filled remains of post-apocalyptic 1980s Germany, figuring out the conundrums all young dirt bikers face.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As someone who loves a good game about lone youngsters with big backpacks venturing into the unknown, the blend of soothing, flowery nature and darker undertones - as skeletons sit in abandoned cars - that Verdant offers really intrigues me. It seems there'll be as much chill camping amid runs as there is poking the barrel of your gun into hidden nooks, trying to work out what the heck turned the place into one big garden centre. The soundtrack's a charming blend of tinkly piano interspersed with bursts of synth, a contrast I also dig.</p>
<p>German devs Tiny Roar also emphasise, in their synopsis, that Verdant is as much about its dirt biker finding where they fit in the world's future as it is about dredging through the past. And touching deer, so they get even more plant-encusted. Hopefully there'll be plenty of depth to all these elements, rather than just surface-level emoting.</p>
<p>The biggest question I'm left with, following the reveal during today's Wholesome Snack showcase, is just how big Verdant's environment will feel as you're roaming around it. While actually having massive scale isn't necessary, maintaining the illusion that you're just a small speck amid a giant ocean of unknown possibility or threat is what makes the likes of similar backpackish youngster adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kill-this-tractor-so-you-wont-have-to-awkwardly-ring-your-parents-keep-drivings-tyres-squeal">Keep Driving</a> tick.</p>
<p>You're just a little dude, sitting in a car or at a campsite, surrounded by the whole. It's your puzzle, or your cage, or your playhouse. Usually all three at various times.</p>
<p>As of right now, Verdant is without a release date, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162340">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <p>Pay up then. Sorry, I've been sent on behalf of The Yolf, a giant horned cat creature who sits on a branch demanding payment in Mandrake. This folklore-infused gardening sim from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallen-london">Fallen London</a> devs Failbetter games has just had a fresh outing at today's Wholesome Snack showcase, putting centre-stage the The Yolf's need for you to get your affairs in order.</p>

<p>You play a farmer keen to do some gardening, despite curses and weird folkloric beings making that a bit harder. The Yolf, Failbetter say, lives next door. He's a "furry, friendly neighbour who nonetheless demands payment for debts owed to him by your ancestors". He'll only take cash for this sum of 962 gold crowns, as well.</p>
<p>To make that up, you'll have to get your sorcerer bottom in gear and plant some stuff. The game has goose trees, they sound like a good bet, especially if they turn out to be golden. You can also go foraging, fishing, and mining in "a world of old, wild powers, of uncanny spirits that reside in those places mortals dare not go; of deep histories, and deeper mysteries". It seems the more dangerous uncanny beings only come out at night, with the game warning you about going out once the sun sets.</p><p>The thing that's most intrigued me, aside from the gorgeously vibrant art style, is the chance to run around the sleepy rural hollow of Chandley having chats with people, spirits, gods, and bogles via dialogue boxes that remind me of a laid-back version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s portrait-side word scrawls. Then again, Failbetter also say you can do the following, all of which sounds rad: "Befriend a river. Eavesdrop on the dead. Spend a haunted night at the Butcher's Oak. Drink tea with the god who lives in your chimney."</p>
<p>Anyway, your job is to grow produce and redecorate the old mandrake lodge you'll be calling home. There's no cannibalism involved, or so the devs say.</p>
<p>Mandrake's still release-dateless as of right now, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710210/Mandrake/">Steam</a>. If you're keen for a long read outlining how it came to be and the path it's been on to this point, I'll point you to this piece former RPSer Alice B penned for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/leaving-fallen-london-how-failbetter-games-spent-several-years-growing-hope-and-discovering-the-art-of-the-possible-in-their-new-eldritch-farming-sim/">Perfectly Cylindical Gamer</a> upon its reveal this summer.</p>

      <p>Woe Industries, the same team behind <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-a-dark-souls-typing-game/" rel="noreferrer">the excellent <em>Souls t</em>yping game</a>, have a new release out this week, called <a href="https://woe-industries.itch.io/you-have-billions-invested-in-generative-ai?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>It's a short text adventure where you, a Silicon Valley Guy, have billions of dollars invested in generative AI. Which is putting you in regular contact with a cast of characters who, uh, just need to talk to you. Sometimes to warn you, other times to sign business deals that are totally cool and normal.</p><p>Whichever response you choose when prompted throughout these conversations, I'm sure everything is gonna turn out just fine.</p>
