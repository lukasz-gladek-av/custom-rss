While there was a moment where we thought we might have gotten a new Huntr/x banger that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrix-spotify-new-song-mazatlan-by-night-2000632680"><span>turned out to be a Spotify hack</span></a><span>, Netflix hasn’t put out any new music from the fictional K-pop group yet. What’s a Huntr/x fan to do other than listen to the soundtrack on loop? Well, Ejae, the singing voice of lead vocalist Rumi, has finally put out her own debut single, and yeah, the girl can sing even when she’s not slaying demons.</span></p> <p><span>“In Another World” is a ballad that sounds like something you’d hear over a Disney musical’s end credits. It’s definitely giving the late 2000s/early 2010s adult contemporary diva, along the lines of Leona Lewis and Adele, so don’t come expecting a Huntr/x-style banger here. All that said, the song is a vocal showcase for Ejae, who soars over its chorus as she sings of an estranged relationship that’s fallen through.

Ultimately, she discontinued her idol training to pursue a career as a songwriter. After working with groups like Red Velvet and&nbsp; Le Sserafim, she was brought onto </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> to write songs and record demos, then was asked to be Rumi’s singing voice in the final film.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the series’ earliest 2D entries, to Ryu's critically acclaimed foray into 3D, Ninja Gaiden has hacked and slashed its way to the top of the hyper-violent action games genre. And while countless ninja games have been released since the 1988 NES original, Ninja Gaiden still remains relevant nearly 40 years later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why is that? Let’s take a look back to when this series found its core game design DNA, with its early use of cinematics, narrative-driven gameplay, and innovation in difficult but rewarding challenges (not to mention, one of the sickest finishers ever in a video game.) From there, we’ll chart the course of Ninja Gaiden to see how it has kept its blade sharp over the decades, and why it remains one of the most influential action series of all time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Defining The Great Line</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The year is 1988. Arcades are a dominant force thanks to the likes of Double Dragon, Ghouls &amp; Ghosts, and Contra. These are all excellent games in their own right, but little did the world know that one of the most important ninja games of all time was about to be released. Ninja Ryūkenden, the game we in the western world now know as Ninja Gaiden (because, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100819051328/https://hg101.kontek.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden9.htm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the game’s art director</a>, “it sounded cool,”) launched with two dramatically different versions. The arcades saw a Double Dragon-inspired port, which while popular at the time, was dramatically different from the NES console version of Ninja Gaiden we would all come to know and love. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden was an unexpected revolution in action games. Overnight, it redefined what video games were capable of thanks to its difficult but gratifying combat, narrative-driven gameplay, and one of gaming’s first uses of cinematic cutscenes to tell its story. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninjagaiden-1760963315218.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The original Ninja Gaiden box art. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, you’d be hard-pressed to find a major release without some sort of cutscene or narrative break, with some even feeling more like interactive movies than video games. In the early days, though, this simply wasn't the case. The majority of games on the NES used a single static image with text and music to bookend a game's story, something you could only very loosely call a cutscene. Games like Castlevania or The Legend of Zelda, which featured stories that demanded more explanation, would require you to open up the manual and find it yourself, rather than find it in the game. And yes, while hardware was a limitation, that wasn’t the only reason. Western and Japanese versions of some NES games varied dramatically in narrative,  tone, and marketing. Such variations were due to the fact that, at the time, video games were still considered to be primarily for kids, which each territory’s version tweaked for their respective younger audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Ninja Gaiden’s goals was to change that. Developer Tecmo used a Hollywood blockbuster-like approach to elevate its storytelling for mature audiences. The game starts with a <a href="https://youtu.be/ueeKMQSS4bw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutscene of two ninjas</a> duelling to the death in a grassy moonlit field. Like a “big budget” movie, it utilized fast cuts, cinematic camera work, a widescreen aspect ratio, and expressive music to set up the death of Ryu’s father, the inciting incident that leads you on a game-long quest for revenge. Revenge narratives weren't new to video games, but that kind of cinematic setup sure was. In just a few seconds, we went from video games with little to no storytelling, to anime-inspired cutscenes and dialogue motivating you to complete your journey. This level of storytelling marked a major step forward in the perception of video games, proving they could be so much more than a child’s toy. Now, video games could also be an engaging platform to tell a captivating story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cutscenes, however, aren't the only thing that made Ninja Gaiden stand out all those years ago. Tecmo’s game design also made significant strides, and Ninja Gaiden proved to be uniquely challenging to gamers of the 8-bit generation. Instead of having to time jumps and memorize level layouts like in early Mega Man and Mario games, Gaiden’s high difficulty, high reward gameplay tied progression to skill development and a player’s ability to master the game’s combat mechanics.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninjagaiden-stage11-1760963708535.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja Gaiden had a fresh approach to difficulty, with enemies that would surprise attack from behind.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Ninja Gaiden, most “hard” games were purposefully designed to be challenging because it was an easy way to pad out the run time (or, in the case of the arcade, make sure our pockets were noticeably lighter when we left.) While some games, like early Mega Man, Castlevania, and Mario games, did demand a level of skill to beat, their difficulty was mostly based on level memorization. Ninja Gaiden was one of the first games to take the idea of high-challenge, high-reward and mould it into something enjoyable. You’re going to die a lot, but after enough frustrating failure (those dogs at the start of the game are no joke, and don't even get me started on the flying enemies in later stages) you’ll quickly find yourself playing with a mix of defensive dodging and aggressive strikes, and having a lot of fun while you do them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stage 1-1 is a masterclass in this philosophy, teaching players that challenge can be rewarding. The first stage in most games typically acts as a tutorial. Super Mario Bros. teaches players how to jump with little difficulty. Metroid forces the player to backtrack in order to gain the morphball ability, teaching players the necessity of exploration. And Sonic quickly demonstrates the need for speed. By immediately thrusting you into combat, Ninja Gaiden’s first level not only explains the game's core mechanic of kill or be killed, but also demonstrates that enemies can come from all directions, even behind you. The game's tutorial level is a trial by fire that teaches you to strike first and strike fast. That skill is continually reinforced throughout the game, requiring a lot more trial and error as things get progressively harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds familiar, doesn't it? While the first true “soulslike” game wouldn't be released for another 20+ years, it's not hard to see Gaiden's DNA in Demon’s Souls, Bloodborne, and every other soulsborne game since. This challenging and, at times, frustrating game design not only solidified Ninja Gaiden’s NES adventure as one of the 8-bit era’s best games, but also helped shape the next generation of Ryu’s adventures on the Game Boy, SEGA’s Master System, and, a decade later, the original Xbox.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bury Me in Black</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninja-gaiden-black-1760964153805.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Team Ninja's 2004 3D re-imagining of Ninja Gaiden was an action game revolution.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth generation of video games featured some of the most influential games of all time. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Resident Evil 4. Halo: Combat Evolved. Kingdom Hearts. Metal Gear Solid 3. The list goes on and on. So, it would take a forward-thinking (not to mention generation-defining) entry in the Ninja Gaiden series to cut its own place in what many consider one of gaming’s best generations. For Ninja Gaiden, no fewer than three games kept the series sharp during a time where the competition was fierce and groundbreaking innovation was everywhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years earlier, Tecmo had established a new internal studio to develop Dead or Alive. But by the turn of the millenium, that studio – now named Team Ninja – had begun work on a new Ninja Gaiden. That project would become 2004’s Ninja Gaiden, released exclusively on Microsoft’s new Xbox console. Its expanded 2005 release, Ninja Gaiden Black, is considered one of the greatest action games of not only the sixth generation, but of all time. IGN gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/19/ninja-gaiden-black">incredibly high score of 9.4</a>, praising its fast-paced combat, its hard but rewarding gameplay, and action. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original, this new take on the series had the goal of redefining the standards of what an action game could be. While the cutscenes looked great for the time, it’s Ninja Gaiden’s gameplay that would once again shine and raise the bar for challenging action games across the board, while still emphasizing the strike hard, strike fast precision and timing from the NES era games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is more chaotic and aggressive now that Ryu can be attacked in three dimensions, and parrying incoming attacks relies heavily on timing and rhythm. You can't just button mash your way through enemies – it requires a more methodical approach with each encounter, something you hone through a lot of death. Just like in the first game, you're taught this right off the bat as you find yourself fighting two very annoying ninjas on a cliffside. Rhythm, timing, and enemy behavior are important here. Foes can attack you from all sides and quickly overwhelm Ryu. Choosing when to attack, when to dodge, and when to avoid enemies ends up becoming a meta game of rock, paper, scissors, and it’s something we’ve seen in countless games since – from the Batman Arkham series to practically every Souls game ever. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ng2b-1760964258281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja Gaiden 2 was re-released in 2025 with remastered visuals and extra content.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For some players, myself included, Ninja Gaiden Black was one of the first games where, even though the gameplay could get extremely frustrating at times, it was pretty hard to put down once the game's core mechanics were figured out. For me, it wasn't until I beat the first boss, timing my strikes and dodges by finding the right balance between patience and aggression, that I understood how rewarding Ninja Gaiden could be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time the final boss comes stomping around, I’d been trained to fight in such a way that the entire event feels cinematic based on its gameplay, not cutscenes. Instead of cheesing the boss and spamming the attack button a million times until their health bar hits zero (which is how I unsuccessfully played at the start of the game,) I found myself dodging and parrying in ways I simply couldn't early on in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a journey that's found in pretty much every high-difficulty, high-reward game to this day. But if you take a step back and think about it, by forcing the player to “get good”, or at least achieve some semblance of a flow state, the combat actually becomes a narrative device that helps progress the story. By combining parries, dodges, and attacks with razor precision, you grow alongside Ryu. You get stronger alongside Ryu. And, most importantly, by the end, you fight like a master Ninja. It’s just like what the first game achieved, way back in 1988. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Never Fade Away</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not as impactful as the 2004 release, Ninja Gaiden 2 and 3 went on to receive critical acclaim and multiple re-releases and revisions. These games improved on what made the original Xbox release so meaningful, pushing Gaiden’s precise combat and difficulty into the next console generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the franchise didn't cut through the competition in quite the same way Ninja Gaiden Black did at the height of the sixth console generation. And so it wasn't until well over a decade later that indie developer The Game Kitchen would revitalize the series with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. What’s old is new again. Ragebound took the series back to its 2D roots, adding more to the lore of Ninja Gaiden, and perfecting the series’s difficult-but-fair gameplay for a new generation of side-scrollers. It went on to be considered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">one of the best</a> entries in the series, according to the IGN audience, and I concur. What’s more, it helped pave the way for the latest instalment, Ninja Gaiden 4, which looks set to raise the bar again for a new generation of hyper-violent and tough action games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impossible to overstate the impact Ninja Gaiden has had on action games over the years. Its DNA can be found in hundreds of great games – echoes of its excellent combat mechanics, crushing difficulty, and use of cinematics can be found everywhere in the genre. Simply put, action games as they are today simply wouldn’t exist without the influence of Ninja Gaiden.</p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ninja-gaidens-razer-sharp-gameplay-still-influences-games-today]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO of Take-Two, has once again shared his thoughts on AI in the video game space, and he believes the technology is "great" but people are overstating what it can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/ai-is-a-combination-of-metadata-with-a-parlor-trick-take-two-boss-says-a-great-thing-for-business-but-its-not-creative-and-never-will-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a> that Zelnick said at the Paley International Council Summit this week that, "AI is a great thing" for "every industry," including video games. But it's not a magic wand.</p><p>"Will it recreate or create genius? No. Will it create hits? No. It's a bunch of data with a bunch of compute with a language model attached," he said.</p><p>The executive added that AI will probably be able to help people work more efficiently, but AI is not a forward-looking technology that can actually do anything creative.</p><p>"What AI is, is the combination of big datasets with a bunch of compute within natural LLM—a large language model," Zelnick said. "And by definition, a data set is what? Backward-looking. By definition, creativity is what? Forward-looking. And to the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what? A predictive model."</p><p>What's more, Zelnick pushed back on the claim that AI will lead to net losses in jobs, citing historical evidence to make his point. "In 1865, 65% of the US workforce was involved in agriculture. Today we make food for America and food for the rest of the world. And 2% of the workforce is involved with agriculture. And I defy you to find anyone who recently said to you, 'It's so horrible, I can't get a job as a farmer,'" he said.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said the term "artificial intelligence" is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">oxymoron</a> because machines cannot learn. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>Zelnick also previously talked about how people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.7, which brings a "highly anticipated" playable character, a brand new permanent game mode, and more early next month.</p>

<p>As announced in a press release, Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", launches on November 5th across all platforms. As you'd probably expect, the update's story follows on from that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-3-6-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 3.6</a>&nbsp;and "marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga".</p>

<p>You'll explore the Ruins of Time, where a huge sword marks the place in which Phainon used his power to seal away the dread Irontomb. Naturally, Irontomb is stirring once more, and it'll be up to you and your team to put him down again.</p>

Just by having her in your team, your party's damage will be increased.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Cyrene can deploy a Zone on the battlefield that deals an additional instance of damage to any enemy within it that's struck by an ally. Her Ultimate uses stacks of the Remembrance resource to activate her teammates' Ultimate abilities and to buff teammates further.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new gameplay mode in the form of Currency Wars, which sees players forming teams of up to ten fighters in order to take part in combat operations. 61 characters will be available as part of this mode, and you'll be able to try them all out as part of a free trial as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", will launch on November 5th across all of these platforms. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-nearly-at-6m-for-opening-week.1333954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced first-week sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and the game is outpacing past titles like&nbsp;<em>X&amp;Y&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Let's Go: Pikachu</em>, although it can't quite hold a candle to the series' heaviest hitters.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official report</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1981553421472706640" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wario64</a>),&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>has sold 5.8 million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">launching on October 16th</a>, and almost half of those sales were on Switch 2, so that's a pretty even split platform-wise.</p>

<p>As noted by sales analyst <a href="https://x.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pierre485</a>, this figure makes&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>the fifth fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game in the series. It's lagging behind titles like <i>Scarlet and Violet</i>,&nbsp;<em>Sword and Shield</em>, and its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Legends: Arceus</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-mega-gardevoir.jpg?itok=gHvRBstT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-mega-gardevoir.jpg?itok=xbURqT-Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit six million.</figcaption></figure><p>It's noteworthy that the five fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games are now all on Switch hardware. No doubt Nintendo will take this as an encouraging sign when it comes to the upcoming tenth generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, details of which were apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" rel="nofollow">leaked earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in what is now the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, which shifts its gameplay away from the traditional series emphasis on catching 'em all in favor of a more narrative and research-led approach.</p>

<p>This time around, you're exploring the city of Lumiose in order to assist the Quasartico corporation with an urban redevelopment project, all while attempting to raise your trainer rank to the coveted A in the titular Z-A Royale event.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of game lies in store for you should you decide to check it out, right here.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the original <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-121292/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/805679/dispatch-review-steam-ps5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-offers-a-rare-unique-twist-on-superhero-stories.1333951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We are saturated with superhero media to the point where even self-criticism has been done to death with franchises like <em>Watchmen</em> and <em>The Boys</em>. But with its debut choice-driven narrative adventure, AdHoc Studio has managed to find a unique angle for the superhero genre.</p><p>In <em>Dispatch</em>, the story focuses on an office-based lackey and corporate manager of said superheroes, rather than the heroes themselves. This is a beautifully animated, episodic choice-driven narrative adventure, very much drawing from the team’s history at Telltale Games. So far, only two of eight episodes have been released, with two more launching every week through November 12th. However, be prepared for very little interaction in this interactive experience.</p><p>As the unfortunately named Robert Robertson III (played brilliantly by Aaron Paul), a down-on-his-luck hero without powers, you are a dispatcher for a superhero security company. Instead of cops or security guards, clients call the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN) to assist in all manner of issues, from cats in trees to jewelry heists. Robert manages his own team of reformed supervillains, and it’s up to you to decide which of the misfits to send, based on their personal history and powers. Do you send the crypto-bro manbat to escort a celebrity, or the charismatic popstar with magic light powers? Do you send the stealthy ex-assassin or the girl who can turn invisible to infiltrate a robbery?</p><p>These are the quick choices you make when Robert sits for his first day on the job, after about an hourlong intro. Robert’s choices affect the outcome of the particular emergency, which, if successful, leads to heroes leveling up various attributes. These attributes — like combat and charisma — determine the outcome of a scenario. For example, you wouldn’t send the inarticulate fire superhero to an event that requires a good speaker. The scenarios pop up on his ’90s-era computer screen, much like short emergencies in a <em>SimCity</em> game. You never actually see any animation taking place during these scenarios, given Robert is deskbound and communicating solely via voice. However, having access to just the first two episodes has meant I’ve only dispatched twice, taking up about five to 10 minutes each time.</p><p>Outside of dispatch missions, most of the game involves dialogue and action choices, and quick-time events (though these can be turned off). Anyone who played Telltale’s iconic <em>The Walking Dead</em> will know the mechanics. However, this is one of the most restrictive narrative adventures I’ve played. You don’t even get to control Robert’s movements in terms of walking and talking. This is less a <em>Monkey Island</em> adventure and more <em>Black Mirror</em>’s <em>Bandersnatch</em>. This does seem to allow for consistently stunning and handcrafted animation, however, of a quality to match high-quality adult animated shows like <em>Invincible</em> and <em>Arcane</em>. Add to this a stellar cast — including the aforementioned Paul, there’s Laura Bailey, Jeffrey Wright, Travis Willingham, and others — and it really does feel like a high-budget show.</p><p>The downside is the limited consequences — at least early on. I played the two episodes a few times, given how brief each one is (the first episode took about 30 minutes), and made different choices to see just how different the outcomes would be. Barring a decision in a bar fight that either did or did not lead to a recurring character’s front tooth getting knocked out, very little of the game’s story changed. To be fair, I have no idea how late into the complete season the consequences will manifest. Several times a pop-up of “X will remember that” appeared, but only a few times did I see the outcome of that.</p><p>Related to these limitations are “combat” sequences — despite being quick-time events, the one I experienced had no differing outcome if you just left the buttons alone. You can turn quick-time events off, but even with them on, the outcome doesn’t change. I don’t know what point these quick-time events serve, whether on or off, which speaks to how on-rails and restrictive the game is.</p><p>The story begins with Robert, known as MechaMan, who pilots a giant suit of robot armor, tracking down his dad’s killer. His father, who was MechaMan before him, was murdered by a supervillain named Shroud. In an ensuing fight, the suit is destroyed and Robert is left with nothing. He is soon recruited by an actual superpowered superhero, Blonde Blazer, the most generic “hot blonde” hero you could imagine.</p><p>By contrast, the main character Robert is not at all generic: neither a grump nor entitled windbag. He’s determined, articulate, and thoughtful. He’s given the worst team to manage but takes it as a challenge rather than a slight. While you get to make choices, Robert’s character is very much set.</p><p>The game’s strength lies in its writing and characters. Without the restrictions of working with licensed characters, the developers are wonderfully creative with their heroes. I thoroughly enjoyed the brief interactions between and with the weirdos in spandex you are given. As a non-powered hero, Robert navigates them with both tension and annoyance but not fear. I am looking forward to seeing how relationships develop and with whom Robert bonds.</p><p>But for now I’m only cautiously optimistic about where <em>Dispatch</em> is going. Through the first two episodes — which barely take up two hours, and feature on-rails outcomes, limited interaction, and little idea of the actual plot — I am uncertain. I fell in love with the animation, the voice work, and the characters, but those are elements you can experience as a let’s play on YouTube. Now the game needs to show me why I should play rather than watch.</p><p><sub><em>The first two episodes of</em> Dispatch <em>are available now on the PS5 and Steam.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/805679/dispatch-review-steam-ps5]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Upgrading to a new business laptop shouldn’t mean breaking the bank, but it also doesn’t mean settling for something basic just to save money. Ideally, your work laptop should be powerful enough to handle your busiest days, plus support some weekend fun like gaming or streaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>HP offers some of the best options on the market for this, though the performance usually comes with a higher price tag. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Thankfully, that changes today. Amazon is currently offering a mind-boggling 75% discount on the 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, bringing the price down to just $750.</a> Honestly, that’s what you’d pay for most entry-level machines on a normal day, and the offer doesn’t end here. You’re also getting a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase. The only catch? The discount ends soon, meaning you don’t have a lot of time left to grab it. Snag it for less while the offer is still available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Powerful Processor for Impressive Multitasking</h2>
<p>Starting with the performance, you’re getting an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor that’s made to support heavier applications and creative tasks without lags. Along with that, there’s 32GB of RAM to take care of multitasking. Whether your day requires you to hop between multiple programs at once, use a ton of different tabs simultaneously, or test your sanity with longer, never-ending spreadsheets, it’s all going to be possible. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a 1TB SSD that’s spacious enough to house all your essentials, plus also ensures faster boot times.</p>



<p>The large 17.3-inch display is much bigger than most other options in this range, and gives you plenty of screen real estate for work and play. Visuals stay lifelike in all lighting conditions, thanks to its anti-glare coating. You’ve also got a full-sized keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use – you won’t be left with a sore wrist at the end of a long work day.</p>
<p>This machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. The operating system is one of the most user-friendly ones out there, and Copilot integration takes the experience even further. You’re going to have an AI assistant ready to help you 24/7. Need help with a math problem? Ask away. Figuring out how long to bake that cake? It’s got you covered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Other freebies include a wireless mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, and a 7-in-1 cleaning kit.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-patch-notes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-patch-notes-includes-changes-to-progression-visibility-and-weapons.1333945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s upcoming Season 1 will come with a series of different challenges that will change the game for the better. In a post by Battlefield Communications, the patch notes reveal that changes will be coming to some of the game’s absurd challenges, improvements to player visibility, and changes to weapon dispersion.</p>



<p>You can see the full patch notes below; some of which are already live.</p>



<p><em>Live Now:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Search: </strong>We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Spawn Bug:</strong> We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.</li>



<li><strong>Portal Server Availability:</strong> Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a> on how to get Full XP in Verified modes.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Upcoming Changes:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Player Movement</strong>: We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience. In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</li>



<li><strong>Progression: </strong>We are continuing to monitor the impact of the changes that were made <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979183830113087566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a> and already seeing a smoother experience as we roll into Season 1. Some additional areas we are tracking:</li>



<li>XP earned in Escalation and King of the Hill is not always working as intended. We are planning to significantly increase the payout to bring them in line with other modes and will keep monitoring once the changes are live.</li>



<li>We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates. Some examples of what we are currently considering are:</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – 30 to 3</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles in a Match – From 6000 to 1000</li>



<li>Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – from 150 to 5</li>



<li>In addition, a later game update will reduce the 200m distance</li>



<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> We are actively looking into adjustments to exposure and brightness. This will lead to improvements in places where players have experienced blinding light when looking outdoors, overly dark interiors when looking indoors, and a lack of visibility around weapon optics when zooming in. These adjustments are part of a wider pass focused on improving visibility that we expect to complete later in Season 1.</li>



<li><strong>Weapon Dispersion: </strong>As part of our Season 1 Update 1 (October 28), we’re making several adjustments to how weapon dispersion behaves. These changes are aimed at ensuring each weapon’s accuracy better reflects its intended performance over range. We’ve also fixed a bug that caused dispersion to not decrease as expected when transitioning from sprinting to a prone position.</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ll continue refining how weapon accuracy behaves in battle to make your shots feel more consistent and rewarding across all weapon types. Our upcoming tuning pass will reduce the overall impact of dispersion across multiple weapon types while keeping the core intent intact. Burst-firing will remain the most effective way to control a weapon, and each weapon will still perform best within its intended range. We’ve also identified a couple of bugs that caused weapons to feel less accurate than intended:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Post-Sprint Firing:</strong> Weapons fired immediately after sprinting while zoomed could retain higher dispersion, reducing accuracy.</li>



<li><strong>Movement Start:</strong> Dispersion was increasing faster than it should when players began moving, making even small adjustments unexpectedly impact precision. This was especially noticeable on controllers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-regarding-battlefield-labs"><strong>Regarding Battlefield Labs</strong></h2>



<p>We are taking a brief hiatus on Battlefield Labs as we prioritize the rollout of Season 1 content. Labs is at its best when we can iterate quickly with you, and it was invaluable in how much it helped us prepare for the launch of Battlefield 6. More updates will be shared when play sessions are returning and we will continue to develop the future of Battlefield 6 together.</p>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-mode-learnings-and-updates"><strong>Battle Royale Mode: Learnings and Updates</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of Battlefield Labs, we have updates on the</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Battle Royale mode</a></p>



<p>following the suggestions we received during our play sessions. Your Battlefield Labs feedback has helped us fine-tune key elements for this experience. Here’s a quick look at what changes you may notice the next time you play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Close-range TTK</strong>: We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li>



<li><strong>Armor Changes</strong>: Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li>



<li><strong>World Improvements</strong>: We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Balance</strong>: We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li>
</ul>



<p>We have also been working on providing smoother performance overall. We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn’t have done without our players’ involvement in the tests.</p>

                <p>The rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">a Simpsons-themed season of Fortnite</a> began earlier this year, but it's been picking up steam in the last few weeks. Now, some apparent leaks have revealed which Simpsons characters will be in the battle pass, and what fans can expect from the map of Springfield.</p><p>According to this leak, the battle pass includes Homer Simpson and his wife, Marge Simpson. Ned Flanders appears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-collab-could-feature-a-flanders-skin/1100-6535598/" data-ref-id="1100-6535598">confirm a previous rumor</a>, but there's no sign of Bart, Lisa, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-will-add-moe-from-the-simpsons-in-next-major-update-it-seems/1100-6535664/" data-ref-id="1100-6535664">Moe</a>.

A <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20306" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kang and Kodos UFO glider</a> has been found, but it was also left out of the battle pass.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">map of Springfield</a> has also unofficially dropped, and it appears to be a collection of landmarks from the Simpsons' hometown themed over a traditional Fortnite island rather than a complete map of the city.</p><p>A few of the recognizable locations on the map include Evergreen Terrace, Springfield's town square, the nuclear power plant, Mr. Burns' manor, Krusty Burger, and the Duff Brewery. Another leak suggests that Fortnite will begin the build up to the new season later today by placing Bart's treehouse in the game.</p><p>A short Fortnite season will launch on November 1, but Epic Games has yet to confirm it will be The Simpsons-themed season. The Simpsons TV series is closing in on its 40th anniversary in 2029, but the characters have been largely absent from consoles for almost two decades.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> has launched into early access on PC, available to those who pre-order the game on that platform. For those on consoles or mobile, the game will become available to play a little later on the 4th November.</p>
<p>The beta was pushed back a few hours by developer Sports Interactive, <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1981394069147292039">so some final checks on the early access build</a> could be made, but as of writing those who drop £44.99 / 53,99€ / $53.99 can now play the game. It's available on Steam, the Epic Game Store, and the Windows Store. It'll be coming to PC Game Pass soon, alongside the Xbox release in November.</p>
<p>In this early release version of the game, you can hop into a single player career mode or an online career, all progress in both will of course carry over in the full release come November. The game has a revamped interface compared to previous entries in the series, as well as fresh UI, possession formations (not the supernatural kind), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-26-adds-the-womens-game-for-the-first-time-with-official-barclays-womens-super-league-inclusion">and women's teams</a>!</p>

<p>The game also has a revamped manager creator, which allows players to really put those fine touches on the poor soul who'll be blamed for every lost game and subpar benching decision. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-26-will-finally-include-official-fifa-licensing-for-the-first-time-with-a-special-international-management-update-for-the-world-cup">Football Manager announced earlier this month that the series had partnered with Fifa in a multi-year deal</a>, which provides an official licence for big FIFA competitions to the game. This includes the FIFA World Cup 2026, in Canada, Mexico, and the USA.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourselves-football-manager-fans-ive-played-a-day-of-fm26-and-its-going-to-take-a-lot-of-getting-used-to">We've played Football Manager 26, and it'll take some getting used to</a> for series fans. However, if you're sick of hearing about the game and want to see all these changes yourselves, the game currently has a 10% discount during the early access period. Why not buy it, and check it out?</p>

			<p>The October 23 Borderlands 4 patch introduces undocumented performance improvements on PC, according to a new comparison video shared on YouTube.</p>



<p>The video shared by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC </a>highlights how the latest update for the new entry in the series by Gearbox Software introduces a roughly 10% performance improvement at both 4K and 1440p resolutions. While barely hitting 59 FPS at 4K resolution on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080 is still a strong indication that more work is needed to improve Borderlands 4, these improvements are a step in the right direction.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these undocumented performance improvements on PC, the Borderlands 4 October 23 patch introduces widespread stability improvements, multiplayer fixes, UI polish and quality-of-life updates to celebrate the game's first month of availability on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>The patch also brings significant balance changes to further refine late-game, mission flow, and the overall player experience. The full details of everything the new patch brings can be found on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/525357766327403014?l=english">official Borderlands 4 October 23 patch notes.</a></p>



<p>While work continues on the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S versions of the game, the development of the Borderlands 4 Nintendo Switch 2 port is also continuing. Originally scheduled for an October 2025 release, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">the port was delayed indefinitely last month</a>, and all pre-orders have been refunded. Given the game's current performance woes on all platforms, the Switch 2 version was likely delayed due to performance concerns.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-development-moderation-phil-spencer-2000638826</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-reveals-his-thoughts-on-xbox-using-ai.1333921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AI arms race is currently eating up hundreds of billions of dollars in investment as companies compete over a technology whose exact benefits are still far from clear. Microsoft is at the center of that fight. How is the head of Microsoft gaming thinking about <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">fitting AI into development</a>? “Our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space,” Phil Spencer said during a recent panel discussion.</p> <p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space">by <em>IGN</em></a>, he was speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California on the topic of “Big Ideas, Small Games: Creativity Beyond the Blockbuster” with Double Fine studio head Tim Schafer <a href="https://kotaku.com/keeper-the-kotaku-review-xbox-game-pass-how-long-is-it-good-price-2000637702">following the release of <em>Keeper</em></a>. Microsoft has been pushing AI into all of its products and CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">bragged about</a> relying on multiple AI assistants throughout the day to run one of the biggest tech firms in the world.</p>

 <p>But it’s less clear how those tools are being used by rank-and-file employees within the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">especially on the gaming side</a>.&nbsp;According to Spencer, Microsoft gaming’s biggest deployment of AI technology right now is in its platform moderation tools. The company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/13/xbox-transparency-report-new-ai-solutions/">announced last year</a> that it’s been using AI tools to help flag and intercept offensive or spam-related communications on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls,” he said during yesterday’s panel. “That’s our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn’t the most glamorous use of AI, but it’s something that I fundamentally believe in.”</p>

 <p>When it comes to other applications on the player-facing front, Spencer suggested AI could also help with one of the biggest challenges in gaming right now: game discovery and curation. “It’s not in practice today, but is there a way for us to use discovery based on things that you’ve done in the past to surface the next thing that you might not know about that might be interesting to you?” he speculated.</p>

 <p>When it comes to game development, however, Spencer seemed to downplay any significant use of AI tools when it comes to things like creating concept art, programming code, or scripting dialogue.&nbsp;“On the creative side, I really leave it up to the teams,” the executive said. “I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate.”</p> <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>On the production side, which I think is where a lot of people go…we don’t have any goals in our model for that to happen. I think more about the pace of creativity, maybe the number of things we can try and take risks on before we decide on our next opportunity. But our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s a far cry from the promises that some gaming company executives are making about how AI can help them drastically cut costs and ship games more quickly and efficiently. Last year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was at “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">the very core</a>” of the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> publisher’s business. That company is <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">now reportedly banking on an AI</a> revolution to help it service a new $20 billion loan as part of a private equity buyout led by Saudi Arabia.</p>

I love that universe. I’m ready. Anytime”. Krogan? Salarian? Turian? The possibilities are endless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, developer BioWare has yet to pick up the phone and call on Hale to return for Mass Effect 5, but that doesn’t mean we should give up hope. Hale pleaded with fans to let BioWare know that you’d love to see Shepard return somehow — the developers could find a way to make the hundreds of years gap work, I’m sure. Or, perhaps more likely, pop Commander Shepard in the game as a holographic display in some future museum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone out there, the more you tell them what you want, maybe the likelier it is that it'll happen,” Hale said. And who are we to disregard the orders of our Commander?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, all of this was said amid a turbulent time for both BioWare and its parent company, EA. Earlier this year, it was reported that the studio <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams"><u>had been entirely restructured, following the disappointment of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, to focus entirely on Mass Effect</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, EA was acquired and made private by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo"><u>an investor group composed of the Saudi Arabian PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an eye-watering $55 billion deal.</u></a> It’s currently unclear how this change in ownership has affected projects in development, such as the new Mass Effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details may be very thin as to what we can expect next from BioWare’s landmark sci-fi RPG series, but fear not, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-wait-for-mass-effect-5-director-seemingly-confirms-returning-feature"><u>one returning feature has been confirmed by the game’s director</u></a>, Michael Gamble: excessive lens flare.

BioWare has suggested that the game will be set hundreds of years after the original Mass Effect trilogy, with a story that spans the events of both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy featured in the series' fourth main game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Would you like to see Jennifer Hale and Commander Shepard return in the next chapter of Mass Effect alongside that lens flare?

    <p><span>Cyrene joins the fray in the Amphoreous saga's grand finale.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “As Tomorrow Became Yesterday,” will launch on November 5, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1002255"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga. As Trailblazers brace for their final challenge, Cyrene joins the ranks as a new playable character. Alongside her debut, powerful enemies and exciting limited-time events await, inviting players to embark on the adventure across a world brimming with danger and rewards.</p><p>Over the course of the Amphoreous saga, the Astral Express trio inherited the Titan Coreflames, gaining newfound strength and becoming inextricably bound to Amphoreous’s destiny. Now, the Astral Express crew stands shoulder to shoulder with the Chrysos Heirs, confronting “Irontomb”—the most formidable foe to time itself, in a battle whose weight surpasses anything Amphoreous has ever faced. Yet the conflict extends beyond the paths of Destruction and Erudition, as the forces of Remembrance stir in the dark. With the cosmos on the brink, no great power can afford to remain silent. Through the resolve of the Trailblazers and the wisdom of the geniuses, a Cosmic Alliance begins to rise. </p><p>The final battlefield lies within the “Ruins of Time”, a barren realm where gravel drifts through the air and the horizon fades into an endless wilderness. When Irontomb’s power once stirred prematurely, Phainon poured all his strength into sealing it away—the Trailblazer can see a giant sword piercing into the earth’s core, and a statue that resembles Phainon. He left behind three layers of seals, waiting for the day his companions would return to break them, and together, bring Irontomb to its end.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002323"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As the final battle unfolds, Cyrene joins the roster of playable characters. From the very beginning of the Amphoreous journey, she has accompanied the Trailblazers in many different forms. In Version 3.7, Cyrene will finally open up to the Trailblazer she trusts the most, revealing her long-hidden past and the answers behind her mysteries. Cyrene is a 5-star Ice-Type character on the Path of the Remembrance. When she is on the team, the DMG dealt by all allies is increased. Cyrene’s Skill deploys a Zone. While it is active, any damage dealt by an ally to an enemy will trigger an additional instance of True DMG. Meanwhile, every action a teammate takes stacks “Recollection” for Cyrene. When “Recollection” is fully stacked, Cyrene can activate her Ultimate, reaching her most powerful state. When Cyrene uses her Ultimate for the first time, it will instantly activate the Ultimates of all teammates and make her Zone permanent. At this point, she also summons Cyrene in her memosprite form. This “memosprite Cyrene” can choose to enhance any teammate, and if the target is a Chrysos Heir character, they will be granted an exclusive special effect. Furthermore, when memosprite Cyrene takes action, it can either buff teammates or deal damage to all enemies, helping lead the team to victory.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the new version, a large-scale permanent gameplay mode, “Currency Wars,” will make its debut. Trailblazers can form teams of up to ten characters, divided into “on-field” and “off-field” areas that work together in combat. When characters of the same combat type or belonging to the same faction fight side by side, they will trigger special “Bond” effects, unleashing greater power as a team. At launch, “Currency Wars” will feature 61 participating characters, all of whom will be available for free trial. As a major permanent mode, in addition to challenge rewards, it also features a periodic reward system similar to “Divergent Universe,” and will introduce new challenges and growth experiences through updates.</p><p>There’s still plenty for Trailblazers to look forward to in this update. The new event, “Snack Dash,” is on its way, inviting Trailblazers to take part in a lighthearted competition full of creativity and fun. Madam Ruan Mei’s delightful creations will race across obstacle-filled tracks, striving for the finish line and higher rankings. Version 3.7 will also implement the “Trailblaze Fashion” system, giving players more fun cosmetic customization options, including the limited headwear “Deliverer’s Wreath” available for free after completing the version’s Main Missions. Finally, a new animated short, “Hello, World,” and the song  “Ripples of Past Reverie, ” among other new content, will be released to accompany players as they reflect on the journey across the past seven versions and witness the perfect conclusion to the Amphoreus saga.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,692 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,637 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

                <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard has teased that "even more" Fallout is coming, with many taking that to be a suggestion about more games in the series.

			<p>At the end of the Ninja Gaiden 4 campaign, Yakumo acquires a fifth weapon, the Dark Dragon Blade, which allows him to fight the game's final boss on equal ground. Here's how to permanently unlock this powerful final weapon in less than 30 minutes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Method tested in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version after the completion of two different playtroughs, which the author played at Normal and Hard difficulty. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>

<p>The <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> is the final weapon for Yakumo. It is permanently unlocked by completing the following steps:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defeat the Dark Dragon</strong> in Chapter 19 to complete the main campaign. Any difficulty will do. This will unlock additional post-game content, including the <strong>Boss Trial</strong> challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Complete all of the Boss Trial challenges</strong> to permanently unlock the <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> and use it in Story Mode and Challenge Mode, including Chapter Challenge, Purgatorium re-runs, and Combat Trials.</li>
</ol>

<figure><figcaption><em>Use the Senjin War Brew item to increase your attack power and cut down the time needed to defeat the enemy in the Boss Trial challenges</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fighting and defeating all 13 of the main campaign bosses can take significant time and effort, especially powerful bosses like Ryu Hayabusa. However, there is a way to speed up the process considerably taking advantage of some of the game's difficulty mechanics.</p>



<p>This method uses the <strong>Hero Difficulty</strong> setting, which increases your damage output and dramatically lowers boss health, making the challenge trivial:</p>



<ol>

            <p>You are leaving the mission area, soldier! Actually, the mission area is leaving you. It is sick of your shit. It has decided that your foxhole isn’t part of acceptable reality anymore. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s long-awaited battle royale mode seems likely to be revealed on 28th October. In less than a week, we could be laying eyes on the Battlefield interpretation of the well-worn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">Plunkbat</a> and/or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> premise of a vast map fringed by corrosive oblivion that shrinks over time, forcing scavenging players into a claustrophobic last stand.
</p><!--more-->
<p>A datamine of EA’s own app has disclosed (on <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">Xitter</a>, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/battlefield-6-may-be-getting-its-battle-royale-mode-next-week/">VGC</a>) a piece of content for next week’s Battlefield 6 Season 1 rollout called “Granite”. Which isn’t that revealing, but Battlefield 6’s developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">hitherto said</a> that they plan to begin the game’s seasonal update career with a touch of Fortniting, so the timing adds up. 
</p>
<p>“There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale,” they observed earlier this month. Friend, had you told me you were “ideating on new ideas” in-game I’d have gunned you down like a dog, possibly using the M357 Trait sidearm due to be added on November 18th. 
</p>
<p>We already know that Season 1 will bring maps, modes, timed events, vehicles, attachments, guns and melee weapons. The biggest thing missing from the current roadmap is that promised battle royale functionality. Again, the Granite shoe fits. I am interested to see what they call the mode - Battlefield Royale, Player Unknown’s Battlefield 6 and Battlefortnite are all there for the taking.
</p><p>I guess it’s possible that they’re literally adding some granite to Battlefield 6. I’d actually love to play a Battlefield game that blurs the lines with Minecraft in updating the levels with different materials. Possibly this is something you can already do in Battlefield’s Portal editor, when you’re not using it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">jumpstart the progression</a>.</p>

            <p>Right, so, I've thus far failed to grow a second pair of hands, despite Edwin suggesting me and Oisin try. Sorry, mate. As a result, here's a quick run around the houses of interesting stuff we've not covered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">yesterday's Galaxies showcase</a> that I think's worth nattering about.</p>
<p>Look, you can't ask a person to choose between writing about a shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> expansion and some other things that folks in the RPSverse may also be interested in hearing about. I can't be expected to make decisions. That's illegal.</p>

<p>Without further waffle, that DLC for apocalypse wagon scavenger Pacific Drive is called Whisper in the Woods. It's out now and boasts and 8 to 12 hour-long story you can jump into after trundling through the first few hours of the base game. "Witness the rise of a group of Anomaly-obsessed fanatics" its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam blurb</a> declares, adding you'll run across weird artefacts which can make your journeys more dangerous as you explore the expansion's murmuring thicket.</p>
<p>I dug the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pacific-drive-review">base game</a>'s blending of driving game car tinkering with post-apocalyptic survival intrigue, though it hasn't tempted me back to fire up the bodged motor again since that point. Into the backlog list it goes.</p>

<p>Next up, a fresh trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> 2, the shooty and sawy sequel to (you'll never guess) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>. It's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">coming in 2026</a>. "PURGE THE HERETICS" it screams as a train arrives to mess shit up, amid action Doom-loving dads (and other folks) would likely dig. There's also a moment early on when the protagoist is dropped out of a rubbish chute, the world's angriest partially-eaten sandwich.</p>
<p>Moving on, and train skateboard thing Denshattack got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBMJQDpo__w">release window</a>. It's out in Spring 2026. James has already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">waxed plenty of lyrical</a> about it.</p>
<p>Finally, Solasta II's set to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecp8AtdDdSg">head into early access</a> early next year. Wait, is that the same RPG sequel to Solasta: Crown Of The Magister that was apparently supposed to launch into early access next year as of December last year, according to this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-is-getting-a-sequel-starring-baldurs-gate-3s-narrator">bit from Nic</a>? No idea, but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2975950/view/632317708781750334?l=english">Steam post</a> that says it's definitely off into early access in 2026, so I'm certain it'll get there at some point. There's also a demo out now.</p>
<p>Finally Finally, I just want to quickly mention Shroom &amp; Gloom, a fungal roguelike double-deckbuilder which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEol2-8R6s">looks pretty cool</a> and also has a demo out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271280/Shroom_and_Gloom/">Steam</a>. Annnnnnndddddd, exhale.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-elite-series-2-core-controller-is-selling-fast-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-an-all-time-low-2000638568</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-elite-series-2-core-controller-is-selling-fast-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-an-all-time-low.1333879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller has a heftier feel, made from heavier materials to give you some real weight to hold onto in your hand when compared to the standard Xbox wireless controller. It’s also got a rubberized grip and short hair triggers. The thumbstick mobility can be adjusted to your exact preferences, plus you get a lot of swappable parts to truly cater to your playstyle. T<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/">hat normally retails for $180 (even though Amazon says its usually $200), but right now, the site has it one sale for just $153.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customize Your Way of Play</h2>
<p>While you can get the white Elite Series 2 controller for the cheaper price of just $130, that only comes with the core controller plus a tool for thumbstick adjustment and a USB-C cable. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller in black comes with the whole kit and caboodle. Along with the thumbstick tool and charging cable, you get a charging dock to place your controller in when you’re done playing. This will ensure you always are starting any gaming session at 100%.</p>
<p>You also receive a set of four back paddles which can be assigned to any button function. By default, they will be assigned to the face buttons of A, B, X, and Y. This any first person shooter play so much better. No more do you have to take your thumb off the right stick to jump or to reload or to slide or switch weapons. Just tap one of the paddles without giving up your aim.</p>



<p>On top of that, it comes with three pairs of additional thumbsticks in different styles. The default ones are similar to what you find on Xbox’s standard controller, with the concave center and grips along the edges. The first additional pair of sticks is just a backup of the standard pair. Then you also get a dome designed set of sticks as well as the standard style but taller. It felt weird at first, but I like using the short standard on the left stick but then the tall one on the right which allows for more precise movements while aiming.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is looking to capture the extraction shooter market. Doing so brings up a myriad of questions concerning wipe progression, if any beta progress carries over into the full game, and how it differs from its rivals.</p>



<p>Let’s not beat around the bush: Escape From Tarkov is regarded as the first extraction shooter, and it introduced a whole new hybrid of shooter, looting, and exploring. One of the reasons it’s both adored and frustrating for players is progression and wipes. Tarkov regularly has a ‘wipe’ where the entire player base effectively starts over from scratch—restarting your progress and giving you a new reason to play again.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is also an extraction shooter using a lot of the same fundamentals. Let’s see how similar its wipe system is, and if it even has one.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-progression-wipe">Does ARC Raiders Have A Progression Wipe?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Best of both worlds. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders has an optional progression wipe called “Expedition Projects” that works in a similar style to wipes, but is much deeper, and not every player has to do it.</strong></p>



<p>It’s good news for those of you who don’t like progression wipes. Since day one, the developer has stressed that the <strong>game will not have mandatory wipes</strong>, and the game uses something they’ve touted as a “Voluntary reset mechanic.”</p>



<p>It’s understandable if you don’t want to have hours and days of gameplay essentially be for nothing once the wipe hits. This is why Embark Studios has worked hard to create its own system for ARC Raiders—<a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Expedition Projects</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the full game, players will have access to a feature called “Projects”. At level 20, the first major project players will have access to is the Expedition Project. Upon completion, this project makes a character reset available. If a player completes a reset, they will be able to do so again so long as they complete another of these projects.</p>



<p>The Expedition Project will operate on a repeating cycle of roughly 8 weeks. During the course of these 8 weeks, players can contribute toward and make progress on their Expedition Project, which will overall be a somewhat large time investment. At the start of the 8th week, the ability to finalize the project will become available &amp; will remain available for that entire week. If a player has fulfilled all of the necessary stages of the project, they will be able to commit to completing the Expedition during this period.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s also explained that you can continue making progress toward the project, even after the period of time has passed.</p>



<p>Performing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">optional progression wipe</a> grants you exclusive rewards and unlocks that will stay with your account forever. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-beta-progression-carry-to-full-game">Does ARC Raiders Beta Progression Carry To Full Game?</h2>



<p><strong>None of the progress you have made in ARC Raiders betas carries over into the game’s full release.</strong></p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Playtest</a> to initial betas, you’ve likely racked up many hours of gameplay. Killed robots, being killed by other players, and had a great time. Well, they have to stay as memories, as anything you’ve achieved until now is (ironically) wiped.</p>



<p>It’s a clean slate from October 30. It goes without saying, though, that you have an advantage if you have registered any beta hours.</p>



<p>Let us know if you’re happy that ARC Raiders doesn’t have a mandatory wipe. Is it the perfect answer to people who hate losing all their progress playing Escape From Tarkov? You know what to do.

			<p>Way back when it was announced, Playtonic’s Yooka-Laylee attracted a huge amount of excitement and anticipation, promising to bring back the lost art of the collectathon 3D platformer. With ex-Rare devs leading the way, and their former employer subject to the whims of Microsoft’s inner workings, fans were hoping that the lizard and bat combination would resurrect the golden age of Banjo-Kazooie et al. The end result was one of the biggest disappointments in gaming memory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Yooka-Laylee</a> wasn’t a complete disaster but felt unfinished and strangely empty, especially in the later levels. The 2D spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review/">Impossible Lair</a> was far more complete and therefore better received but it was clear that Playtonic felt that there was unfinished business with the first game. Enter Yooka-Replaylee.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/spXZHz4ZXUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee is the updated and fully fleshed out version of the original pitch that fans were excited for back in the day. The visuals have had a major overhaul, the levels filled with new challenges, and the game mechanics given a new lease of life. It’s no exaggeration to say that this is the definitive Yooka-Laylee experience and I hope that it reaches the wider audience that it deserves.</p>


<p>The visual upgrade is the first thing to hit you upon starting up the game. I played on Switch 2, predominantly handheld, and the new palette really pops on the screen. It also looked fantastic when docked with smooth performance and a much improved camera. The different levels really stand out with the increased graphical detail, leading to environments that are far more interesting to explore. Exploration is also required as there are double the number of pagies to collect and many new minigames and trials to complete.</p>


<p>Just in case you are new to the series, let’s go through some background. Yooka and Laylee are best friends that live on a pirate ship. One is a lizard and one is a bat, with the latter living on Yooka’s back in much the same way that Kazooie lived in Banjo’s backpack. They have the same kind of friendly banter and back-and-forths, and share many of the same platforming skills of their spiritual predecessors. Whilst relaxing on their ship one day, they meet a magical book that offers power to its owner. Before they can get too comfortable, though, the evil Capital B steals the book and scatters its pages throughout the lands. It is therefore up to the dynamic duo to explore the various levels and rescue the Pagies.</p>
<p>The original game had a system of unlocks that meant you had to buy skills as you progressed and return to levels to find Pagies that were unavailable first time around. One of the most transformative changes in the new version is that all of the skills are at your disposal from the very start. This makes it possible to completely clear a level before moving on if you want to go for 100% and removes the need to backtrack. This doesn’t mean that completion is easy, though, as there are still some fiendishly hidden collectables and challenging minigames to beat in order to collect everything.</p>

<p>You begin your quest to collect the Pagies in the overworld hub. This area contains the entrances for the five levels, each with 50 Pagies to collect, as well as 50 Pagies of its own. Accessing each level requires you to have a set amount of Pagies, but this amount has not been altered from the original, so it is actually possible to reach the final confrontation with Capital B after rinsing just the first two levels and the overworld to meet its 120 Pagies goal. This is a peculiar choice as it makes much of the new content feel far more optional than it should. There isn’t even an achievement for collecting every Pagie, which seems like a bizarre choice. I only briefly touched the last two levels in my playthrough, but know I will be returning to mop up the rest of the collectables at some point.</p>
<p>It’s not just Pagies, as there are also 150 Quills, currency that you can use to buy upgrades from Trowser the Snake, 5 Ghosts with different approaches to collect them, hidden pig characters to find, an Arcade coin for Rex’s retro arcade machine, a Mollycule for Dr Puzz, coins to spend with Vendi the Vending Machine, 8 Pagie fragments, and even more. The collectathon is the game here, with narrative being restricted to entertaining cutscenes as you unlock each Pagie door – another clear influence from Banjo-Kazooie.</p>

<p>Each level is well designed to hide all of these many collectables and you’ll need to scour every nook and cranny to find them all, as well as fully exploit Yooka and Laylee’s abilities to traverse complex platforming sections with impressive verticality. Enemies are frequent with different varieties for each biome and there are fun boss battles that reward victory with 3 Pagies. Less fun are the returning mine cart sections that remain just as frustrating as ever. Fortunately the huge excess of Pagies in this version means that you can ignore challenges or minigames that you don’t want to play. Perhaps the most radical redesign here is the Retro Rex Arcade minigame which now plays out with far more substance than originally.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Yooka-Replaylee isn’t just the definitive version of the game; it’s one of the most enjoyable 3D platformers this side of Nintendo first party titles or Astro Bot. The levels are now packed with things to do, the range of different challenges keeps things interesting, and the upgrades and equippable tonics enable you to customise the difficult to suit your playstyle. All in all, this is now an essential purchase for fans of 3D platformers.	</p></div>

            <p>
First-person undersea scare-o-puzzler Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss launches April 16, 2026, as announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies showcase of less than blockbustery videogame darlings</a>. It kind of looks like a marginally more combative Soma with less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-a-nod-to-nietzsche-in-soma-got-me-thinking-twice-about-that-suffocating-buzzword-immersion">philosophical subtext</a>, which sounds like a solid Friday night to me. It's also an opportunity for some hipfire scattergun commentary about the Lovecraftian premise of sights beyond comprehension, and how this gels with videogames, an artform that has "video" in the title. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As described on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2760560/Cthulhu_The_Cosmic_Abyss/">Steam</a>, Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss sees you and a sinister chatbot accomplice exploring Cthulhu's prison, the ancient submerged city of R'lyeh, while resisting "the creeping madness caused by Cthulhu's influence". You've found your way there while investigating a lost mining station, deep beneath the Pacific.</p>
<p>There's a secret at the heart of R'lyeh "that could shatter your understanding of reality". All this talk of madness and shattering notwithstanding, the release date trailer deals in familiar Lovecraftian imagery. There are tentacles, fish monsters, mutated humans, and streets of snotty, graven stone that spiral upwards and downwards in frightful ways.

<p>
I was going to do my usual routine of putting my hands on my hips and saying "well that doesn't look very incomprehensibly cosmically horrible to <em>me</em>, it looks like a bunch of feisty trout people, upside-down windows and flagrant Orientalism". But this kind of thing is perfectly in keeping with Lovecraft's own descriptions of Cthulhu, which are nowhere near as fancy as I'd love them to be. "The Thing cannot be described," he writes in <a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx">The Call of Cthulhu</a>. "There is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled." Then he proceeds to talk about Cthulhu being green and greasy with big "flabby" claws and a squid for a head. 
</p><p>
I generally think that the better recent "Lovecraftian" cosmic horror seizes upon Lovecraft's artier abstractions and twists them further. For example, I find R'lyeh itself a lot more intriguing than the depiction of absolute unit squidman Cthulhu. Lovecraft's narrator in the story makes a loose connection to futurism, the Italian early 20th century art movement that dealt in worlds smashed and hastened by combustion engines and electricity, producing city paintings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Street_Enters_the_House">like this one</a>.</p>
<p>"Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city," Lovecraft's awestruck voyager expounds, "for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--surfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs." 
</p>
<p>
I'd love to play a Lovecraftian game that runs with that analogy and puts Euclidean geometry under more artful stress, rather than just bending what could otherwise be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> 3 maps in silly ways. I'm not sure you can pursue such ideas in Unreal Engine, much as The Cosmic Abyss may decorate its cavern roofs with inverted masonry - Unreal Engine games come with a certain built-in visual register and audience expectations. Still, perhaps that shattering secret at the heart of the game will surprise me. It looks like they have a black hole down there. Always keen on a black hole somewhere it shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of black holes, I will tell you about my one moment in a videogame that compares to Lovecraft's account of cracking the seal on R'lyeh and - in the seconds before Johnny Octochops emerges - encountering a "tenebrousness" that has an ambiguous "positive quality", bursting forth "like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings". It was while playing <a href="https://zenorogue.itch.io/relative-hell">Relative Hell</a>, which I've written about here and there. It's a shmup that, to pack everything down, models <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space">ideas about spacetime</a> I do indeed struggle to describe, inasmuch as my own subject-verb-object grammar is a product of 'classical physics'.
</p><p>
In every game of Relative Hell I've played, I've slid off the surface of legible reality and found myself at large in a frictionless yet enveloping dark sphere with coloured gameplay props smeared around its profile. I cannot work out what it means to move in that sphere and it scares the shit out of me. The developer's notes don't help. Here is one: "in the pause mode, when you advance/revert the time, you can see a dark circle -- this represents your "future", that is, the area reached by the light you emit currently (you can theoretically affect this future), or "past", the area you would have seen by now." If the shadows parted and Cthulhu appeared, it would be a relief, frankly.
