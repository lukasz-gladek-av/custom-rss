A quick tap fires a “small curse bullet” that lands directly in front of you.</p><p>Touching the deployed curse field curses both enemies and yourself! Holding the button charges a “large curse bullet” that flies far. The initial shockwave can erase enemy bullets and grants brief invincibility!</p><p>Cursed enemies continuously take damage. Defeating them yields many score items!</p><p>When you’re cursed, your power and speed increase for a certain time.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there-is-no-getting-back-on-this-ride.1183848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Because I work in a nerd-adjacent field, I've been asked a lot over the last few weeks whether I was going to go and see <em>Thunderbolts</em>, and every time I'm asked I give the same answer: lol absolutely not.</p><p>This is not because I am pre-emptively criticising an individual film without having seen it, or that I am giving shit to those who <em>are </em>excited to go see it. For all I know this could be a fun little superhero romp, a lighthearted couple of hours spent in a cinema watching actors blow shit up. But then, this is not really an individual film, is it? It's a mere chapter, the latest instalment in a movement that lost me (and a lot of other people) a long time ago and will likely never get us back.</p><p>You can point to all kinds of factors behind the colossal success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe between 2008 (when <em>Iron Man</em> was released) and 2019 (when<em> Avengers: Endgame</em> hit cinemas), and whichever one you point to--the chemistry, the humour, the effects--would be a fair point. I've always figured the series' success was broadly based on something more fundamental, though, something that goes beyond the merits of any of the individual films or the people involved in making them.</p><p>Comic books are modern mythology, a cornerstone of Western popular culture (and American in particular), but they have also grown over the decades into an impenetrable mess of conflicting canon, characters and storylines. You can say that you love Superman, and I will believe you, but the average person has not read an actual Superman comic since they were a kid, if ever, because to commit yourself to reading superhero comics is to subject yourself to the torment of burying yourself under almost a century of bullshit.</p><p>That's why even at points in my life when I have been super into comics, and there have been several, I was never really into Marvel or DC stuff. I sought out fresher stories with a clean plate, like <em>Tom Strong</em> and <em>Planetary</em>, whose sagas I could get a handle on from beginning to end, not those with encyclopaedic levels of baggage behind every character, location and reference.</p><p>The real strength of the MCU was that it felt the same way. It brought us everything great about comics--the adventures, the escapades, the one-liners--but without any of the burden. <em>Iron Man</em>, <em>Thor</em>, <em>Captain America</em>–all these film series started from scratch, and so millions of people around the world were able to watch as these movies told new and self-contained stories, despite the fact they all starred very old characters.</p><p>Or, at least, that <em>was</em> the strength of the MCU until <em>Endgame</em>. The conclusion of the <em>Avengers </em>saga left Disney and Marvel with a void to fill, and instead of filling it with whatever a new generation's version of the MCU could have been, they just started shovelling whatever leftover and rebaked slop they could find in there instead. So we got a succession of TV shows and movies that felt cast adrift from the series that broke box office records, full of new actors in old costumes and brighter spotlights on lesser characters, each one telling a new story but also one that wove into those that had come before.</p><p>As these films and shows began piling up, that central appeal of the MCU began to wane. The whole point was that these were simple stories for the masses that you could partake in every few months, as good-to-amazing films hit the big screen through that 2008-2019 run. But when those simple stories started continuing in movies less people were seeing and cross-referencing the events of TV shows even <em>less </em>people had seen, that created problems.</p><p>I first noticed this a few years back, when I found that it was becoming a struggle to keep up with everything. I don't know if it was the volume of information I was now supposed to be retaining or just that the quality of the films and shows that were conveying it had gone downhill, but somewhere around that first slate of TV shows (<em>Wandavision</em>, <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>) and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> (2022), staying in step with the wider Marvel narrative had stopped being a pleasure and had started feeling like a chore.</p><p>I used to be into the Marvel movies because, for the most part, they were fantastic big-screen adventures. I followed the story because I <em>wanted </em>to follow it, but lately it's been more about obligation than pleasure, Marvel keeping you forever hostage, because how could you possibly enjoy <em>Captain America VII: Shield Party</em> if you haven't seen the Disney + series <em>Black Widow Goes To Washington</em>, which itself only makes sense if you know the backstory from <em>Hawkeye Nearly Died Under A Snow Plough</em>?</p><p>I finally hit my breaking point by the end of <em>Loki's </em>second season. I made it all the way through to the final episode, one that was piling increasing amounts of intrigue and major new villain reveals into the canon, before turning it off only a few minutes in, because...well, everything I've just said hit me within a few seconds of stark realisation, like a bucket of cold water being dumped on my head. I haven't watched a single Marvel movie or TV show since.</p><p>And let me tell you, it feels <em>great</em>. Where even five years ago I would be watching Marvel trailers and then movies like they were homework, I now see brief mentions of announcements on my social media timelines and feel nothing. I can't recommend it enough. It's liberating. Every hour of the last three years that I would have been stuffing Marvel slop into my brain I've instead been doing quite literally anything else, from playing with my kids to helping run a website to watching, gasp, other types of movies.</p><p>To make that break, though, means making the break. You can't step off the ride then try to get back on later while it's still moving, not without a ton of homework that would defeat the point of getting off in the first place. I have no idea what <em>Thunderbolts</em>' deal even is! I half-recognise people from old movies, I see some assholes from TV shows I did not enjoy and have stopped watching, and I have no idea what they're doing here or why I should care. Being off the ride really highlights how much of a ride it is; that somewhere along the line the MCU stopped being about making cool movies (that made billions of dollars) and started being, like so much else in our modern hellscape, about user retention.</p><p>Which has worked for Disney, to a point: even in its reduced state, Marvel stuff still makes a lot of money, still has millions of fans around the world who keep turning up again and again to consume it, and I'm so tired of criticising stocks-addled movie executives that I can't even fault them for trying to make the line keep going up, as much as I can't get angry at a dog for barking.</p><p>As a result of that greed, though, and a complete inability to let go of the golden goose that was the MCU, Disney has created something so much more than a series of fun movies that all tied into one another. They've created an obligation, a cultural job you need to clock in for to keep getting paid, and like all shitty jobs, there are few things on Earth that feel better than quitting and never going back.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished"><h3>He Did It</h3></a><p>Far and away the biggest Grand Theft Auto-related news of the day</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His story recounts events that transpired throughout 2017 or, according to Darrah, “the most impactful 12 months in BioWare’s history.” He touches on not only decisions that affected the early development of last year’s Dragon Age game but how a change in attitude was tied to the final days of development on Mass Effect: Andromeda.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It starts in late 2016, when Darrah was moved over to the team that would handle the last stages of development on Andromeda. He says his “feeling at the time” was that the Dragon Age team felt “jerked around” and had “no support from BioWare or EA.” The hope was that Darrah could aid in getting Mass Effect out the door so the next Dragon Age could utilize more resources, though this ultimately didn’t quite pan out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This was the first time where we had this leadership discontinuity, where the person in charge of a project left that project to help someone else, some other project, while the project continued to run,” Darrah explained. “In the cast of Mass Effect: Andromeda, I don’t think the impact to Dragon Age was huge. It wasn’t very long, but it did set this precedent as this being a thing that we could do, and it’s not a good thing to do. It is incredibly dangerous to have a project run while it’s missing some of its core leadership.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect: Andromeda launched in March 2017 and, in Darrah’s own words, “it doesn’t go well.” Throughout this time, BioWare was still adjusting to a structural change that saw the team reporting to new leadership at EA that was “hyper interested” in its projects and plans. He calls the change dramatic, noting that the studio’s new bosses weren’t interested in continuing work on Mass Effect due to its recently troubled launch. However, Darrah didn’t feel like Dragon Age was getting the support it needed even after Andromeda was shipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The former BioWare lead says he approached current EA CEO Andrew Wilson and former EA executive Patrick Söderlund with his concerns and was reassured of Dragon Age’s importance to the company. While EA offered few resources in an attempt to maintain the studio’s work in the summer of 2017, Darrah along with the rest of the BioWare staff were told that studio veteran Casey Hudson would be returning. It was a major shakeup that staff was made aware of without notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have to remember: I am the second most senior person at BioWare,” Darrah said. “Casey was interviewed, and hired, and prepared to be brought back entirely without me being consulted in any way. Would me have being involved in the process have changed the decision? No, I don’t think it would have, but there is an immense amount of disrespect involved in making a hire of this impact, in making a decision of this import, without involving the second-most senior person at your studio in any way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah then predicted that BioWare would shift its focus to Anthem. When his concerns were shared with EA, he was told that leadership was committed to giving Dragon Age the attention it deserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we all know, that’s not what happened at all,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s interest in Anthem ballooned until its similarly troubled launch in 2019, all while Darrah felt his trust in the company was being “constantly hammered” and “constantly challenged.” Resources were continuously pulled away from what would eventually be known as Dragon Age: The Veilguard all the way through 2019, leading to what Darrah says were “fundamental” changes to the nature of the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: The Veilguard would go on to release in late 2024 as BioWare’s latest AAA fantasy RPG. Despite positive reviews from critics (we gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">our review</a>), EA painted its launch as a letdown, saying in February that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed-to-resonate-with-a-broad-audience-gamers-increasingly-want-shared-world-features"><u>failed to “resonate with a broad enough audience.”</u></a> These were comments former BioWare developers later pushed back on, with some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-co-creator-offers-ea-some-advice-follow-baldurs-gate-3-developer-larians-lead"><u>suggesting the company should follow the lead set up by Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many Dragon Age developers were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laid off in January of this year</a> as the studio shifted its focus back to Mass Effect 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <p>
A year and a half after Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69bn, the US Federal Trade Commission's continuing attempts to block the deal might finally have come to an end following the 9th Circuit Court's decision to deny its appeal of a 2023 lower court ruling.
</p>
<p>
The FTC has been battling Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard since it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">proposed in 2022</a>, arguing - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">antitrust lawsuit filed in December that year</a> - the deal would "harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets." After a substantial amount of legal back and forth throughout 2023, the US courts (alongside regulatory bodies around the world) cleared the way for Microsoft's deal to proceed, and proceed it did.
</p>
<p>
However, despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition was completed in October 2023</a>, the FTC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-resumes-case-against-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard">continued to petition the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, asking it to overturn a lower court's July 2023 decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftcs-final-attempt-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-has-failed">not to issue a preliminary injunction halting Microsoft's deal</a>. However, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/">reported by Reuters</a>, the 9th Circuit Court has now upheld the earlier ruling, saying the lower court "applied the correct legal standards" and that the FTC failed to provide sufficient evidence Microsoft's deal would lessen competition.
</p>
<p>
In order to pursue its case further, the FTC would need to convince the US Supreme Court to overturn the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling, or it could resume its own internal administrative action that was put on hold in 2023 pending the 9th Circuit's decision. But with a new US administration in power and a new Trump-appointed chairman helming the FTC, the agency's focus may now be elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for Microsoft, it has been reaping the benefits of its $69bn acquisition since the deal was finalised in 2023; the company's Q1 2025 financial report showed a substantial 61 percent year-on-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue, largely thanks to Activision Blizzard.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Control 2, the next big single-player game from Remedy, will be made on a smaller budget than its last single-player feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, chief executive officer Tero Virtala confirmed.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/remedys-next-big-game-is-being-made">Game File,</a> Virtala spoke about how this will be done, and how it's about Remedy learning from past mistakes to go "<em>from surviving to succeeding</em>."</p>
<p>Virtala says that €50 million is what he thinks the studio needs to make a good Remedy game, and that's the budget Control 2 has, which is slightly less than what Alan Wake 2 cost to make. Remedy has always been known for creating exceptional single-player experiences that have critics raving about them, but they're never able to achieve the massive commercial success that other single-player games of the same ilk can achieve.</p>
<p>Even Alan Wake 2, for example, only recently surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/">2 million copies sold</a> since its 2023 launch. That's not to say 2 million isn't a huge milestone, but it makes you scratch your head when you think about the fact that Alan Wake 2 is widely agreed to be one of the best single-player games and narrative experiences in video games in years. It gave Baldur's Gate III a real run for its money when everyone thought Baldur's Gate was a shoo-in for game of the year. And yet, Alan Wake 2 is well behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-reportedly-sold-15-million-copies-vincke-hopes-next-gen-tech-will-bring-his-dream-rpg-closer/">Baldur's Gate III's 15+ million copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>It's not surprising, therefore, to learn that Remedy is looking to streamline its process, so it can still make the kinds of games it is renowned for, without fear that it won't survive.</p>
<p>Control 2 is currently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-full-production-remedy/">full production</a>, but in the meantime, Remedy's next game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/">FBC Firebreak</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game set within the world of Control, which is due out next month on June 17, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>

More than a decade has passed between <em>GTA V</em> and <em>GTA VI</em>, and Rockstar is clearly not taking that lightly. It seems impossible to think that the most anticipated game release ever can live up to the hype. Whether the game as a whole does or doesn’t, though, it sure looks like the beer bottles will. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> is a new Metroid-like adventure from Raccoon Logic Studios, which kicks off by dropping you on some backwater planet in space, with no gear, no backup on the way, and pretty much nothing at your disposal besides your wits and what you can salvage from your ship's wreckage.</p>
<p>It's a very open-ended start to the game, and you'll see your quest list fill up faster than you can get to everything on it. But there are a few tasks that you should prioritize, and a few gameplay&nbsp; when you land in Nu Florida, to really get the best experience possible out of your time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<h2>Best Tips For Starting Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<h3>ABS - Always Be Scanning/Surveying</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>While the whole opening premise of Revenge of the Savage Planet is that you're dropped on this planet with nothing, there are plenty of resources in the wreckage from your ship, the tech that Alta Interglobal has left behind, and just the natural resources from the planets you visit, that you can use to make your journey easier. Scanning everything you can is also part of your character's progression, so whenever you enter a new area, it's worth jumping into the scanner mode to see if anything is highlighted orange, which means it hasn't yet been scanned.</p>
<p>The second part of this is to always be surveying the area. If you're playing on a controller, then you're going to be constantly clicking R3. This helps you keep the direction you're heading in top of mind, because it's very easy to lose track of your goal otherwise.</p>
<h3>Get Your Upgrades Sorted</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are plenty of upgrades you can shoot for at the top of the game, and you'll hit all the key ones by going through the main questlines, like adding a grapple to your whip. But there are a few you also need to prioritize from the start. No fall damage is a huge one, for example, that you should clear as soon as you can. Same goes for getting a double-jump, though that is unfortunately more involved than it should be, since you need to complete multiple environmental tasks to get to the point where you can unlock the double-jump upgrade. Upgrading your mask to filter out toxic gas is another that you'll want to get as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Basically, if it's to do with exploration and movement, you should focus on doing it as soon as you can. It's worth your time to jump to the next planet and progress the story to hit some of these key upgrades that can make the time you spend just exploring each planet you go to a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>Isolate Before You Capture</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>In the same way you'll want to scan everything, you'll want to capture all the fauna you encounter in Revenge of the Savage Planet. In some cases, doing so is pretty straightforward. Some of them don't require you to stun them first, you can sneak up and grab them with your whip. Most, however, will require that you engage them in combat and hit a weak spot a few times before you can whip them and pull them into what looks like a wormhole, transporting them back to your home base. Any damage you take while pulling them into the wormhole will stop you from being able to pull them in, and you'll have to redo the whole capture process.</p>
<p>There are often multiples of the kinds of creatures you'll be looking to capture all hanging out together, and trying to capture one of them in a scenario where the rest will surely catch on to what you're doing is a recipe for disaster. Until you've eaten enough of the orange goo you'll find on each planet, and even after you've upgraded your health and stamina significantly, you're very squishy. You'll die faster than you think if you aren't careful with how you approach a group of creatures, and you need to capture at least one of each to research them and unlock more upgrades for yourself.</p>
<p>So don't just try and pull one in if it's not completely safe. The animation for doing so is far slower than I would have liked it to be, and while Raccoon Logic could make it a tad faster, that feels unlikely. Best to be prepared and plan your capture strategy when approaching a new group of creatures you haven't researched yet.</p>
<h3>Avoid combat whenever possible</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>You gain some resources from killing the local fauna on each planet, and you're often thrown into scenarios where you need to fight your way out. But when you're exploring the planets you visit, avoid combat as often as you can.</p>
<p>It'll be difficult because many creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet are hostile just from you walking by them, so you'll hear the combat music start and stop plenty of times throughout your playthrough. But trust me when I say it's a much better use of your time to try and find resources in the environment through whatever objective you have or environmental puzzles you find. Those will always give you more resources than random combat scenarios will.</p>
<h3>Your Blaster Sucks On Purpose, Use Everything Around You Instead</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>The blaster you start the game with, for the most part, sucks. But it sucks for a reason, which is that you're not meant to just pull out your blaster with every hostile creature you face. It'll help you, for sure, but you're also meant to use the environment around you. Don't just rely on your blaster to take care of everything.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not because your blaster won't be able to handle whatever you come across. It will, but it won't be as effective, or as efficient, as the environmental hazards you can use to your advantage. Especially after you've unlocked the ability to fire various kinds of goo.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are the main things you'll want to know when starting Revenge of the Savage Planet, and if you keep them in mind, you're sure to have a smooth start in the game's early hours.</p>

New bundles will go live each weekday, meaning there will be at least eight new game bundles total during Bundlefest Spring 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Kicking things off is a new <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Fanatical+Bundlefest+Kicks+Off+With+Five+Roguelike+Games+For+%245&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-05-07+14%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-07+14%3A02%3A19&amp;fnarticle_id=6531381&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fkiller-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-bundlefest-spring-2025-cheap-video-game-bundles%2F1100-6531381%2F%3Fftag%3DGSS-05-10aac1i&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killer Bundle</a> with <strong>five roguelike action games $5</strong>.

                <p>Nintendo might be synonymous with video games today, but the company actually got its start as a playing card company. Founded in 1889, Nintendo originally produced Hanafuda--a type of card used to play a variety of games dating back to the 16th century. Playing cards are obviously no longer Nintendo’s main attraction, but the gaming giant hasn't forgotten its humble playing card roots. Nintendo has continued to release card decks, albeit not as many these days, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Legend-Zelda-Trump-Playing/dp/B005XR3K5M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">traditional 52-card Legend of Zelda</a>- and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Super-Mario-Playing-Not-Specified/dp/B003PDUQBM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario-themed decks</a> as well as unique <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Mario-playing-cards-red/dp/B01683O7BA?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hanafuda cards featuring characters from the Mushroom Kingdom</a>.</p><p>Nintendo playing cards are primarily sold in Japan, though a bunch of imported decks have popped up on Amazon over the years. Prices tend to change often because you're buying from resellers with limited stock, but the decks typically ship from Amazon and some even have Prime shipping.

            <p>
A day after dropping jaws and making the recently anounced delay even tougher to bare, Rockstar has confirmed GTA 6's hugely impressive second trailer was a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">second trailer dropped earlier this week</a>, offering a closer look at its world - which includes the return of the Miami-inspired Vice City - and its sprawling cast of characters than we saw in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">2023's scene-setting first showing</a>. Rockstar subsequently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">detailed character breakdowns</a> and dozens upon dozens of screenshots for eager fans to scrutinise still further.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, plenty of chatter immediately ensued, some of it lauding the incredible amount of detail on display, some of it frantically sharing screen captures of Jason's rippling torso, and some of it casting doubt on the little note at the end of the trailer claiming it was all captured on PS5. At the very least, people speculated, Rockstar must have <em>surely</em> meant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>?
</p>

<p>
But the developer has now moved to quell any lingering doubts, suggesting that, yes, everything we saw in its most recent trailer was indeed generated by Sony's now nearly five-year-old console, and all of it was in-game. "Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5," the studio <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">confirmed in a statement shared on social media</a>, "comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; let dazzlement and bewonderment be yours. The downside to all this excitement, of course, is that GTA 6 is still some considerable way off following its recent delay. Publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">previously</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">repeatedly</a> insisted GTA 6 would launch this autumn, but last week - after months of reports suggesting a delay was likely - Rockstar announced a new release date of 26th May next year, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."
</p>
<p>
And while its new release date leaves a big GTA-shaped hole in the 2025 release schedule, it does at least mean publishers previously unwilling to commit to launch dates for their own titles fearing GTA 6's dominance are likely now moving quickly to fill the void. Earlier this year, game execs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-publishers-talk-challenges-of-gta-6-launch-in-new-report-we-dont-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">bemoaned the "havoc" Grand Theft Auto 6's lack of a release date</a> was causing, with one saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
With a full year still to go until GTA 6's arrival on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, it might be some time before Rockstar reveals more. But for those keeping track, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know so far</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/indie-ttrpg-studio-rowan-rook-and-decard-not-attending-gencon-2025-over-travel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie tabletop studio Rowan, Rook, and Decard will not attend GenCon 2025 this year. The indie TTRPG studio stated this decision was a result of recent actions by the US government, specifically their recent abductions and deportations of foreign visitors.</p>



<p>In a post on their official <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/were-not-coming-to-gencon-this-year/?v=0b3b97fa6688" rel="nofollow">website</a>, Rowan, Rook, and Decard explained why their UK-based employees will not attend GenCon 2025. The explanation is simple: crossing the border to the US isn't safe for them, and they doubt the situation will improve.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rowan-rook-and-decard-eat-the-reich-artwork.jpg?itok=iR35kgxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rowan-rook-and-decard-eat-the-reich-artwork.jpg?itok=Zwsw3Vbk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This statement is in response to recent activity by the US government towards overseas visitors. Ostensibly under a strict anti-immigration campaign enforced by ICE, people can be held indefinitely without charge, and even deported from the United States. This has happened to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/12/ice-tourist-detention-border-trump-immigration/82740260007/" rel="nofollow">several tourists</a> with visas, and even a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained?ref=rascal.news" rel="nofollow">French scientist</a> who was critical of President Trump.</p>

<p>Complicating matters further is, due to the methodology of ICE, those that are detained can be done on dubious grounds. The most high-profile of these wrongful detainments is Columbia University student and activist <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/third-circuit-rejects-governments-attempt-to-move-mahmoud-khalils-habeas-case-out-of-new-jersey" rel="nofollow">Mahmoud Khalil</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t the first to make this decision; we suspect we won’t be the last, either; the political climate is only getting worse. While the odds of most of us encountering resistance at border control are low, we don’t want to risk running the biggest convention of the year without the members of staff we need because they’ve been detained, deported, or otherwise penalised for their beliefs or who they are.</p>

<p>Obviously we’re upset about this, and we’re angry at the situation that makes this the best course of action. We want to come to GenCon. We want to be part of what we believe is one of the best conventions in the world, and what represents a huge outpouring of enthusiasm for play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;As a result, the usual events run Rowan, Rook, and Decard will not be happening at GenCon 2025. This includes their schedule of multi-table games, their VIP box stadium games, or their annual pizza and whiskey party.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there will be some representation of the indie studio's work at the event. Courtesy of their US partners, the studios games will be sold at the event. These include their most well-known work like <em>Honey Heist</em>, <em>Eat The Reich</em>, and <em>Heart</em>.</p>

<p>The hostile environment to foreign visitors is but one recent action by the Trump Administration that has negatively affected the tabletop industry. The recent import tariffs on Chinese goods has sent shockwaves through the industry, causing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studios</a> to close.</p>

We already knew that this new sequel would feature the couple in a big way, but that trailer seems to suggest that Rockstar is aiming to make them a believable, relatable, and dare I say, cute couple. </p><p>One moment that really stuck out to me in the trailer as something we’ve never really seen in a <em>GTA </em>game before happens at the very end. Jason is laying on the couch half asleep and watching TV. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?t=136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?t=136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia enters the living room, tosses her keys on the table and collapses onto Jason to cuddle with him</a></span>. It’s the kind of moment that most people in loving relationships have experienced. Your significant other gets back from a big trip, a hard day at work, or some other grueling experience and lands directly next to or on top of you for some comfort and love. It’s a cute and genuine moment. And it’s in the middle of a <em>GTA </em>trailer! Strange. </p><p>This is a franchise that has mostly treated relationships as jokes. Think back to how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/F7jad1GGH6Q?t=37&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/F7jad1GGH6Q?t=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CJ and Catalina are portrayed in <em>GTA San Andreas</em></a></span><em>.</em> She’s a lunatic and frequently called horrible names. Similarly, in <em>GTA V </em>Michael’s relationship with his wife is shown to be a mostly toxic and hostile experience that only gets better at the end due to violence. There’s also the bit in<em> GTA V</em> where Trevor kidnaps an old woman and they fall in love. And the earlier <em>GTA </em>games, like <em>Vice City</em>, mostly treated relationships as silly punchlines about how women are annoying and controlling. In <em>GTA 3</em>, after saving the woman he apparently “loves,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/dtmXd0iaL5o?t=455&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/dtmXd0iaL5o?t=455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude shoots her offscreen for talking too much</a></span>! Yikes. The closest<em> GTA</em> has ever gotten to a real relationship is Nico and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_McReary&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_McReary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate in <em>GTA IV</em></a></span>. But that’s barely part of the game, and if you choose the wrong option she gets gunned down by the end. </p><p>However, in the trailer for <em>GTA 6,</em> we see Jason and Lucia being a real couple. They seem genuinely enthralled with each other. The moment where Jason picks Lucia up out of prison and they smile warmly for a second is so unlike anything in <em>GTA </em>before. And throughout the trailer we see them snuggling, getting intimate, holding each other, kissing, dancing together, and even at one point holding hands. In a series that has featured so much violence and sex, it’s surreal to see two people in love and holding hands. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-recommend-id="image://afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-recommend-id="image://afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now the real question is: will Rockstar be able to pull off a full 30-70 hour game featuring a relatable and caring relationship? I don’t know. We are truly in uncharted waters for this franchise right now. But I hope they nail it. I think if Jason and Lucia’s relationship is the core of<em> GTA 6</em>'s story, it could help it not only stand out from past <em>GTA </em>games, but it could signal that Rockstar has grown up a bit.</p><p>Sure, it will still put in silly joke products and background signs that make me roll my eyes. But if, at the front and center of this massive AAA video game, there’s a realistic and well-done take on a real relationship between two people, that would be a wild accomplishment that I didn’t expect from a franchise famous for letting you kill sex workers to get your money back. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Inside, you'll find three separate rulebooks in English, French, and German, along with QR codes that link to quick video overviews in English, French, German, and Italian.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beneath the instruction booklets are four sturdy, double-sided player boards and a double-sided central board used for drafting tokens during gameplay. Each set of colorful wooden tokens comes packaged in its own plastic bag for organization during shipping, but you'll likely find it easier to store them all together in the included linen drawstring pouch. The tokens themselves are high-quality, surprisingly lightweight, and make a satisfyingly tactile sound as they rattle around in the bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The box includes a built-in organizer to keep components tidy before and after gameplay. One side of the organizer features a folding cardboard lid that holds a deck of Animal and Nature’s Spirit cards, along with a bag of small plastic orange and clear cubes that represent the animals. Like the box itself, the cards showcase vibrant, stunning artwork of various animals in their natural habitats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included are four double-sided reference cards – one for each player – that summarize how each biome is scored and provide a quick count of how many wooden tokens exist in each color. A small, colorful scoring pad makes it easy to tally up points at the end of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the built-in organizer is a welcome touch, you’ll need to give the wooden tokens in the linen pouch a quick shake and settle to get everything to fit properly; otherwise, the lid won’t sit flush with the box. That said, setup and teardown are incredibly fast, as there aren’t too many components to manage overall. Once everything’s packed away neatly, the compact box can be stored either horizontally or vertically on a shelf without any worry of components shifting or spilling inside.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal in Harmonies is to create a series of interconnected habitats for your animals by drafting and placing tokens on your player board to earn the highest score. After a quick setup, the first player chooses a set of three randomized tokens from the central board and places all of them on their personal board in any arrangement they like. However, once a token is placed, it can't be moved for the remainder of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Harmonies stand out is the ability to stack certain tokens, introducing a sense of verticality to the board and offering additional scoring opportunities if specific conditions are met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, brown tokens can serve as the base of a tree, but they don’t score on their own unless a green token is placed on top. Mountains, built using one to three grey tokens, only score if they're adjacent to at least one other mountain. Fields, represented by yellow tokens, score in pairs of two or more and can’t be stacked, while rivers (blue tokens) score progressively more points the longer you can connect them. Buildings are the most complex to grasp at first; they require a base token – either brown, gray, or red – topped with a red token, and they score a flat number of points if at least three uniquely colored tokens are adjacent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this alone would make for an interesting game, the real strategy emerges from drafting Animal cards. Each card features a specific configuration of tokens along the bottom that represents a unique habitat required by that animal. For instance, an alligator might need a swamp made up of a tree and a small river beside it, while meerkats prefer a rocky structure adjacent to a field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On each player’s turn, they have the option to draft one of the five available Animal cards and add it to their tableau, along with a set number of animal cubes that indicate how many times the depicted habitat must be built. Each time you successfully create the habitat shown on the card, you remove the bottommost animal cube and place it onto your player board, matching the habitat as pictured. As you remove cubes, you’ll earn an increasing number of points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no penalty for failing to complete an Animal card, but since you’re limited to four cards in your tableau at a time, choosing strategically is important. While it may be tempting to grab a bunch of animal cards early, you may find it difficult to complete the required habitats and miss out on valuable points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real strategy in Harmonies lies in optimizing the layout of habitats on your player board – maximizing the number of Animal cards you can complete while also keeping the base scoring of each biome in mind. At its core, Harmonies is an elegant optimization puzzle that presents a fresh challenge each time you play. While each player is primarily focused on their own personal board, there’s still a fair amount of interactivity, as you can block opponents from drafting certain sets of tokens or Animal cards that would perfectly complement their habitats.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Harmonies is an elegant optimization puzzle that presents a fresh challenge each time you play.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of each turn, players replenish the three tokens they took with a random draw from the pouch and reveal a new Animal card if they drafted one. This constant churn forces players to stay flexible – there’s rarely a chance to plan too far ahead, especially in higher player count games where more turns happen between your own. That unpredictability is exactly where Harmonies shines. Each turn carries a subtle urgency: you’re racing to complete as much as you can on your board before the game ends, all while juggling smart decisions and efficient token placement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the later rounds, it’s not uncommon to have a well-optimized player board that lets you draft Animal cards and score them immediately, without needing to build additional habitats. It’s a deeply satisfying payoff that rewards careful planning and can earn you some quick points as you push toward the end of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game ends when the pouch runs out of tokens or when any player has two or fewer unoccupied spaces left on their board, triggering the final round. After that, players tally up their points and declare a winner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you're comfortable with the base game, there are a few optional elements you can add in to shake up the gameplay. The first is the inclusion of Nature’s Spirit cards. At the beginning of the game, each player drafts one of two cards, each of which tasks you with building and completing a specific habitat in order to unlock an alternate scoring method for a particular biome. For example, you might earn extra points for building larger clusters of a specific terrain type, or for reaching certain heights with mountains or trees. These cards introduce new scoring opportunities and encourage you to rethink your usual strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a secondary side of the player board that changes how rivers score. Instead of creating one long, connected river, you’ll need to form islands by isolating sections of land with water tiles, adding another layer of spatial planning to the puzzle.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Harmonies Board Game</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harmonies also includes a dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> mode that offers a light score-chasing challenge with some surprisingly crunchy decisions, all wrapped up in a quick 10–20 minute playtime. The goal in this single-player variant is to collect as many suns as possible – a total based on your final score, the board side you used, and whether or not you played with Nature’s Spirit cards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Harmonies</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92xPkY?object_uuid=65874a49-0b36-43ad-bcc5-0c28f6f48fd8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0CVNPHPZY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGJWB?object_uuid=65874a49-0b36-43ad-bcc5-0c28f6f48fd8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a><em></em></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

A souped-up version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default">2012 Nintendo 3DS original</a>, this remaster brings the JRPG into the HD era, with sharp new graphics, a redesigned interface, the ability to fast forward through sections, and more. The game is available to preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/z6ovBj?object_uuid=b0a8463f-d0e5-4566-9df4-30c7ec70eeaa&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Target</a>). Read on for the details.</p><p id="bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-rem"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Rem">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</h2></p><div catalogid="e6542ab0-24e0-4939-8daa-bc1679b84a74" id="218139"><div id="218139" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBglmE?object_uuid=b0a8463f-d0e5-4566-9df4-30c7ec70eeaa&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXmZo?object_uuid=b0a8463f-d0e5-4566-9df4-30c7ec70eeaa&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at GameStop</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6ovBj?object_uuid=b0a8463f-d0e5-4566-9df4-30c7ec70eeaa&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a> - Not yet available</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41gGk?object_uuid=b0a8463f-d0e5-4566-9df4-30c7ec70eeaa&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a> - Not yet available</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheaper than you thought? It's cheaper than I thought it would be, anyway. That said, the price is probably owed somewhat to the fact that the physical copy doesn't include the game on the disk. It's a "game-key card," about which more below.</p></div><p id="this-is-a-game-key-card"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="This is a game-key card">Note: This is a Game-Key Card</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/bra-copy-1744651863602.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Nintendo Switch 2 games come on cards that contain the full game data. Others are more like a key to the game data, including this one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Game-key cards</a> are physical cards that look basically like Switch 2 cartridges, but they don’t actually contain the game on them. Instead, you’ll need to insert the card into your Switch 2 and download the 11GB game from the eShop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can, however, still lend the game (via the physical card) to a friend, or sell it. But in order to play it, you will need to insert the game-key card into your Switch 2.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What is Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it first came out on 3DS, Bravely Default was something of a throwback RPG in that it featured turn-based combat and revolved around a group of heroes on a quest to find four crystals. The main draw of the game is the unique combat system that lets you save up turns in order to take multiple actions all at once. It also has a deep job system that lets you assign new abilities to each of your party members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that is still present in this HD remaster, plus a number of other features. Now, in addition to the ability to fast forward through battles, you can breeze through cut scenes as well. You can still manipulate the encounter rate settings so you encounter more or fewer enemies depending on how you want to spend your time. There’s an online mode, plus new minigames. </p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">More Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-nintendo-switch-2">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition-switch-2">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Everything You Need To Know From The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</p>
      </div>
<p>Recording video and audio chats is not unique to Nintendo, and in fact this brings the company's approach in line with Xbox and PlayStation. Microsoft, for instance, states that it collects data from Xbox chat sessions, at least in part to power <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-live-will-let-you-share-voice-chat-clips-with-microsoft-to-fight-toxic-players/1100-6515906/" data-ref-id="1100-6515906">Xbox's voice chat reporting functionality</a> for safety enforcement. PlayStation party sessions and voice chat are also recorded to some extent for safety and security.</p><p>As voice and video chat functions have become more widespread and integral parts of gaming ecosystems, companies have rolled out increasingly sophisticated capabilities for recording, analyzing, and acting on the data that these produce. While it is often difficult to know the full extent of what companies are using this data for, much of it has to do with ensuring compliance with privacy and safety laws and enforcing community standards. Because of the legal ramifications of violations of some of these laws, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-3-uses-ai-to-listen-to-voice-chat-and-take-action-against-toxic-people/1100-6517338/" data-ref-id="1100-6517338">some specialist companies have emerged</a> to provide services in the voice and video chat safety space.</p><p>Right now, it is unclear exactly how Nintendo intends on using recordings for safety enforcement, and the company has not detailed what types of systems it will employ. We have reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update this story with any additional detail if we hear back. In the meantime, be sure to read all about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/" data-ref-id="1100-6530653">Switch 2's GameChat</a> and keep an eye on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">our Switch 2 preorder guide</a> if you're still trying to secure a console ahead of its June 5 release date.</p>

                <p>After receiving an in-depth trailer at the tail end of 2024, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6SRFLCF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> is now officially up for preorder on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC ahead of its July 24 release. The Soulslike RPG is set in Ming dynasty China--earning it comparisons to Black Myth: Wukong--and follows a pirate warrior as she attempts to unravel her past after suffering a bout of amnesia. Early footage reveals a stylish, fast-paced adventure, and reserving a copy in advance will unlock a few additional goodies. If you're interested in the upcoming action RPG, preorders are available now, including a physical Day 1 Edition and a digital Deluxe Edition, both of which include some extra DLC.
