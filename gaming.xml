		<p>Activision has responded after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was broadly accused of using AI-generated artwork – colloquially branded as ‘AI Slop’ – for things like player calling cards, posters, Prestige icons and more. Crucially, Activision admitted to the use of AI tools and did nothing to refute any of the specific claims over where it has been used.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/11/14/activision-responds-on-genai-use-in-black-ops-7/">Xbox Era</a>, Activision said, “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.” They make a slight distinction to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/">Insider Gaming</a>, adding “Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.”</p>


<p>This falls in line with the boilerplate disclosure on Steam that reads, “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.</p>
<p>So, basically, yes, Activision’s studios have been using AI to generate these incidental cosmetic items, and this goes hand-in-hand with some very generic, trend-following or art homages that the teams have made for many of these unlockables in the past.</p>
<p>One of the likeliest areas for AI slop that has been highlighted were the player calling cards that you can earn from completing certain mission goals and objective stats. A bunch of them have lifted a chunky cartoon art style that’s seemingly inspired by Studio Ghibli and anime art in general, completely at odds with the sci-fi war shooter that you’re earning them in. Death From Above shows a dragon burning the Icarus-like wings off someone’s back, while Reeled In shows villagers catching a fish that’s eaten a knight’s helmet.</p>


<p><em>(via <a href="https://xcancel.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619">@kumesicles</a>)</em></p>
<p>Another area is the icons that have been created for the various Prestige levels that you can work through by reseting online progress.</p>

<p><em>(via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-littered-with-ai-art-slop-because-your-70-means-nothing-anymore/">FRVR</a>)</em></p>
<p>The whole saga really boils down to the use of AI generation in video game development to replace the work of people, and this has become one of the most controversial points that plague games in the last couple years as examples of AI-generated work seep through to finished games, whether intended or not. Anno 117: Pax Romana, for example, had a piece of AI-generated art in the full release, where the intended use was for a scene to be generated and then re-drawn or touched up by humans to correct weird looking hands, faces and other areas. This obviously means than an artist is able to produce more finished works, and by extension, then the studio maybe needs fewer artists for a project than they would have 5 or 10 years ago. Similarly, Embark Studios, the team behind ARC Raiders and The Finals, has been created AI voice banks by paying actors for their exclusive rights and uses, which seems ethical on the surface, but it’s not clear if the studio pays ongoing royalties for new lines that they need to generate – this is now the SAG-AFTRA union expectation in the US.</p>
<p>And this really blurs the lines between what is and isn’t AI-generated, to me. Are the calling cards and emblems in Black Ops 7 AI generated? Probably. Has a human hand then been used to touch up errors and oddities? Probably. Is the end product consistent with previous Call of Duty games? Definitely.</p>
<p>Skipping back to 2015’s Black Ops 3 (via <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Calling_Cards/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_III#Multiplayer_">Fandom</a>), and the masses of calling cards in this game are, to be uncharitable, human artist slop. Where Black Ops 7 has Studio Ghibli (amongst many other themes), Black Ops 3 has steampunk toons, a whole riff on Conan the Barbarian, a whole bunch that could be colour-flipped panels from Watchmen (both the super hero stuff and the pirate side story).</p>
<p>That’s not to say that replacing human work with AI-generated work is acceptable in any case, but these do all feel pretty minimal effort. Activision and Microsoft make enough from Call of Duty that we should get the finest human artist slop in all the lands, but that’s not what it feels like we’re getting.</p>

			<p>Concord remains, for now, arguably the greatest commercial failure for Sony and PlayStation in the history of the PlayStation platform. <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">After just ten days on the market</a> between the end of August and the beginning of September 2024, Sony pulled it from store shelves and confirmed servers would go offline, rendering the online-only game unplayable for the few players who bought it. Fast forward to the last few days, and Concord was playable to those with a legal copy of the game courtesy of fan-made custom servers, until Sony killed it once again.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, it began with Sony issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos that were uploaded by the creators behind the project of them playing Concord on the custom servers they built. The takedowns were issued by a company listed as MarkScan, which is generally the face Sony uses to issue claims like this.</p>



<p>Though Sony wasn't directly targeting the project of building custom servers for Concord, just videos of gameplay on these custom servers, shortly after the takedowns came through, one of the lead developers behind the project stated in the Concord Delta Discord, "<em>Due to worrying legal action we've decided</em> <em>to pause invites for the time being</em>."</p>



<p>As previously stated, Sony hasn't attacked the actual project of building the custom servers. It's also worth noting that the developers were being extremely careful to remove and disallow any players from trying to share illegal copies of the game, and would only allow players who had legally obtained a copy of Concord. </p>



<p>"<em>I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do,</em>" the team wrote. "<em>We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files</em>."</p>



<p>So while Sony hasn't directly issued a takedown to the project itself, the indirect action of taking down the videos seems to have been enough for Sony to show the development team that it knows about what they are doing, and it will take every path it can to strike it down. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Cities: Skylines franchise is getting a new developer. Publisher Paradox announced on Monday that it was moving long-time developer Colossal Order off of the franchise in what is said to be a “mutual decision.</p>



<p>In a joint statement on the Paradox forums, Colossal Order is moving on to build new projects and explore “new creative opportunities.”</p>







<p><strong>“For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order,”</strong> <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen said</a>. <strong>“When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-meet-cities-skylines-new-developer">Meet Cities: Skylines New Developer</h2>



<p>Taking over the franchise will be another Finnish studio, Iceflake Studios. One of Paradox’s internal management studios, Iceflake will take over <strong>“all existing and future development for Cities: Skylines II, including free updates for the current version, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, as well as future expansions and content packs. This means that Cities players will be able to look forward to new updates and content drops for many years.”</strong></p>



<p>Colossal Order will continue on the game for a short time in order to implement in-progress updates like various bug fixes, the Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, and a Beta version of asset support for the game’s editor. After that, Iceflake will take over all development at the start of 2026.</p>







<p><strong>“Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility,”</strong> Iceflake studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said. <strong>“There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</strong></p>



<p>When making the announcement, there was no update on the console version of Cities: Skylines 2. The version has been delayed multiple times, and there’s been no update on when players can expect it. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask what this change means for the console version.</p>

                <p>The Entertainment Software Association has released the results of its annual holiday shopping survey, and the data shows that kids really want video games, but not as much as they want cash.</p><p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The ESA's survey found</a> that video games are among the top three things that kids want this holiday, with 58% of kids saying they would like games as gifts this year. Money and gift cards (69%) was the most sought-after gift for kids, followed by clothes/accessories (63%), and then video games at 58%.</p><p>The survey also found that 58% of kids want to play more video games with their parents; the percentage increases to 73% for kids ages 5-7, 66% for ages 8-9, and 62% for ages 10-12.</p><p>The ESA's survey also found that the most likely generation to ask for video games as gifts this holiday was Gen Alpha (ages 5-12), at 62%. Beyond games themselves, kids also want in-game currency (43%), some kind of gaming console (39%), physical games (37%), video game accessories (37%), or a video game subscription (32%).</p><p>Finally, the ESA survey found that, among parents who said they are planning to buy their children video games as gifts this year, they plan to spend an average of $736.83. That figure may look high, but games are generally more and more expensive these days, and consoles are ticking up in price, too, due in part to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>"Our research this year shows that kids not only want games, they also want quality time with their families. In a world where people feel increasingly disconnected, playing video games remains one of the easiest--and most fun--ways to stay close to the people we love," ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis said in a statement.</p><p>This survey was conducted by YouGov and the ESA via a five-minute online survey from September 26-30 this year. More than 1,900 people aged 5-65 took part in the study, the data for which was "weighted to be representative of the overall US population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, education and census region."</p>

            <p>Just this very moment, the first official photos from The Legend of Zelda live-action film were shown on the Nintendo today app.</p>
<p>These images show Bo Bragason as the titular Princess Zelda, complete with bow and arrow, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. We were treated to a shot of the duo looking out over Hyrule, as well as individual character images. </p>

<p>Ever since set footage from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-zelda-and-link-filming-the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-in-new-zealand">upcoming live-action Legend of Zelda movie adaption first came to light over the weekend</a>, I have been trying to piece together clues to work out which game the crew is adapting.</p>
<p>So, please allow me to take you through my thinking…</p>
<p>As you can see in the images below and above, our first look at Bo Bragason as Zelda show her in a blue tunic. In my mind, this put the film in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s timeline, where the Champions and the princess all largely wore a splash of blue in their day to day wear, be it tunics or sashes. The way Bragason's hair has been styled is also very Breath of the Wild. </p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group"><figure>

</figure></figure>
<p>However, after Zelda first appears in the footage, she then walks up to another character next to a horse. Many have surmised that this is Impa, a mainstay in the Zelda series. The thing is, Impa here is much younger than she appears in Breath of the Wild, even with the silver hair, and is wearing quite a knightly-looking garb. This in my mind then put the film into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> category, where Impa serves as a strong warrior.</p>

</figure>
</figure>
<p>Others online, meanwhile, have pointed out that the actress perhaps playing Impa in the film (the character has not been officially confirmed yet) looks a lot like the Impa seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">Skyward Sword</a>. This is canonically the game that started off the whole Zelda timeline. As for who the actress is, again we don't have official word yet but she appears to be Dichen Lachman. I first came across Lachman when she appeared in Neighbours as Katya Kinski, though she has since starred in the likes of Severance and Altered Carbon.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>@farourage via X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then, finally, we come to the Legend of Zelda series' main man, Link. In the film, he is played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who can be seen in set footage wearing Link's iconic green tunic ensemble. Again, this pushes my initial Breath of the Wild thoughts towards the back burner as while Link can certainly get green clothing in the series' most recent timeline, this is not what he wears in any of the key art or promotional images.</p>

<figcaption>While Link traditionally wears green in promotional images for Legend of Zelda games (as shown in the Twilight Princess artwork), for the most recent series releases he has worn blue.  | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, what can we conclude then? Well, in all honesty, I am not exactly sure which game in the Legend of Zelda series the film will be adapting, despite my initial thought being Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Perhaps the team will do something similar to what Sony tried to do with its Uncharted adaptation, and create a sort of melange of set pieces from across the Zelda series. Or, perhaps, we will be presented with an all new story for the Legend of Zelda…? What do you hope to see on the film's eventual release?</p>
<p>Filming for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation began earlier this month in New Zealand</a>, and is expected to run until April next year. The film is due to release on 7th May, 2027.</p>
<p>I will be keeping my eyes open for any more set leaks and cast announcements, so stay tuned. Personally, I am most interested to hear who will play Ganondorf.</p>

<figure data-uuid="580a5af1e1787"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza DLC Event" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/580a5af1e1787/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-event.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After the debut <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Emerald Rush</a> event wrapped up earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s <em>second</em> DLC in-game event is getting off to the races next week, with two particularly swanky reward statues up for grabs.</p>
<p>The 'So Strong It's Funny' event will get underway on <strong>25th November</strong> and will be hanging around until <strong>2nd December</strong>, so you have just one week to rack up a high score and pull in the bonus goodies.</p>
<p>And gosh, are there some goodies this time. As was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/two-classic-donkey-kong-icons-may-soon-join-bananza-as-unlockable-figures">previously rumoured</a>, the upcoming event's in-game statues are modelled on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK 64</a>'s Chunky and Lanky Kong. Finally, we can decorate DK Island with a small slice of the iconic duo... albeit only as inanimate objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4zoqhtx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>You'll find the precise times that the event gets underway in your region below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Much like the last Emerald Rush challenge, 'So Strong It's Funny' adds a tactical twist to the game mode's usually randomised elements, cutting the pool of possible upgrade perks and skills down to a pre-determined list. It looks like it'll only be 'Groove' upgrades up for grabs this time, so expect to be picking up Emeralds in style.</p>
<p>And for those wondering, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e5d5c669-a123-408e-bbd1-1e8a390cbef8">Japanese Nintendo website</a> promises that there is <em>another</em> in-game event coming our way before 2025 is up. Hey, whatever it takes to beef up that DLC package a little.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last few years alone, players have been treated to gaming excellence that can be explored and completed in a single gaming session (or night, if preferred), and there's a new title to be added, but simply not ignored: <em>UMAMI</em>. While the word itself is commonly used to describe the savoriness of a dish, it's also the name given to developer Mimmox's debut release, and yes, food is most certainly involved!</p>

<p>The game's developer did not shy away from delivering us with extravagant yet mouth-watering... puzzles (and yes, you've read correctly). Puzzles that look like some popular real-world dishes. So, after a few hours of puzzle-solving and building quite the appetite, did the developer cook something delicious with <em>UMAMI</em> worthy of a five-star rating?</p>

<h2>First Puzzling Encounter For A Hungry Mind</h2>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> is the delectable debut game from developer&nbsp;Mimmox, in which it equally challenges and makes one quite hungry over its scrumptious food-centric dioramas. It doesn't overstay its welcome when it comes to solving the puzzles, which is a great thing, but it's also very streamlined in its gameplay design and mechanics, and it packs on the cozy vibes for a stress-free experience (no hair-pulling needed).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=rPGqyqzT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=HxcfLQ79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We wonder just how puzzingly difficult it can be to assemble a hamburger?&nbsp;(Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each&nbsp;diorama featured in <em>UMAMI</em>&nbsp;has a unique theme and an associated master chef credited beside their tasty masterpieces, ranging from a purrfect hamburrrger to honey-drenched waffles, to towering stacks of sushi, and a spooky apple pie. Players must position every eye-watering piece to the diorama using a reference image of the completed&nbsp;puzzle by playing around with each puzzle piece, rotating and placing them.</p>

<p>There may not be an overarching story involved, other than the bite-sized descriptions of the themed dioramas to solve and the outstanding (and creative) chefs behind their creations. Nevertheless, players can bask in a delightful yet soothing gameplay environment while puzzle-solving, with no time limits and no added pressure, but all the time to spare in a single evening or over a weekend, relaxing over some appetizing puzzles.</p>

<h2>Let Us Cook!</h2>

<p>As alluded to, <em>UMAMI</em> is a 3D puzzle experience with warm and inviting, cozy vibes that remove the gloves and restrictions for a relaxing, puzzling solving experience. The best and adequate description of this 3D cozy puzzle game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/overcooked-review-culinary-triumph" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, with mechanics akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/fez-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Fez</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-to-left-review" rel="nofollow"><em>A Little to the Left</em></a> (and borrowing the latter's cozy vibes).</p>

<p>Like many 3D puzzle games, <em>UMAMI</em> features key elements and gameplay mechanics designed for a stress-free gaming experience as players move from one deliciously enticing puzzle to the next, cooked up by the talented animal chefs for us to behold. Movement-based mechanics is one such key element, as players are free to move or change their position to assist in solving each diorama, which extends to moving each puzzle piece by playing around with them and rotating them to discover the correct orientation.</p>

<p>Granted, it will take players some time to determine its correct orientation&nbsp;after playing around and rotating each puzzle piece, before they can place the piece onto a 3D diorama structure. Luckily, we didn't go into every puzzle blind, as the developer has kindly provided us with a reference image featuring the solved diorama, including the front and back positions, to further aid players in locating those key pieces and placing them in their correct position on the diorama structure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=rqzLjhPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=yX7R_Je6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>If you need further help in solving this tasty diorama, click the puzzle piece in the top right corner for some clues or hints. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This added detail has certainly come in handy even after spending minutes staring point-blank at the puzzle pieces and the structure, especially on the levels where many pieces look all too familiar. After completing a diorama, the next one will immediately unlock, and it's pretty much "rinse and repeat" until all 15 beautifully hand-designed levels are completed.</p>

<p>A little delicious mention is that there are a few secrets to be discovered on every level, adding yet another unique touch to this cozy puzzle experience. As for what secrets exactly can be found, all we can say is that there are animal friends that appear in some levels and cards, so our lips are sealed.</p>

<h2>Is Fresh Or Rotten?</h2>

<p>There aren't many drawbacks regarding this 3D cozy puzzle game, aside from the lack of narrative and strong art, level, and gameplay design, so players and puzzle enthusiasts won't have much to complain about. However, if one were to be nitpicking, <em>UMAMI</em> is a short game overall, as players can expect to complete all the puzzles in rapid timing before dedicating extra time to find all the secrets, so one would be looking around the ballpark of four to eight hours for 100% completion.</p>

<p>Sure, there are conversations regarding gameplay length in general, but the developers prioritized delivering a complete and polished game, well-designed puzzles, and adorable yet cozy aesthetics for an experience that's well-paced without sacrificing or cutting out content or mechanics. But if the game's appetizing puzzles are too mind-boggling for one to solve, then players would be better off playing something easier or going elsewhere for a less challenging gameplay experience, but that would be too silly to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, the game's cozy aesthetics may not appeal to every player seeking their next puzzle experience, which in turn could lead to unwarranted and incorrect assumptions about the game. As such, we would counter that argument and recommend playing the demo to find out for yourselves, but this game is worth it for the engaging puzzle and level designs, cozy aesthetics, and time well spent that leaving a tip is required (because the developer certainly "cooked" with <em>UMAMI</em>)!</p>

<h2>UMAMI Review |&nbsp;Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1072.jpg?itok=7ZY2P6St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1072.jpg?itok=l387n1t4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We're just leaving this here, but this should be a clue of what else players may find in-game. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Our time with <em>UMAMI</em> may have been fleeting, but it was certainly tantalizing and utterly irresistible, largely thanks to gorgeous puzzles, ingenious gameplay design and mechanics, and inviting audio mixing and design. The developers made a stellar effort in exquisitely designing, hand-painting, and well-balancing all 15 puzzles featured, which is worth spending every minute solving them and replaying just for the cozy aesthetics alone.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the game's cozy aesthetics and environment definitely made every minute spent less stressful and, instead, made us want more puzzles, but we were understandably satisfied with what we received. Without any guardrails or time restrictions, players are left to their devices, albeit with some assistance, to move from puzzle to puzzle at their desired pace.</p>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> may demand some brainpower, plenty of logic, and perspective to solve the five-star gourmet puzzles, but it doesn't demand too much of one's time to complete them. There is no such thing as the wrong or incorrect way to solve a puzzle, but that's the beauty and joy of them, and that's quite simply... <em>UMAMI!</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-slashed-350-off-this-asus-tuf-f16-gaming-laptop-dropping-a-1300-machine-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000644446</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-tuf-f16-2025-gaming-laptop-with-rtx-5050-just-dropped-by-hundreds-lowest-price-yet-for-this-new-release.1355584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have had a <em data-start="168" data-end="176">moment</em> these past few years. The Steam Deck basically kicked the door open, and then devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally walked right in behind it. They’re convenient, sure, and there’s something very fun about flopping on the couch and playing full PC games without the weight of a whole laptop. But at the end of the day, those handhelds are still pretty focused on gaming and not a whole lot else. If you want something that can actually do all the normal “computer stuff” <em data-start="666" data-end="671">and</em> play the games you want, a good gaming laptop still just makes more sense. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/">And right now, Amazon has a solid deal running on the Asus TUF F16. It normally sits at around $1,300, but it’s marked down to $950 at the moment—a nice $350 off.</a></p>
<p>Let’s talk specs for a minute, because that’s what really makes or breaks a gaming laptop. The TUF F16 comes with a 16-inch display in a 16:10 aspect ratio, and it pushes a Full HD resolution. The refresh rate tops out at 165Hz, which is great if you play anything fast-paced or competitive, and the response time clocks in at 7ms. It also uses Adaptive-Sync, which basically helps keep your games looking smooth by cutting down on screen tearing and random stutters. The bezels are pretty slim too, so you get a surprising amount of screen without the whole machine feeling huge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Subtle Styling</h2>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">The keyboard is full-size with a number pad—which you don’t always get on laptops these days. Asus also gave the WASD keys a gold highlight, which is a small touch but a fun one if you like a little flair without going full RGB explosion.</p>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">Under the hood, this particular model is running an Intel Core i5-13450HX paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU. You get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD for storage. It’s not a monster machine that will play every AAA title at ultra settings, but for the price, it’s more than capable. Indie games will be a breeze to run, and a lot of bigger-budget titles should run just fine at medium settings without you needing to sacrifice too much.</p>


<p data-start="2777" data-end="2997">Battery life is solid, too. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, letting you go from dead to 50% in about half an hour. You also get a 100W USB-C port that can charge your phone or accessories, which is always handy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This LEGO Christmas tree has become Amazon’s best-selling toy over the past week, and it received back-to-back price cuts in seven days. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">set just dropped to $26 from its usual $44 price and marks a 40% discount and a new record low</a> for this holiday season icon. <strong>Amazon sold over 60,000 units already</strong>&nbsp;which shows how people are jumping on this early Black Friday deal before inventory disappears. The 2-in-1 building option <strong>lets you construct either one large tree or two smaller trees</strong>, which gives you flexibility for different display spaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Holiday Classic</h2>
<p>The larger tree configuration <strong>stands over 11 inches tall</strong> which makes it substantial enough to serve as a tabletop centerpiece without dominating your space. Each tree comes adorned with miniature ornaments, candles, and a yellow star on top that captures the classic Christmas tree aesthetic. The LEGO designers nailed the proportions and details that make this recognizable as a Christmas tree rather than just a generic green structure.</p>
<p>The 2-in-1 building option is what separates this from single-configuration sets that limit your creativity. You can build one tall tree at 11 inches for a dramatic display, or <strong>construct two smaller trees at 9 inches and 6 inches</strong> to spread holiday cheer across multiple rooms. Families can split the pieces and build together, creating matching trees for different spaces in the house.</p>



<p>Build quality matches what you’d expect from LEGO with tight brick connections and durable pieces that survive multiple rebuilds. The green pieces interlock firmly enough to create a solid structure that won’t fall apart when you move it around your house. The <strong>ornament details use clever brick combinations</strong> that add visual interest without requiring hundreds of tiny frustrating pieces. The<strong> color palette stays traditional with greens, reds, and touches of gold</strong> that fit any holiday decor style.</p>



<p>The timing makes this <strong>perfect for early holiday decorating or as a family activity during Thanksgiving weekend</strong>. You can build it together as a group project that gets everyone involved in holiday preparations without spending hours untangling light strings or arguing about ornament placement. The set arrives ready to build with all pieces included and no batteries or electronics required.</p>
<p>At $26 for a set that normally costs $44, you’re getting legitimate holiday decor. You’re investing in reusable decor that brings joy every year instead of disposable decorations that end up in landfills, all while paying pocket change during this record-low Black Friday pricing.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Dueling Grounds monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Gems and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dueling Grounds is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-skateboard-simulator-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> fighting game where players take part in one-on-one duels to find out who the ultimate fighter is. Players can utilise weapons such as swords and daggers, while also executing typical fighting game actions like blocks, parries, and punches. It’s essential for players to get a solid grasp of the controls, as simply button-jamming will only get them so far. Chaining combos is crucial, as it’s the best way to do the maximum amount of damage most efficiently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Like most fighting games, Dueling Grounds also boasts an ability bar, which can be filled up by landing strikes and successfully blocking or parrying the opponent’s moves. Once filled, players can launch an ultimate attack that deals massive damage, increasing their chances for victory. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to stay competitive, using redeem codes to gain an advantage is a common practice in most Roblox games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-dueling-grounds-codes-nbsp">Active Dueling Grounds Codes&nbsp;</h2>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-dueling-grounds-codes-nbsp">Expired Dueling Grounds Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Dueling Grounds, as the game released quite recently. Considering just how much popularity it has gained over the last few weeks, the developers are likely working on new codes to be released. Once new codes release, older ones tend to expire, and when that happens, the expired codes will be moved to this section. In the meantime, we urge players to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as they could expire at any moment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-dueling-grounds-codes">How To Redeem Dueling Grounds Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dueling Grounds Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming codes in Roblox Dueling Grounds is a fairly straightforward process, as it’s just a matter of navigating through the game’s menu and inputting one of the active codes listed above into the corresponding text box. For players who are new to the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Dueling Grounds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the green star icon on the left hand side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the redeem button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-dueling-grounds-codes">How To Get More Dueling Grounds Codes</h2>



<p>New Dueling Grounds codes are likely going to be released through the game’s official Discord server or through the developers’ social accounts. However, tracking both of these for new codes regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this page can come in handy. We update this page as soon as any new codes drop , so we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked for future reference.&nbsp;</p>

In a new interview, Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat explained that the Steam Machine is designed to be both a powerful and entry-level gaming device, capable of running most of the games in your Steam library at high performance levels.</p><p>"As you know, we definitely learned a lot, from 10 years ago. We learned a lot from the Steam Deck. We really feel like we have all the hardware and the software bits to make that vision a reality," Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://youtu.be/VkW3wTHT-p8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tested</a>. "It needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games; we wanted it to be a pretty simple experience. We also wanted to target more of an entry-level device. Affordability is really important, and definitely the price-point played a huge factor in what performance level we're trying to target. Another thing we looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. It gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VkW3wTHT-p8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aldehayyat's comments might not be too far off the mark. Older gaming PCs are still capable of running a wide variety of games thanks to upscaling technologies, while in the console space, many games are still released for both current and last-gen machines, like the PS4 and the Switch. Valve has also said that the Steam Machine is over six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and the official tech specs released for it do suggest that it'll be capable of comfortably playing modern PC games.</p><p>The biggest question so far about the Steam Deck isn't <em>how </em>it'll perform, but what it'll cost when it launches next year. Aldehayyat has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">Valve wants to sell Steam Machine units at a "competitive" price</a>, with analysts predicting that it could cost $400 in a best-case scenario or as much as $1,000 if Valve is aiming to break even on every sale or make a slim profit. This is the second time that Valve is launching a Steam Machine, but Valve says it's determined to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/">not repeat the mistakes of the past</a>.</p>

                <p>Retailer GameStop has announced a "Trade Anything Day," and as part of this, people can visit a store and trade anything. Well, not quite anything. There is a list of items that GameStop will not accept, including dead animals and illegal drugs.</p><p>The fine print for the December 6 event states that people can only bring in for trade items that fit into GameStop's own 20x20x20 box and that employees have discretion to reject any item.</p><p>In terms of the specific exclusions, GameStop said people cannot bring hazardous waste, weapons, dead or alive animals (taxidermy is OK, though), alcohol, tobacco, drugs (illegal or otherwise), "sexual and explicit" items, or items "resembling body parts." The full list of exclusions is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=GameStop+%22Trade+Anything+Day%22+Is+Coming+Up+Soon%2C+Doesn%27t+Accept+%28Most%29+Dead+Animals+Or+Illegal+Drugs&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-11-17+05%3A04%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-17+06%3A31%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6536265&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.gamestop.com%252Ftrade%252F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgamestop-trade-anything-day-is-coming-up-soon-doesnt-accept-most-dead-animals-or-illegal-drugs%2F1100-6536265%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on GameStop's website.</a></p><p>It is unclear how GameStop will determine trade-in values for some of the odd items people may choose to bring on the day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="d5a922d8707e4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d5a922d8707e4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It came during the night. From the darkest, most existentially tortured recesses of a Game Freak designer’s brain. Diffidently, at first, then more boldly. Finally, hips swishing, stripper heels glittering, it announced itself across the Internet in a burst of dramatics. I am speaking, of course, of Mega Starmie, the breakout Internet star of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Mega Starmie frightened us. In its first official days of life, its long, powerful legs and humanoid gait evoked images of runway models, male, female, or otherwise; however, its lack of a head seemed at odds with this, confusing anyone who had liked those legs. <em>“Am I attracted to Mega Starmie?”</em> asked certain players, before ultimately dismissing Mega Starmie as a valiant yet unfinished design. Certainly, it was not something that they had thought of sexually when alone and three drinks in, staring out the window during a rainstorm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59yqsiul&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Next came the memes. They cast Mega Starmie as an outsider, an abomination, a sentient pair of legs with no real purpose for existing. And man, those legs took a beating. Every joke seemed to zero in on this one physical trait over which Mega Starmie had no real control.</p>
<p>They compared Mega Starmie to Patrick from <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants</strong>. They claimed that Mega Starmie was a bug the programmers had forgotten to address. They suggested Mega Starmie was physically violent. No one ever stopped to think about how this made Mega Starmie feel.</p>

<p>But it’s always darkest before dawn, and Mega Starmie began to build a cult of personality. Perhaps it was the meme of Mega Starmie as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fno-one-will-ever-convince-me-mega-starmie-is-bad-v0-nrjp2t8wqxxf1.png">Patrick in sexy fishnets</a>; perhaps it was Mega Starmie’s status as an underdog, spurned by society. Perhaps it was because of Mega Starmie’s Pokédex entry, which suggested that it had become more humanoid “to supplant humanity.” To break the wheel.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Mega Starmie began to assume the role of a self-possessed rebel imbued with feminine power. A symbol of resistance. A queer icon.</p>

<p>Queer cosplayers across the Internet started <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weeeelson/video/7568166463383571725">dressing as Mega Starmie</a>, both for Halloween and just to terrorise their conservative relatives. Awarding her the pronouns of she/her, they recast her as the protagonist of a new, celebratory strain of memes, positioning her as a SheEO and arbiter of taste. She appeared in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gay_irl/comments/1okhu8j/gayirl/"><strong>Devil Wears Prada</strong> memes</a>, <strong>Bridesmaids</strong> memes, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/3152153-mega-starmie">Jean Claude Van Damme memes</a>. Drag queens learned how to paint like Mega Starmie and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP9-eQFEktz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">constructed entire garments</a> to evoke her potent, otherworldly glamour.</p>
<p>Finally, Mega Starmie had a purpose in life: to slay.</p>

<p>Regular Starmie has already been memed before, of course. Once the Internet caught on to its vaguely sexual cries in French dubs of the original Pokémon series, people had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dOzdKjux6vI">field day.</a> But even French Starmie’s sex positivity and certified freak status weren’t enough to make it into a queer icon.</p>
<p>This time around, things are different. Mega Starmie is a former reject of society, excluded for her very nature. She didn’t choose to have long, muscular legs. She was born this way.</p>
<p>It also helps that Regular Starmie was already a queer icon of sorts before Legends: Z-A came out. Thanks to its officially genderless status according to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/starmie">the National Pokédex</a> and its purple-and-yellow colouring, which evokes the non-binary flag, Regular Starmie <a href="https://adobe-outdesign.tumblr.com/post/686157350094192640/starmie-has-been-referred-to-as-a-non-binary">has already been</a> a non-binary icon for many.</p>

<p>In fact, its former status has inspired passionate questions about how Mega Starmie should identify now in terms of its pronouns. Is Mega Starmie she/her? Or is Mega Starmie they/them? Perhaps she/they are comfortable with both labels and will accept either.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that Mega Starmie is nothing if not passionate about making her gender identity non-controversial. For this reason, I believe that she’s a she/they who uses any <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/guilhernunes.bsky.social/post/3m3dnvqn3q22z">discussion surrounding her labels</a> as an opportunity to educate her friends and provoke her haters, in a non-pedantic way.</p>
<p>And just like non-binary and trans people these days, Mega Starmie has often been misunderstood and even feared by the general populace. I mean, it’s not like she’s turning children gay by breathing on them, or Hydro Pump-ing every man she sees; a lot of the time, she’s just trying to teleport up to her trainer as he completes yet another scaffolding obstacle course. And we’re going to snicker behind her back? Wow.</p>
<figure data-uuid="51a923bceb5a4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51a923bceb5a4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whatever people say about her, Mega Starmie is thriving these days. And she may even have a love interest soon. Word on the street is that Mega Malamar has also been claimed as a queer icon, one that’s even more out and proud than Mega Starmie. In one meme, Mega Malamar can be seen using his psychic powers to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DObbGIYCK3-/?hl=en">spread gay rights around the world</a>. Honestly, he sounds like a perfect match for Meg. They can attend rallies together.</p>
<p>Also, the world needs another ludicrous fictional couple to root for now that Pennywise and the Babadook have parted ways. At least, I assume they have. I used to check every year but I haven’t in a while. Maybe that’s because my mental health has improved.</p>
<p>And maybe <em>that’s</em> because I know that there’s a Mega Starmie out there somewhere, watching over the queers, singing <strong>God Help the Outcasts</strong> as she struts down Centrico Plaza, Mega Kick-ing anyone who doesn’t have a Pride flag on their porch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no mystery that Valve's Steam platform continues to grow at a steady rate. Over the past few years, we've reported several new concurrent peak player records, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recorded a month ago with around 41.6 million users</a> online at the same time.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this also translates into higher sales on the store. <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/valves-bold-expected-return-to-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics</a>, Steam has already generated sales for around $16.2 billion in 2025, a 5.7% increase over 2024's estimated $15.33 billion. Do note that 2024's data point is, of course, final, whereas there are still 44 days left in 2025, and it's arguably the period when people spend more due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday sales, Holiday gifts, and so on. It would not be a surprise to see Steam break the $17 billion threshold by year's end.</p>



<p>Valve takes a substantial cut out of each sale conducted on the store: 30% until the product reaches $10 million in revenue, 25% between $10 million and $50 million, and 20% over $50 million. It's one of the ways the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-store-fee-lowered-from-30-to-12-for-pc-games-halo-infinite-will-have-crossplay-and-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later the Microsoft Store</a> have attempted to compete with Valve's store (which many game developers still consider a monopoly) by offering a higher revenue per sale than they can get on Steam. On those stores, developers only pay a 12% fee and get 88% of the sale.</p>



<p>Epic also famously paid hefty sums to secure big temporary game exclusives, such as Borderlands 3, on its store. At one point, Epic founder Tim Sweeney even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-tim-sweeney-promises-forego-exclusive-deals-if/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenged Valve to match the Epic Games Store's revenue split</a>, stating that he would have ended the exclusivity program if they agreed to do so.</p>



<p>Valve never flinched, though, thanks to the unwavering loyalty of hundreds of millions of gamers. While Epic did manage to carve for itself a sizable platform on the EGS, between exclusive, free games, and the evergreen Fortnite, Steam did not suffer in the least and, as shown by these figures, keeps growing.</p>



<p>Alinea Analytics estimates that Valve has already earned $4 billion in 2025 from the sales on its store. With these numbers, it's perhaps no wonder that its president, co-founder, and majority stakeholder, Gabe Newell, has a lot of money to spare.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, website Boat International <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/oceanco-y722-superyacht-leviathan-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Newell has just received his latest superyacht, a 111-meter entirely custom wonder called Leviathan. Produced by Oceanco (which was also acquired by the Valve owner earlier this year), it can accommodate up to 22 guests plus 33 crew members. It features two gyms, a spa, a bar, a basketball half-court, a beach club, a small hospital, and, of course, an entertainment room equipped with fifteen top-of-the-line gaming PCs.</p>



<p>With Steam poised to expand its ecosystem even further <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the launches of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller products early next year</a>, Valve's billionaire owner, who recently said he lives full-time at sea but still works remotely on various company projects, will probably be able to afford more of these superyachts in the near future.</p>

            <p>November digs in. The conveyor belt of crowns, clowns and clones that is Videogaming rattles onward through the midnight forest. The rains swept past over the weekend and now the mud is waist-deep, worryingly responsive, and rank with the stench of neglected deckbuilders. Several sedan chairs carrying former BioWare creative leads are caught in a wave of slop, becoming a disorderly barricade of people crying out for Femshep to come save them from the GAAS. Tencent executives rush over with handfuls of rope, but whether they mean to drag the afflicted free or bind their limbs is unclear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Answering the call of nature, you wade away from the tumult of shovels and torches. As you pass behind a trunk, you are caught in the spell of metsänpeitto, and are suddenly alone. There is no sound, neither the shriek of mired horses nor the clinking of coins in the CEO carriages. The trunks lean towards the glow of your lantern. Then you hear a crackle. Twitching radiance guides you through a gap to a clearing, where five hooded arcanists circle a ritual pyre. Each is named for a weekday, and each has a bagful of new PC games they now thrust upon you. Which will you choose? Do not refuse them all: the flames can always take another body.

<p>The choice is made. Your sight thickens abruptly, the fire falling still. The hooded figures swell and pustulate and you realise that you are looking at a circle of mushrooms, while lying flat on a boulder of moss.</p>
<p>You rise to your feet groggily. Behind you, the great procession of Videogaming continues. Somebody has resolved the sedan chair situation by rolling the ex-BioWare contingent into an enormous, squelching katamari. A few bats swoop past as you resume your place in the convoy. Keep trudging onward. Surely this forest has an outside. Some day, December will come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-joy-con-controllers-l-r-are-going-for-peanuts-as-a-special-early-black-friday-deal.1355542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the main ways to play on the Nintendo Switch is with the Joy-Con controllers. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your existing ones or just want to gift a fresh set to a gamer in your life this holiday season, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Right now, the Nintendo Joy-Con (L/R) are down to $79 on Amazon, which is 12% off their usual $90 price tag.</a> Joy-Cons rarely see major discounts, which makes this one a great option to grab a new pair without paying the full price. There are other color options available, too, though the discount may vary depending on the one you choose. The Neon Red and Blue combo is a classic, though, and it makes the most sense to grab it while it’s the most heavily discounted. We just highly recommend acting fast to snag it up, as the deal is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Play</h2>
<p>These Bluetooth controllers can be used in multiple ways. You can use them independently in each hand, attach them to a Joy-Con grip for a single controller-style unit, or snap them onto the Switch for handheld gaming. Each of these has a full set of buttons, so using one as a standalone mini-controller won’t feel limiting at all. In fact, it’s going to come in handy for some two-player sessions in games!</p>
<p>There’s an accelerometer paired with a gyro-sensor for accurate, two-dimensional movement tracking. These make it possible to pull off motion-based gameplay without requiring any additional accessories.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 20 hours of continuous use on a full charge, which is more than enough to support at least a couple days of gaming. They recharge quickly too and are back to full in about 3.5 hours, so you can get back to the action without much downtime. Recharging can be done by attaching them to the Nintendo Switch console while it’s docked or plugged in. You can also insert them in the Joy-Con Charging Grip which is sold separately, or go for third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Again, it’s best to grab the offer sooner rather than later. We’re not expecting Amazon to keep this deal live for too long, especially with holiday shopping ramping up.</a> Once the discount disappears, you’ll have to pay the full $90 price or worse, deal with shipping delays.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It has been confirmed that at least five games will leave Xbox Game Pass this November.</p>



<p>Found by XBOriginals on <a href="https://x.com/xboriginals/status/1990405120140472791?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the following games have been confirmed to leave Xbox Game Pass on November 30, 2025.</p>

<p>It’s currently unknown if the list of games will be the final total, but generally speaking, Xbox removes around five to ten games per month, so don’t forget to claim them now before they leave the subscription server!</p>

			<p>Everstone Studio's Where Winds Meet does a lot of things right, but its AI chatbot NPCs are unironically one of its best features, leading to all sorts of hilarious interactions that players are fully embracing.</p>



<p>Many of the game's NPCs, with which players can build lasting relationships as part of the game's core mechanics, are actually powered by AI chatbots that reply to all sorts of inputs from the player. During the early access review period of the global version, I wasn't able to make them do anything other than repeat some set lines, but now that the game is finally live, these NPCs are fully functional, and players have been testing how much they can be pushed to provide some genuinely fun interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-most-vicious-ai-break-up-child-support-and-grief">The Most Vicious AI Break-Up: Child Support and Grief</h3>



<p>One user on the game's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/">official subreddit</a>, MisterZan25, proved to be particularly cruel, subjecting the Zhao Dali NPC to a vicious narrative arc. The player made the NPC believe their character was pregnant with their child, demanded child support, and eventually informed them that the child had died.</p>



<p>The AI NPC believed the entire scenario and reacted dramatically to the news, <strong>providing a moment of dark comedy.</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<figure></figure>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-life-advice-and-martial-arts-moves">Life Advice and Martial Arts Moves</h3>



<p>Not all interactions have to be so destructive in Where Winds Meet. Some kind-hearted players have tried to lift the spirits of some AI NPCs, often resulting in reactions that fit the Wuxia setting.</p>



<p>User lessobvious had a <strong>constructive exchange</strong> with an NPC, successfully lifting their spirits by highlighting the value of training, even after that training had failed to help the NPC find a wife.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User zheiro provided life advice to an AI NPC, who <strong>appreciated the guidance and thanked the user gracefully</strong> in a manner that felt perfectly in line with the game’s aesthetic.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User OtherwiseEnd944, on the other hand, decided to have a little bit of fun with another NPC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1oxmtez/the_ai_is_killing_me/">suggesting a rather "peculiar" martial arts move</a>, which<strong> left the NPC baffled</strong>, proving the system reacts even to the most absurd of interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-taunt-npcs-and-pay-the-price">Taunt NPCs and Pay the Price</h3>



<p>The AI’s reactivity extends beyond mere conversation. Treating the NPCs rudely can lead to believable, and sometimes violent, reactions. User Sensitive_Touch_8190 taunted an AI NPC repeatedly, and after having had enough, <strong>the character retaliated</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if this sort of bizarre, player-driven feature isn't your alley, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Where Winds Meet</strong> has a lot to offer for all sorts of players.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi%E2%80%99s-380-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-is-one-of-2025%E2%80%99s-best-deals-so-far.1355518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At $380, MSI’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor is one of the best purchases <em>Verge </em>readers who want an awesome gaming upgrade can make now. That’s how much it costs in an online-only deal at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/p/-/msi-265-wqhd-qd-oled-240hz-amd-freesync-premium-pro-gaming-monitor/4000411993?langId=-1" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> for <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html" rel="sponsored">membership holders</a> through December 1st. In case you’re curious as to what kind of OLED monitor you can get for just $380, so was I. So I got MSI to send over a review unit, which I’ve been using for over a week.</p><p>This monitor (model MAG271QPX E2) doesn’t really differ from several other similarly-sized models. It offers a fast 240Hz refresh rate, fantastic viewing angles compared to cheaper panel types, and colors that really pop. It’s not typically one I’d suggest most people buy at its usual <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-QD-OLED-27-inch-Response-Adjustable/dp/B0D68C1BVS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$599</a> sale price, but it becomes an extremely compelling value for $200 less.</p><p>MSI’s QD-OLED replaced an aging Acer 1440p IPS 144Hz monitor at my desk, and the difference was profound when I jumped into a game. I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> lately, and the landscapes look more lived-in than they do with the limited, pale color gamut that my IPS can muster. The chaotic action looks a little more real, thanks to more vivid-looking explosions. Every little aspect of the interface is easier to parse, too, thanks to OLEDs unbeatable contrast ratio.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’m happy with how this monitor looks, especially for this doorbuster price.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> is another title I recently picked up that looks particularly stunning on this display. I wish I had started testing this around Halloween, when I was playing more scary games, because its deep black levels look fantastic in my home office — it’s got great contrast. If this is your first OLED gaming monitor and you haven’t yet experienced the difference between that and an inferior panel type, you’re in for a treat that keeps on giving.</p><p>I play a lot of games, but I type articles in Google Docs more often because of my job. OLEDs have a bad reputation for rendering text; various subpixel layout types introduce color-tinged aliasing that’s not present on IPS and other types of non-OLED panels. The evidence of this is irrefutable under close inspection, as this <a href="https://youtu.be/lrdllziZe5w?si=isDLVHCijYqUKk2a&amp;t=159">Monitors Unboxed hands-on video</a> proves. However, as the video mentions, you may not notice it. From the distance I sit from the monitor, it looks fine to me.</p><p>This monitor’s specs make it a particularly good deal compared to other non-OLED monitors at this price point. This model supports variable refresh rate between the range of 48Hz and 240Hz. While it only lists support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync, not Nvidia G-Sync, I’ve been happy with its performance in a range of games while connected to my Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti-powered PC. The panel itself is covered in an “anti-reflection” coating that appears semi-glossy, so it might catch reflections in a well-lit room. This monitor comes with a nice height-adjustable stand that allows for tilting, swiveling, and pivoting, but I just tossed it on my monitor arm thanks to its VESA mount.</p><p>MSI covers the monitor with a three-year warranty that includes panel burn-in, which is great. I’m also smitten with this model’s ports. It sports one DisplayPort 1.4a port, two HDMI 2.1 ports supporting up to 240Hz on PC (or up to 120Hz on consoles), plus one USB-C with DisplayPort video, which works great with my Steam Deck, and a headphone jack. That port allows 15W PD charging, but is turned off by default.</p><p>If there’s one complaint that I have, it’s that the plastic chassis on the back is a bit chunky compared to other models that I’ve tested. However, MSI says that this is where the monitor’s heatsink is located, which allows it to have a fanless design. And at $380, this complaint doesn’t hold much water.</p><p>If you aren’t a Costco member, it may be worth it to become one if only just for this deal. But if you don’t plan to become one, it’s possible that we’ll see deals at other retailers for this model. It sold for $449.99 at Amazon during the Prime Big Deal Days, so hopefully that price (or ideally, something better) will pop up during Black Friday.</p><p>While Best Buy only sells the MSI monitor through a third-party seller, the retailer currently has <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Falienware-aw2725d-27-qd-oled-qhd-280hz-0-03-ms-freesync-and-g-sync-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-hdmi-displayport-black%2FJ3K4L6RFPL%2Fsku%2F6640502" rel="sponsored">Alienware’s AW2725D</a>, the company’s 27-inch 280Hz 1440p QD-OLED, for $499.99 — a $50 price drop. LG’s 27-inch 1440p OLED with 240Hz refresh rate (which seems very similar to MSI’s) is $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF786923/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. In other words, there are deals to be had just about anywhere. But right now, Costco’s is the one to beat on a QD-OLED gaming monitor.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ahead-of-black-friday-amazon-has-its-fire-tv-stick-hd-on-sale-for-half-price-2000644443</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-practically-giving-away-the-new-fire-tv-stick-hd-in-a-pre%E2%80%93black-friday-price-meltdown.1355515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back when the Amazon Fire TV Stick first showed up, the whole pitch was basically, “Hey, plug this in and boom—your old TV is suddenly smart.” Fast-forward to now, and most TVs fresh off the shelf already have some kind of smart interface built in. The thing is, a lot of those built-in interfaces… kind of suck. Some companies still haven’t cracked the code on making a simple, smooth UI. (Looking at you, LG, with your strange Wiimote-wannabe remotes). So at this point, the real draw of the Fire TV Stick isn’t that it makes your TV “smart”—it’s that it gives you a <em data-start="722" data-end="730">better</em> smart experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">And right now, the newest Fire TV Stick HD is down to just $18.</a> Normally it runs $35, but this deal chops nearly half off the price, which is pretty hard to complain about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Once you plug it in, you can basically stream anything you’d expect: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this month), Disney+, Prime Video—the usual cast.. As long as you’ve got the subscriptions, the content is there. But even if you don’t want to spend any more on streaming subs, the Fire TV Stick actually has quite a bit of free stuff built in. Apps like Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, and a ton of Fire TV’s own free channels give you a surprising amount of movies and TV show episodes to just kick back and watch. Sure, they’re ad-supported, but free is free.</p>
<p data-start="1513" data-end="1986">One of the nicest quality-of-life things is the Alexa remote. No one enjoys hunting and pecking their way through an on-screen keyboard with a clunky d-pad. With the Alexa button, you literally just say what you want—“play <em data-start="1736" data-end="1742">Dune</em>” or “find <em data-start="1753" data-end="1770">The Mandalorian</em>”—and it pulls it up for you. It even scans across multiple apps to tell you which service actually has the thing you’re searching for, which saves you from the endless “which app did I watch that on?” guessing game.</p>


<h2 data-start="1513" data-end="1986">Cloud-based Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="1988" data-end="2503">Another neat perk that’s becoming more and more practical: you can actually play cloud-streamed Xbox games through it. If you’ve got Game Pass Ultimate, you don’t need an Xbox console at all—the cloud streaming service lets you play straight on your Fire Stick as long as your internet isn’t terrible. It’s kind of wild being able to fire up games like <em data-start="2321" data-end="2334">Animal Well</em> or <em data-start="2338" data-end="2374">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on something only marginally larger than pack of gum. As long as your Wi-Fi is steady, the whole experience is way smoother than you’d expect. And now with&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>coming to a number of services including Netflix, now’s a great time to experiment with cloud gaming.</p>

<p>Valve’s second big foray into first-party PC hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-says-its-still-waiting-for-better-chips-to-power-steam-deck-2/">isn’t</a> a sequel to the much-imitated Steam Deck portable, but rather <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">a desktop computer</a> called the Steam Machine. And while it could go on your desk, Valve clearly intends for it to fit in an entertainment center under a TV—next to, or perhaps even instead of, a game console like the Xbox or PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this idea could work, and it’s because I’ve already been experimenting with what is essentially a “Steam Machine” underneath my own TV for months, starting in May when Valve began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">making it possible to install SteamOS on certain kinds of generic PC hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on what it costs—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">and we can only guess what it will cost</a>—the Steam Machine could be a good fit for people who just want to plug a more powerful version of the Steam Deck experience into their TVs. But for people who like tinkering or who, like me, have been messing with miniature TV-connecting gaming PCs for years and are simply tired of trying to make Windows workable, the future promised by the Steam Machine is already here.</p>
<h2>My TV PC setup</h2>
<p>I had always been sort of TV PC-curious, but I can trace my current setup to December 2018, when, according to a Micro Center receipt in my inbox, I built a $504.51 PC in a tiny InWin Chopin case centered on an <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/ryzen-5-2400g.c1976">AMD Ryzen 5 2400G processor</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, the Ryzen brand was only a couple of years old, and the 2400G <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-2400g-zen-vega-cpu-gpu,5467-11.html">had impressed reviewers</a> by combining a competent-enough quad-core CPU with a usably performant integrated GPU. And the good news was: It worked! It was nowhere near as good as the graphical experience that, say, a PlayStation 4 could provide, but it worked well for older and indie games, while also giving me access to a TV-connected computer for the occasions when I wanted to stream things from a browser, or participate in a living room-scale Zoom call (something that would become the box’s main job during the pandemic-induced isolation of 2020 and early 2021).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>(This PC evolved over time and currently uses a Ryzen 8700G processor, which includes AMD’s best CPU and integrated GPU for socketed desktop motherboards. I did this to get more stable 1080p performance in more games, but I would not recommend this build to most people right now—more on that in a bit.)</p>
<p>The main problem was Windows, which was not and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/">still is not</a> particularly well-optimized for controller-driven living room use. What I really wanted was a startup process that felt more or less like a game console: hit the power button, and automatically get launched into a gamepad-navigable interface that would let me launch and play things without touching a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>There are third-party apps like <a href="https://www.launchbox-app.com/">Launchbox</a> that make a go of providing this functionality for people more interested in emulation or who own games from multiple PC storefronts. What I eventually settled on was <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/838506/how-to-sign-into-your-windows-11-pc-automatically/">a sort of hacky fix</a> that allowed my user account to log in automatically, and then automatically launch Steam in <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3725-76D3-3F31-FB63">Big Picture Mode</a>.</p>
<p>This worked… fine—except when I needed to interact with a mouse and keyboard to install driver updates, or when some component of the Windows UI would steal focus from the Big Picture Mode window and make it impossible to use the controller to navigate.</p>
<p>So when reports indicated that Valve was working on a SteamOS version that would run on more hardware, I was immediately interested. SteamOS was designed to boot right into its gaming interface, and the desktop mode was its own separate thing that you needed to open up manually—ideal for my usage model, since I didn’t want to <em>give up</em> the desktop mode but also didn’t need to use it often. But I did run into some bumps during the installation process, which I’ll share here in case it helps you avoid them.</p>

<p>I had trouble using Valve’s official restore image (SteamOS version 3.7.7, from <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1b71-edf2-eb6d-2bb3#reimage">this support page</a>) to get newer hardware working, which may be one reason why that language was softened. It was no problem to install official first-party SteamOS on slightly older hardware, like the Ryzen 7040 version of the Framework Laptop 13 or an older Acer laptop with a Ryzen 6000-series processor installed. But trying to install the software on newer hardware failed no matter what I tried. Those systems included the Ryzen AI 300 version of the Framework Laptop; a socket AM5 testbed desktop with a dedicated Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU; and, to my great disappointment, my TV desktop’s Ryzen 7 8700G.</p>
<p>There’s very little information out there about installing or troubleshooting SteamOS on generic hardware, but if you poke around on Reddit about much of anything, you’ll quickly meet a specific Type of Guy who believes that anyone with hardware compatibility issues should just use <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a>, a community-developed alternate operating system that attempts to provide a SteamOS-ish alternative with wider hardware support (including for Intel and Nvidia hardware, which isn’t likely to be supported by the official SteamOS any time soon).</p>
<p>And so Bazzite I tried! Indicating that I used an AMD GPU and wanted to boot into the SteamOS interface offered me the exact same image that Bazzite offers for the Steam Deck and other handhelds, and it installed on my Ryzen desktop with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>Bazzite also came&nbsp;<em>painfully</em> close to what I wanted it to be, in terms of user experience—a desktop mode to boot into on the occasions I needed one, but otherwise I could just fire up the Xbox controller I had paired to the PC and jump right into a game.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But Bazzite was sunk by the same kind of bugs and edge cases that often chase me away from Linux operating systems when I try them. The main issue was that periodically, the system would boot up into desktop mode without asking (usually this seemed to happen when the Steam client software needed an update, but I can’t say for sure). Restarting the system would usually boot it back into the SteamOS interface—but I’d need to log in all over again, <em>and</em> the OS would switch Bluetooth off by default. Not only am I having to dig out a keyboard and mouse to solve this problem, but I’m needing to use a&nbsp;<em>wired</em> keyboard until I could get Bluetooth turned back on.</p>
<p>By the time this had happened twice, I was sure it wasn’t a fluke; by the time it had happened four or five times, I was determined to blow the entire operating system away and try again. And I was particularly interested in trying actual, for-real SteamOS again, just in case a new Bazzite install would have the same problems as the one I was already using.</p>
<p>After some digging, I found <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/">this directory</a>. If you look through those folders, you’ll see OS images for various versions of SteamOS, including newer versions of SteamOS 3.7 (the “stable” version you’ll find on the Deck) and builds of both SteamOS 3.8 and 3.9 (the Deck will pull these down if you switch from the “stable” OS channel to “main”). Not all of those folders include the repair image you need to wipe a device and install SteamOS, but a few do—<a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20251027.1000/">this one</a>, dated October 27, is the most recent as of this writing.</p>
<p>Those newer versions of the operating system include changes that expand SteamOS’s hardware support, most notably a step up from Linux kernel version 6.11 to version 6.16. And it was that <code>steamdeck-repair-main-20251027.1000-3.8.0.img.zip</code> file that I was finally able to <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">flash to a USB drive</a> and install on my TV desktop <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227">using Valve’s instructions</a>.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>It has only been a week or so since then, but at least so far I’m finally getting what I wanted: the same experience as on my Deck, just on my TV, with hardware that is somewhat better-suited for a larger and higher-resolution screen (and that’s the main reason to do this, rather than use a docked Steam Deck for everything).</p>

<p>Once the OS is installed and is up and running, anyone who has used a Steam Deck will find it instantly familiar, and all you’ll need to do to get going is connect or pair a gamepad and/or a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Most of the bugs and quirks I’ve run into stem from the fact that this software was developed for standalone handheld gaming consoles first and foremost. There are multiple settings toggles—including those for adaptive brightness and HDMI-CEC—that serve a purpose on the Steam Deck but just don’t function on a desktop, where these features usually aren’t present or aren’t supported.</p>
<p>SteamOS is also pretty hit or miss about selecting the correct resolution and refresh rate for a connected display. Navigate to the Settings, to Display, and then turn off the “Automatically Set Resolution” toggle, and you’ll see a full list of supported resolutions and refresh rates that you can pick from. You may also want to scroll down and change the “Maximum Game Resolution” from “Native” to the actual native resolution of your screen, since I occasionally encountered games that wouldn’t offer resolutions that were supported by the display I was using.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may need to navigate to the Audio settings and switch output devices if you’re sending audio over HDMI. I also needed to turn the audio output volume up to around 80 percent before the sound coming out of my Steam Machine would match the volume of all the other boxes connected to my TV.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And if you’ve never used SteamOS before, it’s worth reading up on some of its limitations. While its compatibility with Windows games is quite good, Valve’s Proton compatibility layer is in continuous development, and not every game will play perfectly or play at all. Games that use anti-cheat software are <a href="https://areweanticheatyet.com/">still broadly incompatible with SteamOS</a>, since many anti-cheat programs hook into the Windows kernel in ways that are impossible to translate or emulate. And while it’s possible to run games from other storefronts like Epic or GOG, it’s best done with third-party software like the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, adding an extra layer of complexity.</p>
<p>And although SteamOS includes a useful desktop mode, it’s really not meant to be used as a day-to-day workhorse operating system—security features like “using a password to log in” are off by default in the interest of expediency, and you need to open your system to bootloader tampering just to install it. It’s fine for installing and running the odd desktop app every once in a while, but I’d hesitate to trust it with anything sensitive.</p>
<p>Finally, while our tests have shown that SteamOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">generally performs at least as well, if not better, than Windows</a> running on the same hardware, the first-party version of SteamOS is still made with handhelds and other low-power hardware in mind. In my limited testing of SteamOS on desktops with both integrated and with more powerful dedicated GPUs, I’ve generally found that those observations hold up. But I’ve only tested on a narrow range of hardware, and you could easily encounter a setup where SteamOS just doesn’t run games as well as Windows does.</p>

<p>Say you’re interested in having a Steam Machine, you don’t want to wait for Valve, and you don’t just happen to have a spare ideally configured AMD-based PC to sacrifice to the testing gods.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>I am more or less happy with my custom-built mini ITX Steam Machine, but I find it difficult to recommend this hardware combination to basically anybody at this point. For me, it scratched a PC-building itch, and the potential for future upgradability is mildly interesting to me. But given the high cost of AMD’s Socket AM5 platform and spiking costs for RAM and SSDs, it’s going to be difficult to put together an 8700G-focused system in an InWin Chopin for less than $800. And that’s a whole lot to pay for a years-old Radeon 780M GPU.</p>
<p>For a more budget-friendly Steam Machine, consider the range of no-name mini PCs available on Amazon and some other places. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/what-i-learned-when-i-replaced-my-cheap-pi-5-pc-with-a-no-name-amazon-mini-desktop/">We’ve dabbled with systems</a> from manufacturers like Aoostar, Beelink, Bosgame, and GMKtec before and come away conditionally impressed by the ratio of utility-to-performance, and YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLl0WU8Gkzk">RetroGameCorps</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N88lXCTMNqE">ETA Prime</a> periodically cover new ones and generally have positive things to say. You’re rolling the dice on long-term reliability and support, but it’s also tough to argue with the convenience of the form factor or the pricing compared to a custom-built system.</p>
<p>If you’re going this route, we have some general recommendations and performance numbers, based on testing of similar chips in other laptops and desktops. Note that the Ryzen 6800U/Radeon 680M system is an Acer Swift Edge 16 laptop with 16GB of soldered DDR5, while the Ryzen 7840U/Radeon 780M system is a Framework Laptop 13 with non-soldered DDR5. Performance may differ a few FPS in either direction depending on your hardware configuration. The Ryzen 7700X/Radeon RX 7600 system is a custom-built testbed desktop similar to the one we use for testing CPUs and GPUs; based on hardware alone, we’d expect the real Steam Machine to perform near or slightly below .</p>

<p>In the $350 to $400 range, look for PCs with a Ryzen 6800-series chip in them, like the 6800H or 6850H (here’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQKRXKS5">one from GMKTec for $385</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F62L51RJ">one from Beelink for $379</a>). These processors come with a Radeon 680M integrated GPU, with 12 compute units (CUs) based on the RDNA2 architecture. These boxes will offer performance slightly superior to the actual Steam Deck, which uses eight RDNA2 CUs and squeezes them into a system with a small power envelope.</p>
<p>If you can spend around $500, that generally seems to get you the best performance for the price right now. Look for processors in the Ryzen 7040 or 8040 series, or the Ryzen 250 series (here’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ4WBV8L">one for $$490 from GMKtec</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZBSPBN9">one for $499 from Bosgame</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FSKYK2MQ">one for $449 from Aoostar</a>). These chips all offer broadly similar combinations of eight Zen 4-based CPU cores, and a 12-core Radeon 780M GPU based on the RDNA3 architecture.</p>
<p>In a mini desktop, this GPU can come pretty close to doubling the performance of the Steam Deck, though it will still fall short of most dedicated graphics cards. It’s similar to the performance level of <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2.html">the non-Extreme version of the Ryzen Z2 chip</a> for competing handhelds. The 780M is also the same GPU that comes with the Ryzen 8700G desktop chip I use, and I’ve found that it gets you decent 1080p performance in many games.</p>
<p>The GPU is the most important thing to focus on in these systems, since it’s going to have the most impact on the way games actually run. But keep an eye on RAM and storage, too; a 1TB SSD is obviously preferable to a 500GB SSD. And while most of these come with a healthy 32GB of RAM by default, pay attention to the <em>type</em> of RAM. If it just says “DDR5,” that’s most likely to be socketed RAM that’s a bit slower, but which you can upgrade yourself if you want. If it comes with LPDDR5X, that’s going to be soldered down, but also a bit faster, maximizing your graphics performance.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Steam Deck is a useful benchmark here, because it’s a fixed hardware platform that’s popular enough that PC game developers sometimes go out of their way to target. Games often include Steam Deck-specific graphics presets, which are a useful starting point when you’re fiddling with settings.</p>
<p>I would generally try to avoid systems with Ryzen AI 300-series chips in them—their Radeon 890M GPUs are faster, but they can also be twice as expensive as the Radeon 780M boxes. I’d also stay away from anything with Ryzen 5000 or 3000-series chips, or Ryzen 7030-series chips. The price tags on these $200 to $300 systems are tempting, and they <em>will</em> probably run SteamOS, but their older Vega-based GPUs will fall far short of the Steam Deck’s GPU, let alone the Radeon 680M or 780M.</p>

<p>OK, but what if you have more money to spend, and you’re more interested in 1440p or 4K gaming performance (roughly what Valve is targeting with the actual Steam Machine)? I think that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">the Framework Desktop</a> is a surprisingly good fit here; <a href="https://frame.work/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300/configuration/new">$1,200</a> will get you a console-sized PC with an eight-core Zen 5 CPU, a Radeon 8050S GPU with 32 CUs based on the RDNA 3.5 architecture (the Steam Machine has 28 RDNA3 CUs), 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.&nbsp; I can confirm firsthand that SteamOS 3.8/3.9 installs and runs just fine.</p>
<p>This desktop is <em>probably</em> a bit more expensive than the Steam Machine will end up being, but it’s impossible to say how much more expensive before Valve actually puts out a price.</p>
<h2>The TV PC is ready for its close-up</h2>
<p>TV-connected PCs have historically been a niche thing. They’re expensive, they’re finicky, and purpose-built game consoles have always provided a more pleasant and seamless experience for people who just want to do everything with a controller from the couch.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But the TV PC could finally be ready for its moment. In SteamOS, Valve has created a pretty good, pretty widely compatible Windows substitute that buries a lot of the PC’s complexity (without totally removing it, for the people who want it sometimes). Like the Nintendo Switch, Valve has crafted a user interface that feels good to use on a handheld screen and on a TV from 10 feet away.</p>
<p>And this is happening at the same time as a weird detente in the console wars, where Sony seems to be embracing PC ports and easing up on exclusive releases at the same time as Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">seems</a>, for all intents and purposes, to be winding down the Xbox hardware operation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">in favor of Windows</a>. Valve is way out in front of Microsoft on its console-style PC interface at the same time as the PC is becoming a sort of universally compatible über-console.</p>
<p>I’m kind of the ideal audience for the Steam Machine; nearly all my PC games are on Steam, I play practically nothing that requires anti-cheat software, and I play mostly graphically undemanding indie games rather than GPU-bruising AAA titles. So, you know, take my enthusiasm for the concept with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But as someone who has already functionally been living with a Steam Machine for months, I think that Valve’s new hardware could do for living room PCs what the Steam Deck has done for handhelds: defining and expanding a product category that others have tried and failed to crack. This year, my Steam Machine has ably kept up with me as I’ve played&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/"><em>Silksong</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/ufo-50-is-the-best-retro-gaming-homage-ive-ever-played/"><em>UFO 50</em></a>, <em>Dave the Diver</em>, both HD-2D <em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>remakes, part of a bad-guy run through&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>, some multiplayer <em>Vampire Survivors </em>experimentation, several <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> sessions, and more besides. I’ve never been less tempted to buy a PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Capcom is working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC, following a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>The company has been heavily criticised for the performance of Monster Hunter Wilds, though it's acknowledged those issues. A <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1988371442619003050?s=20">free update is due on 16th December</a>, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-players-wait-almost-a-year-for-better-performance-capcom-is-in-danger-of-losing-its-most-important-audience">players have been waiting the majority of the year for</a>.</p>
<p>It seems Capcom has learned its lesson, though, and will ensure Resident Evil Requiem won't suffer a similar fate.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features," said Capcom during a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">Q&amp;A for its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>"At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, the ninth mainline game in the series, launches next year on 27th February. Not only will it be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">coming to Switch 2 too</a> along with Resident Evil Biohazard and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> on the same day.</p>
<p>As such, Capcom has an extra platform on its hands to optimise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-producer-explains-why-capcom-scrapped-multiplayer-horror-we-cant-just-slap-on-new-skins-and-characters">Resident Evil Requiem actually started life as an online multiplayer open-world game</a>, it was recently reported, and it retains "some" elements of that concept.</p>
<p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," said producer Masato Kumazawa. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they [...] probably wouldn't enjoy it as much."</p>
