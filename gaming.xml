            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ah yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/freedom-wars">Freedom Wars</a>, the seemingly last bastion of the PlayStation Vita, is finally <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-announced-vita-steam-switch-ps5-ps4">moving onwards from Sony’s retired handheld</a>. With the help of Bandai Namco, developer Dimps (partially made up of members from the original Freedom Wars development team) is bringing the Monster Hunter-style action-RPG to modern platforms. It became a hit as a Vita exclusive in 2014 for its unique persistent world mechanics and dystopian sci-fi premise that made it more than just something that played off its influences. And I can tell you first-hand that there’s a certain excitement to Freedom Wars Remastered since it’s as true to the original release as you could possibly expect.</p><p>I had the chance to get roughly four hours of hands-on time with a preview build of Freedom Wars Remastered on PlayStation 5. After spending about an hour with the tutorial to shake off the decade of rust, I jumped back into high-level operations. In the following three hours, I cleared several instanced missions hunting massive monster-like machines and rescuing civilians from their clutches – and unwittingly tacked on extra years to my prison sentence by acting a fool back in the Panopticon you call home.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Freedom Wars Remastered - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If you’re not familiar with Freedom Wars, or need a refresher since it’s been quite some time, it takes place in a dystopia set in the far future where the surviving population fights over limited resources. People are either wardens running a Panopticon or prisoners (aka Sinners) stuck in indentured servitude and forced to fight for “a greater good.” You play as a Sinner, and by taking on operations and contributing resources to your Panopticon, you shave years off your…1,000,000-year prison sentence. Aside from sending yourself to instanced hunts, there is a story that develops as you get deeper in operations and learn more about fellow Sinners on your prison block. </p><p>You’re also under constant surveillance by an android companion, called an Accessory, who applies disciplinary action, and you earn little bits of freedom as you clear more missions. Something worth noting here is that the remaster features expanded voice acting and English audio – that includes the androids, which has been done oddly. Android characters are voiced through a primitive text-to-speech style modulator that clearly mispronounces words; it’s said to be intentional to add to the creepy dystopian vibe, but it comes off rather tacky. Overall, it’s a dark premise, for sure, but it’s satirical in a way that has only gotten more bleak as time goes on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Everything that made the original a Vita classic either remains intact or has been touched up to mitigate frustrations,</p></div><p>I talked to Takashi Tsukamoto, the original director and now producer for the remaster, and Tetsunosuke Seki, the director for the remaster, and they reflected on the commentary of Freedom Wars. Tsukamoto saw new developments in Japan as inspiration for the dystopian vision of Freedom Wars’ story, saying, “When the original version came out 10 years ago, there was a thing called My Number in Japan, similar to the US with social security numbers. This was a very new concept in Japan 10 years ago. Citizens of Japan didn't have a social security equivalent and since it was a brand new idea coming up, there were a lot of people who were against it. Like, don't put a number on us. I guess living in a first-world country like Japan, they always have your information on hand. You're on file. It's kind of like you're being in constant surveillance. When you're walking around the city, there's cameras everywhere. There's a little bit of a parallel between that and this game. Obviously, we're not in a prison, but the idea of being in constant surveillance and people having our information was a very strong concept we wanted to work with when creating this game. In the game these people are prisoners with million-year sentences, it’s not a one-to-one, obviously. I mean, I hope I'm not a prisoner!”</p><p>The story and premise remain intact in the remaster, exactly as it was in the 2014 release, and that faithfulness extends to the gameplay mechanics, for better and worse. Aside from the control scheme being updated to make sense for modern gamepads, the gameplay is pretty much one-to-one as I remember it. Lock-on targeting, third-person shooting, melee combos, the Thorn system, all of that is unchanged – so if you thought it was janky back then, you’ll definitely find it janky now. Don’t come in expecting it to be streamlined or revamped to feel like a new release. However, there’s a novelty to the way Freedom Wars experimented with unique mechanics and brought it all together in a fully fledged action-RPG on Vita.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While every character has a melee weapon for basic light and/or heavy attack combos and a firearm to take shots from a distance, it’s the Thorns that made Freedom Wars standout. Thorns are akin to hookshots or Spider-Man’s webs – you can attach these to enemies to slam them on the ground or zip right onto them to get in melee range. It’s also the key to traversal, letting you reach high-up places or quickly dart around the battlefield to stay nimble. Considering it’s a little sticky since it remains unchanged, it still works really well as an intuitive gameplay mechanic and a premier feature that made Freedom Wars a ton of fun to begin with.</p><p>There’s still a thrill to attaching your Thorn to a specific part of a beastly machine, frantically mashing the circle button to pull it to the ground, leaving it staggered and vulnerable to melee combos. And it’s also a novelty to use your Thorn to pull yourself toward a towering robot to mount it and sever one of its limbs before backflipping off to avoid getting tossed down, not unlike the rush we all got that same year scurrying up the backs of the Titans in Titanfall. Thorns serve other functions as a means for utility on the battlefield, like setting up traps, throwing out area-of-effect heals for your party, or casting powerful shields. It’s not terribly complex, but there’s beauty in its simplicity, and I still got a kick out of it while playing the remaster.</p><p>It remains my favorite thing in Freedom Wars – using my Thorn to latch onto the pod of an Abductor to rip out the hostage it's captured, and jumping off of it with the hostage in your arms before dashing back to safety. Not only are you caught in the fray of your party fighting this huge robot, but you’re risking heavy damage if you can’t execute it swiftly enough. And man, it feels good to get away with it scot-free.</p><p>Because this is a faithful remake, I found the structure of operations – the instanced missions that mainly drive the gameplay loop – to be somewhat repetitive. Even at Code 4 operations, which are several hours deep into the story, many of the maps and enemy types are reused. Different missions pop up to add variety, such as hostage rescues, wave-based encounters, or straight-up brawls of attrition against hulking damage sponges that’ll take 10 to 15 minutes to conquer. However, it tends to fall into a routine after long sessions; not that it’s absolved of its shortcomings that were apparent back in 2014, but the repetition was better suited as a handheld game played in shorter bursts.</p><p>Freedom Wars doesn’t necessarily evolve fundamentally as it goes on, and from what I can recall from my time on the Vita version and now with the remaster, you settle into a playstyle and stick with it throughout. You’re still upgrading weapons with the materials you gather and earning new ones from mission to mission. There’s a decent amount of weapon types to mess around with before settling on what works for you – personally, I loved the chainsaw sword for chunky melee damage and the burst-shot rifle that could melt fodder from a distance. The one quality-of-life change worth noting here is that weapon crafting and upgrades are streamlined to take the old randomized aspects out of the process. This aligns with crafting systems seen in modern games, and this was a deliberate decision according to Tsukamoto and Seki.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a dark premise, for sure, but it’s satirical in a way that has only gotten more bleak as time goes on.</p></div><p>The biggest idea behind Freedom Wars was the persistent world aspect of Panopticons. Players would sign onto their own Panopticons based on region and the missions they take on would all contribute to its status, and you would be ranked against rival Panopticons in perpetuity, as if it was this ongoing multiplayer competition without having to do direct PvP. That remains intact with the remaster. Traditional multiplayer and co-op was a major part of the original Freedom Wars, though, and it’s also being preserved. Although I didn’t get to try it out, Tsukamoto and Seki both said that matchmaking has been revamped to reflect that of modern games, which will be a vast improvement over the original’s system.</p><p>Part of me sees Freedom Wars Remastered more as a novelty – a Vita classic that is now at least playable on modern platforms with its most important parts unsullied, for better or worse. It’s fundamentally the 2014 game with some quality-of-life necessities. It was a perfect fit for Sony’s last handheld, and a blast to sink hours into, competing with other Panopticons across your region and reducing your prison sentence in futility. I’m not sure if it’s going to hit the same way it did 10 years ago, but I do believe this is a big win for preservation, making a cult classic much more accessible in a faithful form. Freedom Wars was experimental for its time, and it tried new ideas that are great to see holding up relatively well – even just constantly adding years to your sentence for minor infractions as you roam your prison block was an annoying but good goof that fed into the game’s overall themes.</p><p>Novelty or not, both Seki and Tsukamoto stated that remastering the original game is the necessary first step in hopes of revitalizing the series. Tsukamoto said, “We’ve been wanting to create something like this for a long time, but we really didn't have the opportunity. As Dimps [the development team], we’ve been looking for opportunities to release <em>something</em>, maybe a sequel – something related to Freedom Wars. However, it was very difficult to set up a team and nothing was really lining up. At some point, we said maybe a remastered version of the original would be good.” As for why it made sense now to revisit the series, he continued, “The opportunity never really presented itself until now. We were able to come to an agreement with Sony regarding the license and they were able to partner up with Bandai Namco, and it just so happens that it’s about 10 years later that all of it started coming to fruition.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/vlcscreenshot2024-09-17-15h14m37s295-1726611590880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>I followed up by asking about how they’ll define success for the remaster and how a sequel would factor into their plans in the future. Tsukamoto said, “What success would look like is for this game to do well, and well enough that we could take the next step into potentially releasing a sequel.” He continued by saying, “As much as we’d like to share it with you, we don't know if there's going to be a sequel yet of course, but if there is a sequel, we have tons of ideas we’d want to implement into said sequel.”</p><p>It’s pretty wild to see a Vita game remastered with many of its assets true to what they looked like in original form. On PlayStation 5, Freedom Wars Remastered runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, which is really nice, although it does create a sort of uncanny valley effect when the character models, animations, and environments haven’t gotten a makeover. I also played a bit of the Nintendo Switch version in handheld mode and though it’s considerably lower resolution and only ran at 30 fps – it’s still very much playable, but it’s a bit disappointing to see a former Vita game struggle on Switch. While it’s definitely not a technical marvel by any measure, everything that made the original a Vita classic either remains intact or has been touched up to mitigate frustrations not present in modern games. </p><p>You’ll be able to start serving and working time off of your 1,000,000-year sentence when Freedom Wars Remastered launches on January 10, 2025 for PlayStation 4 and 5, PC via Steam, and Nintendo Switch.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-cutting-edge-ai-concept-imagines-a-pile-of-boxes.983961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Picture, if you will, a world in which your wildest gameplay whims can come to life in an instant – no muss, fuss, or coding required. What would you do? What vast possibility spaces would you pluck from the infinite realms of your imagination? At <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1836129684351791337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent investor event</a>, EA went with boxes.</p><p>EA chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya introduced the company’s new “Imagination to Creation” AI pipeline with a concept video, meaning one made with intention – almost certainly by human beings – to convey why this thing is The Future. And yet, able to mock up pretty much anything, especially given the pie-in-the-heavens rhetoric the letters A and I often inspire, EA settled on two “community-designed” generi-characters hopping around a glorified box fort.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“Make it more epic.”</p><p>⁰EA Chief Strategy officer Mihir Vaidya demonstrates how EA plans to super-charge user-created game content with AI in this concept video "Imagination to Creation" from EA’s Investor Day event in NYC today. <a href="https://t.co/sgBnawF7rK">pic.twitter.com/sgBnawF7rK</a></p></div>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1836129684351791337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Commands like “make it more complex” and “make it multi-level” just added more boxes, seemingly with little rhyme or reason, let alone attention to meaningful level design. After some light skirmishing, one player – sounding as much like a real person as every other actor in the industry’s long history of labored co-op game “demos” – told the AI to “make it more epic.” This, too, added more boxes.</p><p>Vaidya boasted that in this currently-imaginary vision of the future, users will be able to take elements from EA games’ asset libraries and remix them. “Elements like characters, gameplay systems, weapons, and logic,” he said. If you’re an investor, the target audience for this presentation, I’m sure you were floored. Infinite content with minimal input. Gray slop oozing forth from an endless faucet. Finally, your precious numbers and lines can go up forever.</p><p>But EA’s concept video – which, again, could have been <em>anything </em>but for some reason settled on boxes – mostly demonstrates how profoundly unimaginative this whole enterprise is. Assuming EA can create something that reliably works this way – itself a big if – then you’re basically getting a set of Legos that a machine assembles for you. Direct control is minimal. You just lob prompts at the AI and see what it spits out. And these building blocks come from preexisting games, so the end result will necessarily be a mishmash of ideas and characters with no understanding of how they are meant to fit together, because AI cannot understand.</p><p>This is a solution in search of a problem. Modding communities have been remixing their favorite games for nearly as long as video games have existed, and they’re thriving. There are arguably too many mods of popular games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skyrim</em></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/im-in-awe-of-how-hard-this-new-doom-track-goes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Doom</em></a><em> </em>– more than any single person could ever try. These were born of actual creativity and ingenuity; instead of painting firmly within the lines – as AI must – modders redefined them, in the process creating some of today’s most popular genres (not to mention <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/IceFrog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landing</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-london-mod-4-skyrim-pc-hired-bethesda-fan-dev-1849136115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">themselves</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2#Development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>, in some cases).&nbsp;</p><p>If this year has shown us anything, it’s that people <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t want derivative games made of parts from cast-off playsets</a>. They want experiences that legitimately spirit them and their friends away to new places, that are exciting enough to dislodge them from established games that have become comforting daily rituals. To call what EA is doing “imagination” is an insult to the word. Nobody in this process is imagining anything. Piece by piece, box by box, EA is attempting to build a rehash machine, one in which players whose data the company is hoovering up are all cogs. Let us hope it does not succeed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The main hook, Chief Experiences Officer David Tinson says, is its tie-ins with EA's various sports games, including the possibility of unlocking prizes like Ultimate Team cards based on the sizzle reel.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-52-27-screenshot-1726608647296.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The EA Sports app is being touted as a new way to engage with sports using EA's existing technology.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Our thesis is simple: With the right products, features, and capabilities, a significant portion of hyper valuable consumer attention is available for a fraction of the cost," Tinson says.</p><p>Ultimately, Tinsons says EA's goal is to create a social app that allows fans to follow their favorite sports and teams while integrating in-game rewards and community elements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tinson showcased a number of features that incorporate EA's technology, including a system that appears to seamelssly translate real-life moments into virtual highlights that can be viewed from any angle using the EA Sports FC engine. EA is also introducing predictive simulations that not only simulate upcoming matches, but can also questions like "who would win between 85 Bears and the 07 Patriots."</p><p>Based on Tinson's presentation, the app appears to make heavy use of AI, featuring prompts that allows users to create its simulations. Generative AI was a big part of EA's overall presentation, and was touted repeatedly in relation to franchises like The Sims and its sports games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-58-20-screenshot-1726608686364.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>EA claims the new app will let you view highlights from any angle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The EA Sports app will initially be focused around soccer, making it an extension of one of EA's most popular and successful sports sims in EA Sports FC.

According to Seagate's website, this SSD normally retails for $220, so this is a 40% price drop. The Firecuda 530R works equally well as storage expansion for your PS5 console - it will triple your existing storage capacity - or as a blazing fast boot drive for your gaming rig.</p><h2>2TB Seagate Firecuda 530R 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h2><div catalogid="77b17120-1386-4338-907b-52882079c649" id="143896"><div id="143896" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Seagate FireCuda 530R 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The Seagate Firecuda 530R is a direct successor to the 530, which was already one of the faster PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs on the market. Seagate is pretty tight-lipped about what exact hardware or software changes were made, but we do know that the upgrades include a marked increase in random read and write speeds (IOPS) and a higher endurance rating. The Firecuda 530R boasts sustained read  speeds of 7,800MBps and write speeds of 6,800MBps which is well above Sony's PS5 recommendation of 5,600MBps. It's also equipped with a robust EK-designed aluminum heatsink that's slim enough to fit both PS5 and PS5 slim drive bays (the new 530R removes the EK logo and replaces it with a Seagate logo). Of course, the same specs make it a prime candidate for your gaming PC boot drive. It's still one of the fastest drives on the market and goes toe to toe with other heavy hitters like the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black SN850X, and the SK Hynix P41 Platinum.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more SSD storage upgrade options for your PS5 console, check out our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023"><em>best PS5 SSD deals of 2024</em></a><em>.

Most notably, the new model comes with Hall Effect triggers and sticks, which also support the Quick-Twist feature that lets you adjust the height of your thumbsticks on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">Other notable features include four remapppable back buttons and a rubberized grip. The controller connects to Xbox Series X|S or PC via an included 10-foot braided USB-C cable, and sports a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the Fusion Pro 3 had swappable sticks, which have been replaced by the Quick-Twist sticks. The only potential downside to this change is that you can no longer have different thumbstick cap options. The Pro 3 came with a pair of short sticks with concave caps, and a pair of tall sticks, one concave and one convex. That said, the Quick-Twist sticks in the Fusion Pro 4 utilize Hall Effect technology to prevent stick drift, and you can lock them in three different positions, so overall it should be a positive change.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fusion Pro 4 is available now for $70 at Amazon, which is $10 less than the launch price of the Fusion Pro 3.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Behaviour Interactive has cancelled its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> four-player co-op spin-off, known only as Project T, after early player testing "yielded unsatisfactory overall results".
</p>
<p>
Project T, developed by Midwinter Entertainment, was an attempt to create a PvE experience set in the Dead by Daylight universe. It would see four players - cast as trespassers in the Entity's realm - tackling new enemies The Thrall using guns, trucks, and talismans.
</p>
<p>
At the time of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-adding-dungeons-dragons-and-castlevania-chapters-this-year">announcement in May</a>, Project T was described as being very early in development, but Behaviour Interactive revealed it would be launching an Insider Programme to gather fan feedback. Unfortunately, it seems the responses weren't especially glowing.

<p>
"When we conceptualised Project T," Behaviour Interactive wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262">statement announcing the game's cancellation</a> on social media, "we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which lead to the creation of the Insiders Program. This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on the project's core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game."
</p>
<p>
"Following the playtest in July," the developer continued, "we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective. While a number of players expressed appreciation for what they played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results."
</p>
<p>
"It's with heavy heart," the statement concluded, "that we announce that Project T has been cancelled. We want to thank you for your support throughout this journey."
</p>
<p>
When Project T was unveiled back in May, it was accompanied by news of two additional Dead by Daylight spin-offs. Until Dawn developer Supermassive's narrative adventure The Casting of Frank Stone launched earlier this month, garnering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review">three stars from Eurogamer</a>, while What The Fog - a free two-person co-op roguelite - was only briefly made available.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s new Doug-Cockle-starring animated Witcher movie, Sirens of the Deep, has had its release pushed back from "late" this year to 11th February 2025. But to tide everyone over until then, the streaming service has shared a two-minute clip featuring some familiar faces.
</p>
<p>
Sirens of the Deep - Netflix's second animated Witcher movie, following 2021's well-received The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf - begins with Geralt of Rivia investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village, but our gravelly voiced protagonist soon finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p>
<p>
"He must count on friends — old and new," Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-next-animated-witcher-movie-will-star-doug-cockle-as-geralt">previously teased</a>, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

<p>
The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, an adaptation of Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski's short story A Little Sacrifice, is being directed by Kang Hei Chul, who previously helmed Nightmare of the Wolf. It sees Cockle reprising his role as Geralt - following his iconic turn in CD Projekt's The Witcher series of games - and he's accompanied by The Witcher TV show's Joey Batey as Jaskier. Both feature in Netflix's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8P2Nodqzpc">new two-minute clip</a>, which you'll find above.
</p>
<p>
Batey, of course, is set to return as Jaskier for the final two seasons of Netflix's wildly uneven live-action Witcher adaptation - which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">see Liam Hemsworth stepping into the role of Geralt</a> following Henry Cavill's departure at the end of Season 3.
</p>
<p>
Cockle recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-video-game-voice-star-weighs-in-on-netflix-adaptation">shared his thoughts</a> on the live-action series, admitting, "I don't know why they made those choices and I'd love to have a chat with some of the writers about why those choices were made just so I can intellectually understand why."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tsa-approved-power-bank-deal-20000-mah-for-nintendo-switch-for-19<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Charges the Nintendo Switch up to 2.8 times</h2></div><div><section><p>Starting this week, Amazon is offering the very popular <a href="https://zdcs.link/znOLZy?object_uuid=f0caefd3-3ee2-4dab-8b1a-ac0a38af6ea9&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIU 20,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</a> for only $18.89 after you clip the 30% off coupon on the product page. This is a great price for a power bank that features a spacious 20,000mAh capacity and a 22.5W USB Type-C charging output that's enough to max out the charging rate on the Nintendo Switch. INIU hasn't been long around enough to develop the same reputation as Anker, but their power banks have been steadily racking up favorable reviews and they're definitely a lot less expensive than a comparable Anker power bank. This particular model has nearly 20,000 reviews on Amazon with a 4.6-star rating.</p><h2>INIU 20,000mAh Power Bank for $18.89</h2><p><em><strong>Clip the 30% off coupon</strong></em></p><div catalogid="97fbf52d-392a-4fd5-b10f-ab8444983cbb" id="207506"><div id="207506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>INIU 20,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p>The INIU power bank is pretty compact for its capacity, measuring 5.3"x2.8"x1". It's also one of the lighter 20,000mAh power banks, weighing in at 12.8 ounces.  The power bank features three ports: two USB Type-A ports and one USB Type-C ports. The USB Type-C ports is both input and output and has the highest charging capacity at 22.5W. The Nintendo Switch supports a maximum charging rate of 18W, so this power bank will charge the Switch in the shortest amount of time possible. The 20,000mAh capacity will charge a Nintendo Switch about 2.8 times even after factoring in 60% charging efficiency. That should be more than enough for all but the longest trips.  It's worth mentioning that the INIU power bank also has a little LED flashlight for emergencies.</p><h2>The INIU Power Bank is TSA-Approved</h2><p>Spare lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, must be carried in carry-on baggage only. Power banks must be under either 27,000mAh or 100Whr in capacity. This INIU power bank features a 20,000mAh battery capacity, which is well below TSA's 27,000mAh limit, so it can be brought onto airplanes without worry. This power bank is small and discreet enough that it's hard to imagine TSA even noticing the power bank in the first place.</p><p><em>Looking for more alternatives?

Image source: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>A commenter claiming to be Karch weighed in on a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBUqCUZ0swE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Asmongold</a> focusing on Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, where they expounded on what they considered to be the state of the modern games industry. The full comment is below.</p><blockquote>Hey man. CEO of Saber here. I love your videos. When we signed the deal to make Space Marine 2, all I wanted was a throwback game. We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was "old school". I can't even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days.<p> They are too complex and too much of an investment. We worked on Halo back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting. That is what we wanted to recapture. I hope that games like Space Marine 2 and Wukong are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion.</p></blockquote><blockquote>I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers. We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little. For me that is what games should be about.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The comment quickly got picked up and began making the rounds on various social platforms, with some wondering if the comment was actually from Karch. IGN reached out to the Embracer Group asking for confirmation one way or another, but did not receive a response. The account purporting to belong to Karch has no videos and 197 subscribers.</p><p>Saber Interactive is fresh off the release of Space Marine 2, which arrived in early September and quickly amassed around 2 million players. A sequel to a fan-favorite Xbox 360 release, it has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-next-gen-xbox-360-shooter-best-way-possible">drawn comparisons to other shooters from that era</a>.</p><p>"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 may not break the third-person shooter mold, but it looks amazing, makes good use of its Warhammer lore, and has brutal combat that just feels great," we wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">our review</a>.</p><p>Space Marine 2 is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Project T had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-8th-anniversary-stream-everything-announced">begun testing with insiders earlier this year</a>. </p><p>"Following the playtest in July, we ran through internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective," Behaviour said in the statement, which you can read in full below. "While a number of players expressed appreciation for what they played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/TfIpAk06Mm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TfIpAk06Mm</a></p>— Behaviour Interactive (@Behaviour) <a href="https://twitter.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Behaviour revealed a behind-the-scenes look at Project T <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/project-t-official-reveal-behind-the-scenes-video">back in May</a>, but little was known about the horror action-shooter otherwise. It was to be set in a region called The Backwater, and Behaviour promised it would expand the world of Dead by Daylight with "new characters, gameplay, and settings – as well as a few familiar elements for those in the know."</p><p>It was being developed by Midwinter Entertainment, but had never set a release window, with the FAQ on its website saying it was still "currently in the very early stages of development." "It is not our goal to use the Insider Program to finetune a nearly complete game, but rather to create it alongside you at a stage where your feedback can matter most," it added.</p><p>No further details were revealed regarding other projects at the studio, although Dead by Daylight continues to get new content. It added a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylights-castlevania-chapter-is-coming-later-this-month">Castlevania chapter late last month</a>, and teased a number of other big additions during its 8th anniversary stream in May. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/spellbreak-battle-royale-community-servers-blizzard-proletariat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You generally want to avoid being the game that everybody agrees “deserved better,” but that was <em>Spellbreak </em>in a nutshell. The multiplayer battle royale about wizards throwing down the gauntlet – a wide variety of them, in fact – conjured visions of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> when it was at its best, with players hurling boulders and whipping up tornadoes as they frantically flitted about the battlefield. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/spellbreak-is-avatar-the-last-airbender-the-battle-ro-1844999545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive reviews</a>, the game wasn’t able to maintain a large enough audience, and in 2022 developer Proletariat announced that it would be <a href="https://www.gamedaily.biz/spellbreak-servers-will-shut-down-in-2023-blizzard-to-acquire-developer-proletariat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down its servers and joining Blizzard</a>. But unlike a great many other games that have faced similar fates, <em>Spellbreak </em>remains playable.</p><p>As <a href="https://x.com/DominicTarason/status/1835788217066328209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> by ever-reliable indie game guy Dominic Tarason, <em>Spellbreak</em>’s dev team posted a free version of the game that <a href="https://sbcommunity.itch.io/spellbreak-community-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lets players host their own servers</a> not long after announcing the shutdown.&nbsp;</p><p>“Like many of you, we were sad to see the development of <em>Spellbreak </em>come to a close,” wrote <em>Spellbreak</em>’s developers. “In order to help memorialize <em>Spellbreak </em>and allow players to continue to enjoy the Hollow Lands, we created a standalone version where players can host their own servers, play with their friends, and explore the game-space at their own pace.”</p><p>In the intervening period, <em>Spellbreak</em>’s community has created a Discord server with over 5,000 users called Elemental Fracture that hosts daily games, weekly events, and provides other resources. They’ve even <a href="https://elefrac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put together their own launcher</a> to make the process of getting the game up and running simpler. You can <a href="http://dsc.gg/elefrac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">join the server here</a>, if you’d like.&nbsp;</p><p>“Elemental Fracture emerged from this unique moment in <em>Spellbreak</em>'s history,” wrote one of the server’s moderators in its “Who We Are” section. “Our mission is simple yet powerful: we want to bring our <em>Spellbreak </em>community together to resurrect the game we love. Whether you're a seasoned pro who has been part of <em>Spellbreak</em>'s journey from the beginning or someone discovering this captivating game for the first time, we wholeheartedly welcome you to our community. Here, friendships are made and flourish, skills sharpen, and the passion for <em>Spellbreak </em>burns brighter than ever. Join us on this exciting adventure of reviving this wonderful game.”</p><p>This, if you ask me, is what <em>should </em>happen any time a company is forced to pull the plug on a server-based game: Let players preserve it to whatever degree they’re able. As is, 87 percent of games released before 2010 are unplayable, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Video Game History Foundation</a>, and the proliferation of online multiplayer games in the years since means that number is likely to rise. There’s only one way to stem the tide, and we’re looking at it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We already knew another Star Wars Jedi game was in the works at developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>, but EA has now confirmed it'll be the "final chapter" in Cal Kestis' saga.
</p>
<p>
Not-quite-official word of a third Star Wars Jedi game first surfaced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-3-is-on-the-way-according-to-cal-kestis-actor-cameron-monaghan">last October</a> when Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan told fans, "We're in the process of [making it] right now". Formal confirmation of its development then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-star-wars-strategy-game-still-in-development-following-layoffs">followed this February</a>, shared as part of a projects update in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">significant layoffs</a> at EA.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, speaking during EA's latest <a href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">Investor Day presentation</a>, the company's president of entertainment and technology, Laura Miele, has shared the first bit of solid information on Star Wars Jedi's third instalment, confirming it to be the last. "Over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi," Miele said. "Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> director Stig Asmussen - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-and-survivor-director-stig-asmussen-is-leaving-ea">departed EA last year</a> - previously revealed the series had been envisaged as a trilogy during a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy">IGN</a>. "We had a pretty decent idea of timeframe where we wanted Survivor to take place," he explained, "what the stakes were going to be, what the tone of the game was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how the crew was going to factor into that. And there's ideas of what we could do beyond that as well."
</p>
<p>
However, today's announcement confirms Respawn is now officially bringing Cal Kestis' story to a close, even if no other details have so far been shared.
</p>
<p>
All this Star Wars Jedi chatter coincides with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-september-release-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">today's launch</a> of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and follows the recent release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-fresh-pc-patch-17-months-after-release">new Star Wars Jedi: Survivor patch for PC</a>, promising performance fixes, the removal of Denuvo DRM, and more.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA confirmed that The Sims 5 wasn't and isn't in the works<span>. Instead, they are focusing on funneling more into The Sims 4, a ten-year-old title. A couple of months ago,<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">&nbsp;Project Rene</a> seemed like it was scrapped, according to a developer's resume. However,&nbsp;<span>according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">Variety's statement</a></span>, this does not seem to be</span>&nbsp;the case, and they are continuing to work on Project Rene, which is said to be a separate multiplayer project in The Sims universe.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has also confirmed that there are no plans for a successor to The Sims 4, which is currently the longest-running installment in the franchise's history. The first game was released 25 years ago. It's been confirmed that The Sims 4 will continue receiving free updates and paid expansions.</p>
<p>In addition to The Sims 4 continuing to receive paid content, EA has confirmed that the Sims team is working on a new project that will include a multiplayer mode, as well as partnering up with some Sims creators so that they can sell their custom in-game content through the EA store, similar to how it was done in The Sims 3.</p>
<p>Kate Gorman said that the main reason they have decided not to make The Sims 5 is an overwhelming concern that players would have to "start all over again" after a decade's worth of gameplay in The Sims 4. There are more than 80 million players worldwide, with a very active social media community. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise starts with Sims 1, and then Sims 2, 3, and 4. And they were seen as replacements for the previous products."</p>
<p>Recently, EA announced in a blog post that some significant fixes will be released for the game, something the fans have consistently asked for when providing feedback for EA. They are also releasing an "exciting base game update" before their upcoming expansion in October, for which they are slowly releasing information. In this <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-season-of-to-be-continued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, they revealed the Life and Death expansion, where players will get their first proper look at the content on October 3 before it releases on Halloween. So far, it seems to focus on tarot and perhaps new jobs and skills.</p>

<p>In this interview with Variety, EA also mentioned that Sims fans will get to hear more about the elusive Project Rene, which the Sims team has been working on for years. This isn't their first rodeo in trying to make a multiplayer Sims game, with The Sims Online launching in 2002 and the game shutting down entirely in 2008, which was seen as a failed experiment.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has released an updated Year One roadmap for its free-to-play shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xdefiant/" data-ref-id="5000-534971">XDefiant</a>, highlighting important changes and new content coming down the road. The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is dying, stating that the game is in a healthy state and that Ubisoft has provided additional resources to the team to fix some of the larger issues, like hit registration.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG">blog post</a> starts by addressing the issues players have been having with the hit registration in XDefiant, which doesn't work as reliably as some other multiplayer shooters. The simplified explanation given is that currently packets are sent twice between players, but the industry standard is four times. In order to achieve this, the XDefiant team needs to reduce the size of their packets so they can send them more times. No solid release date was given, but the team hopes to make significant progress by the end of Season 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766"></a><figcaption>Season 2 will add the Highwaymen from Far Cry New Dawn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is in trouble at Ubisoft, although it doesn't respond directly to some of the claims. The report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> from late August stated that XDefiant player numbers have dropped off significantly since launch and that if Season 3 doesn't turn things around, the game could be in danger of shutting down. The blog post states that "no, the game is absolutely not dying," and reiterates that quality-of-life improvements are high on the priority list.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also includes an updated roadmap for XDefiant. It reiterates that each season will include three new maps, three new guns, and a new faction to play, but now it also lists progression changes and quality of life changes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-to-help-players-shoot-better-in-game-photos-for-no-cost<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before I worked in games, I was in TV and film production. Before I was in TV and Film production, I was in film school. Before I ever shot a moving picture, I took a photography course, and before I took that photography course, my Grandfather, Larry S. Cohan, taught me how to shoot photos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa also taught everyone in our family how to use computers. He should know, he'd been working on them since the 1960s. (Yes, the '60s. The reel-to-reel ones being installed on Navy Ships.) I heard opinions about the difference between Mac and PC devices long before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qfv6Ah_MVJU?si=TscED7Ym8erfPKa7">John Hodgman and Justin Long made it a TV campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He fell in love with photography later in life and approached it like a programmer, thinking very hard about the inputs of shots, and what kind of outcomes they'd produce.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In Fall 2009 he was published a (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://outlookbythebay.com/archived-issue/">still-archived</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) story called "Better Photos—No Cost" in a Maryland magazine called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://outlookbythebay.com/">Outlook by the Bay</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a publication for senior citizens of the Chesapeake Bay region. It documents the basics of photography he didn't just share with me but seemed obsessed with everyone having some understanding of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of his grumpiness still drips off the page. "Don't bore your friends with photos that would bore you if they weren't your own," he wrote. "If you're shooting the sunrise over Bar Harbor, Maine, don't try to include your half-asleep spouse." Sarcasm was a second language for Grandpa, but I remember he seemed sincerely frustrated at how his peers didn't understand the basics of photography, equaled only by his frustration of how they were intimidated by computers.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Photography Week, I revisited his guide and thought about how he was trying to teach fellow retirees better ways to take shots. They're good tips—ones I still think about when having fun in a photo mode like the ones in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're so good, in fact, that they could help you make a better photo mode for your next game. Let's run through them and think about how they could make for better photo modes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can you help players figure out what needs to be in the frame?">Can you help players figure out what needs to be in the frame?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One purpose, on purpose," is one of the first tips Grandpa Cohan wrote. "Think for just a few seconds about the purpose of the photo you're about to take. Compose in your mind before you compose in the viewfinder."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most modern games look so great just grabbing a screenshot of a moment in combat will catch the eye. When players open photo mode, they're committing to going a step further, maybe with a purpose in mind—but maybe not. Maybe they know there's a good shot here, but they don't know what it is yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most helpful tool I've seen here are the poses and facial expressions found in the most recent games from Sony's first-party studios like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Sony Santa Monica, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac Games all built tools that let players customize character poses and facial expressions. These can help players pick that "purpose." Should it be goofy, with Aloy doing a silly pose as a Thunderjaw rears at her? Or should it look like a comic panel, with Spider-Man's eyes going big and bug-eyed as he takes a punch?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He was always fixated on what should go in a frame. Photo modes have done a great job on this front, offering players guides to match "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://photographylife.com/the-rule-of-thirds">the rule of thirds</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." "Do not center the subject," he wrote, the emphasis so strong I can hear him saying it years later. He wanted amateur photographers to learn not to "vertically center" the horizon in landscape shots, making sure the photo was one-third sky and two-third ground, or vice versa.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan. First printed in Outlook by the Bay.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quickly shooting multiple angles was another trick up his sleeve, promising readers they'd be "glad" they took "at least four shots" of a scene from different angles. Here he could introduce the idea of how photos looked different at a 45-degree angle, or how they'd look from the ground-up or from overhead. Ubisoft's got a feature that makes this easy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, letting players set a "Camera A" and "Camera B" to flip between. I wonder if photo modes would benefit from creating Cameras C and D.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't agree with his advice that should avoid "candid camera" shots. "When shooting a party, don't try to be a photojournalist or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Funt">Allen Funt</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shooting surreptitiously," he wrote. Sometimes it's just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to snap and move on....is that true in games too?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Could photo modes get more ambitious, and have ways to preserve camera settings that players could trigger at flick of a button? Could you make it so players can pre-set an angle, lens type, and focal distance for "Camera A," and press a key to have it ready to shoot a photo of the player character in an instant. We have "instant replay" modes that grab video from players at camera angles they don't normally play in after all...</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty to think about in helping players set up a shot. But getting the light just right is a whole other ball game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Look for the light">Look for the light</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hated</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the built-in flash of point-and-shoot lens. He was religious about scrubbing out that classic "red-eye" you'd get from photos that emerged because the flash sat so close to the lens. "These flash shots frequently are washed out or ghostly, showing harsh shadows and red eyes," he penned. He urged most photographers without fancy lighting equipment to just turn the flash off and work off of natural light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, Sony's first-party studios have jumped ahead here in giving players control of lighting, but Square Enix has been toying with this in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/uiguide/photo/gpose/gpose_what.html">its photo mode</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the critically acclaimed MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XIV. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Lighting is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> though. I went through four years of film school and still smack my head in exasperation when I see the answer to a lighting question I failed to understand back then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most people think you have to point a light directly at your subject to "light" it, maybe adjusting it with a filter so they don't think about how you can bounce the light off other objects to create softer or harsher shades depending on what they need.</span></p><p>Image via Respawn Entertainment/EA. Shot by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basic time-of-day controls in games with day/night cycles will help players cue up the "golden hour" aesthetic, generally seen in the real world in the two hours after sunrise and the two hours before sunset. This is when colors from the sun's light are warmer, the shadows are longer, and the angle on the light is in a space to not generate what Grandpa called "raccoon eyes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But lately I've been frustrated by how even if you can set the time of day in a photo mode to perfect golden hour time, you're still stuck with where the in-game sun is physically located in the game world. If we're at a point where players can add in-game light sources to fill in shots or change the type of lighting in the scene, could developers allow the sun itself be moved around the same way?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(The lighting programmers in the comments are probably screaming at me).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa's last advice for Maryland retirees has to do with how many photos you share with your friends. His hypothetical stinger at the end about "Aunt Rose" handing the reader 128 prints while hovering over them might be close to home, given his mother's name was Rose. Reading this, it occurred to me—how do players even share screenshots with each other now?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Capture technology on consoles is easy but the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-4-and-playstation-5-lose-x-integration-next-week">degrading APIs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of Twitter and Facebook mean you can't share screenshots directly from PlayStation, Xbox, and the Nintendo Switch anymore on the formerly dominant social media sites. TikTok and Instagram integration never took off. Every platform would love you to just send screenshots to your friends on their system but look, I don't remember using PlayStation's "send to a friend" feature any time recently, do you?</span></p><p>Image via Square Enix Montreal/Square Enix. Shot by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've got all these great photo modes but no way for players to curate what they want to share. The mode that jumps quickly to mind would be something like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s player messages or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Stranding</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s structures—systems in games that could proliferate screenshots to players everywhere. Ubisoft ran with this for a while in its newer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games, surfacing photos on the in-game map, but I think that feature may have been more disruptive than helpful, at risk of spoiling content best left unspoiled and taking up space needed for icons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa was complaining about Aunt Rose's 128 prints and I'm sitting here shuffling a flash drive around to show you a few photos created in an entirely digital world. Something's gone wrong in the sharing section of photo modes, and it sure would be great to have it back.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Helping players have fun with photography">Helping players have fun with photography</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larry Cohan passed away in 2011 at the age of 75—before I was out of school, before I was working in games. I regularly catch myself going "I wish I could have shown him this" when booting up photo modes, or digging into how game tools work. He'd have understood so much of it—his favorite pastime in the '90s was playing flight simulators like LucasArts' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He wrote this photography guide because he was frustrated by how few people around him understood how to take good photos, but there's something under the frustration that rings through my memory. Grandpa could be extremely literal, often stubborn (like me). I think we shared certain challenges with cognitive load that could make complex ideas painfully difficult until we had that breakthrough.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the game-related memories I have of him was being frustrated nearly to the point of tears as I tried explain how the Nintendo Wii worked. He seemed frustrated too. I felt like he was frustrated with me, who couldn't communicate that the Wiimote used motion sensors and infrared tracking to work their magic. I wonder if he was frustrated with himself too, since he couldn't picture how the technology worked just based on my description of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a sense of "I figured it out, surely you can too!" in his writing, and I wonder if he at one point was having a hard time understanding how photography worked, and if he needed it broken down to the basics to understand how the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO all worked together.
