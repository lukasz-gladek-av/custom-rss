			<p>Empire of the Ants, the upcoming Unreal Engine 5 real-time strategy game based on a French sci-fi book, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the PS5 Pro launch lineup</a>, being scheduled to release on the same day (November 7).</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshly published interview</a> with developer Tower Five, Game Director Renaud Charpentier shared impressions on Sony's upcoming mid-generation console refresh. According to Charpentier, due to how games are made nowadays compared to the previous generation, PS5 games could take better advantage of the PS5 Pro hardware compared to PS4 Pro and PS4. Most titles nowadays also include variable resolution, offering even more scaling potential. Empire of the Ants won't support PlayStation Spectral Resolution because it came too late in the game's development phase. As for the comparison with PC, Charpentier noted that the two cannot be directly compared since a top-of-the-line PC costs between three and five times, and also consumes a lot more energy.</p>

<p><em><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It is a kind of natural evolution of the PS5 hardware, same paradigms but more processing power on the GPU and "ray tracing" cores. For us, the gain of about 50% more GPU processing power is the most interesting of course, as our game is GPU bound, not CPU bound.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is less pronounced)?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It seems comparable in terms of evolution philosophy. It is the same gen console but with better rendering capacities. Now, it is early and so hard to compare what the PS5 Pro will do for PS5 games to what the PS4 Pro did for PS4 games. But globally, it seems many games will go from 30 to 60 fps on the Pro version, and that's comparable to what we had on PS4 Pro. It will probably scale better for an engine version: most games today do not rely on frame rate to sync/time their simulations. So they are more capable of rendering faster without altering their behaviors.</em></p>
<p><em>On PlayStation 4, you still had fantastic games like Bloodborne, where the game can't run above 30 because the simulation is linked to the rendering. So if you don't modify the engine and render at 60 fps, then your game will run twice faster, all the game, so everything will be twice faster for the player. Such frame rate bound simulations were still relatively common in the PS4 era, and they made taking advantage of a GPU upscale much harder. So, possibly, PlayStation 5 games will take better advantage of the PS5 Pro's capacities. The fact that most games nowadays use a form of variable resolution also helps with scaling up the quality with the GPU.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>As said and as presented by Sony, it is expected that most games will double their frame rate on the Pro or improve scene quality if they were already running in 60 on a PS5. Still, maxed out PCs are kind of "no limit" so they will of course be more powerful, but you can't compare them. A maxed out PC is going to cost easily 3 to 5 times more and consume 3 to 5 times more electrical energy. But what is interesting and says a lot about the flattening silicon evolution curve is that your game on your monster PC is not going to look or play 3 to 5 times better than on a PS5 Pro console. There is a huge diminishing return now on high end silicon, and that might have an impact on the life cycle duration of console hardware.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will there be different modes for the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Empire of the Ants?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>No, there is a single 60 FPS mode, so double the frame rate of the PlayStation 5 version.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Are you using PSSR in Empire of the Ants?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We don't. It came very late in our development cycle for this game, so we stuck to the</em><br>
<em>Unreal equivalent.</em></p>

For $169, you can opt to swap out the DualSense’s standard triggers and bumpers with clicky alternatives that have shorter travel to improve response times while playing FPS games. You can also opt to upgrade the DualSense’s rubber membrane face buttons with microswitches so they have more of a clicky feel when pressed for $169, but if you want all of the controller’s buttons upgraded, that pushes the CubeSense’s price tag to $179.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gangstalk is a cat-and-mouse game in which you play both cat and mouse. It's a stalking game in which you are the person stalking you and also, you are the person being stalked. By you. Yes, I too am wearing an expression of puppy-eyed dismay and confusion. But it sounds interesting, sufficiently interesting that I can disregard the very loud DYSTOPIAN WORLD framing in the trailer.</p>

<p>Devised by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592360/Kitten_Burst/">Kitten Burst</a> developer Jam2go, Gangstalk is the tale of Cam, an urban explorer in a high-vis jacket with an emoji for a face. He's being hounded by the evil megacorp PANDO, who appear to specialise in the manufacture of digital ghosts. Or at least, he thinks he is. According to Wikipedia, gangstalking refers to "a set of persecutory beliefs in which those affected believe they are being followed, stalked, and harassed by a large number of people." So it's possible that all this is happening in Cam's poor befuddled noggin.</p>
<p>As the game begins, Cam has infiltrated a secret PANDO company town, Kudzu Vale, which reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blackout-club">The Blackout Club</a>'s ghoulish chunk of suburbia. There are hauntingly empty carparks, hauntingly empty shopping markets, and haunting pieces of high-concept scenery, like piles of smouldering TVs or gaggles of marionettes who definitely won't move when you look away. Active threats include predatory phantasms called Datamoshers, who look like Slender Men made of VHS crackly bits. But the intriguing part, again, is the whole "you are your own stalker" conceit.</p><p>In lieu of a generic camera system you will watch Cam "through the fragmented perspectives of CCTV Cameras, Devices, Agents, and the enigmatic Datamoshers". Sometimes, you're peeking through a CCTV camera in the corner, with the view rotating jerkily to follow him/you across the room. Sometimes, you're the horror chasing him/yourself, wobbling along as he/you disappear around corners, whereupon you'll presumably have to wait for yourself to catch up in order to keep... escaping from yourself. </p>
<p>While showing a soon-to-be victim from the killer's vantage is a familiar tactic, I feel like Gangstalk is trying to push beyond that clichéd cinematic device. It's teaching you to fear your own gaze, which poses a fun practical dilemma. Presumably, you'll have to walk the line throughout the game of being <em>just</em> visible enough to retain control.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3235140/GANGSTALK/">The Steam page</a> contains a note warning about "strong depictions of anxiety and paranoia", and this is certainly one of the fancier takes on such things I've stumbled on in a video game. I can imagine some ways it won't measure up to its potential, mind you. Perhaps the "stalker POV" stuff will just boil down to classic survival horror fixed vantage points, much of the time. Perhaps it'll just be laughable in practice. Perhaps it being laughable is the point. We'll find out sometime next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Hero Passive ability for the Mage is Magic Recovery, which recovers a little MP every time an enemy is stunned or defeated <strong>in overworld combat</strong>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-recommend-id="image://bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-recommend-id="image://bb2834f3df87fe23acaa238b0c364c86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That qualifier is extremely important, because it refers to striking enemies with an attack as you run around the dungeon, <em>not</em> going into the turn-based battle system.<br></p><p>While you can stun or defeat enemies this way as any class, the MP restoration works only for characters with the Mage archetype equipped, so make sure to go to Akademeia and speak to More (or use the Archetype Tree, if you have unlocked that in the main menu) to unlock the Mage class for everyone in your party, <strong>then make sure to Equip it on everyone</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-recommend-id="image://c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-recommend-id="image://c0194c20b40538cd99a8abd1a62033ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By the time you’re running out of MP, you <em>should</em> have enough MAG (the Archetype Tree currency) to unlock the Mage class, unless you already spent it on other classes and abilities.

You can attack enemies several times in the overworld (even slightly tougher enemies), and if you deplete the yellow gauge that appears when engaged in combat, they will be stunned.</p><p>Stunning enemies in this way is sufficient to regain MP for everyone in your party who has the Mage archetype equipped, and if you decide to battle the enemy while stunned, they’ll begin the fight already at half health.

It also tweaks the Abstract Daddy boss fight. Apparently, the boss wasn’t working properly and that made it harder for it to attack you.

<p>The mystery of who co-developer Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership has been solved. It has been uncovered that Acquire worked on the development of the game alongside Nintendo.</p>



<p>“Nintendo and Acquire are the authors of this software for the purposes of copyright,” a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1848377416328323547/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">copyright notice</a> on the game reads. It’s also been revealed that the game was developed in Unreal Engine 5 after copies of the game <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1848186451261002223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">were spotted in the wild.</a></p>







<p>If the name Acquire sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the same studio that worked with Square Enix on Octopath Traveler. The studio also worked on franchises like Way of the Samurai and Tenchu.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that neither Nintendo nor Acquire have confirmed the information. With the game set to release for Nintendo Switch on November 7, confirmation seems to be only a matter of time.</p>



<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is the sixth main game in the Mario &amp; Luigi series. Not only is it the debut of the series on the Nintendo Switch, but it’s the first main release since 2015’s Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam.  It’s also the first to not be developed by AlphaDream. The former developer went bankrupt and subsequently shut down in 2019.</p>



<p>What do you think of Acquire being the studio that helped develop Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership? Let us know in below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1056/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 and online multiplayer go hand in hand, and it should keep the player base occupied for another year. However, each Call of Duty title tends to change the rest of the content, so let’s see if a Campaign or Zombies appear.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: World at War was a game-changer as it introduced the popular Zombies game mode as a fun add-on to the usual Campaign and multiplayer offerings. Since then, we’ve enjoyed playing Spec Ops, Survival, Dead Ops, DMZ, MWZ, and other fun variations on the CoD formula.</p>



<p>Content is chopped and changed with every new entry—leading many to wonder what Treyarch has opted for in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 release</a>. We have the answers for you, so read below for full details.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-a-campaign">Does Black Ops 6 Have a Campaign?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready for a sitrep. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 does include a Campaign,</strong> and it’s set to be a multi-hour affair featuring Treyarch’s creative take on history. Whereas Modern Warfare stories are typically grounded affairs exploring military warfare, Black Ops narratives aren’t afraid to go off the deep end.</p>



<p>Black Ops Cold War explores brainwashing and mental manipulation and gives you two different endings to choose from. Whereas 2010’s Black Ops famously features Mason learning about the “numbers.”</p>



<p>Plenty of returning faces are seen in Black Ops 6—as you can see in the image above—and the Gulf War is the story’s focus this time.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-zombies">Does Black Ops 6 Have Zombies?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Braaains. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thankfully, <strong>Black Ops 6 features Zombies in its classic form</strong> with proper round-based Zombies and multiple maps already penciled in.</p>



<p>It’s been a strange few years for Zombies fans. After some amazing maps and the introduction of Outbreak in Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard featured the most barebones Zombies experience ever (and didn’t get much better), and Modern Warfare 3 went down the extraction shooter route with Zombies—which was fun but left me craving authentic Zombies.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 looks to be a return to peak Zombies. Terminus and Liberty Falls are two round-based maps set for launch, with a third map already in the works and set to arrive before the end of 2024. BLOPS 6 Zombies includes Wonder Weapons, Perks, and the usual array of gimmicks and Easter Eggs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/clash-of-the-space-titans-star-citizen-delayed-elite-dangerous-on-track/">planned May 2014 release</a> of that module was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/star-citizens-arena-commander-dogfighting-hits-1-0-release-milestone/">eventually delayed until December</a>. At the time, we noted that "a full release of the Star Citizen MMORPG [would be] expected near the end of 2016," a date that now seems as naive as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/star-citizen-production-schedule-release/">original 2015 launch window for <em>Squadron 42</em></a>.</p>
<h2>“We will build the game you are dreaming about”</h2>
<p>Back in 2014, Roberts Space Industries had raised a mere $67 million from crowdfunders eager to see Roberts' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/star-citizens-chris-roberts-discusses-upping-the-ante-on-pc-gaming/">lofty vision for a new era of space simulation games</a>. Now, that funding has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">climbed past a staggering $731 million</a> from players buying <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/a-complete-star-citizens-ship-collection-now-costs-48000/">pricey virtual ships</a> in a game that still exists only as an unpolished alpha <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/star-citizen-faces-major-server-outage-still-isnt-close-to-launch/">plagued</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/star-citizen-still-hasnt-launched-but-its-already-banning-cheaters/">significant gameplay issues</a>.</p>
<p>Roberts <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">said in a March update</a> that the team had "spent significant time looking at what <em>Star Citizen</em> 1.0 means and what it would take to get there." For now, though, the team "is hard at work, heads down, driving toward the finish line" for <em>Squadron 42</em>, as highlighted by <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/progress-tracker/teams">the game's public progress tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The extremely lengthy development path for <em>Star Citizen</em> and <em>Squadron 42</em> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/star-citizen-dev-offers-roadmap-for-development-of-new-development-roadmap/">become something of a joke</a> in the 12 years since it first became a crowdfunding darling. But it's not like we weren't warned. In 2012, Roberts Space Industries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121128182541/https://robertsspaceindustries.com/the-pledge">offered a public pledge</a> that the use of crowdfunding meant the developer would "focus on quality free of the pressure to deliver by a certain financial quarter." The team also warned that "there may be delays and there may be changes; we recognize that such things are inevitable and would be lying to you if we claimed otherwise."</p>
<p>"You’ve done your part, and we will now do our utmost to live up to your expectations," the team wrote in that now 12-year-old pledge. "We will build you the game you are dreaming about."</p>

But with three episodes left,this might not be the last twist<em> Agatha All Along</em> has in store for viewers, which is why a new theory has been making the rounds online: What if the show’s main premise, the journey along the Witches’ Road, is a creation of (spoiler alert) Billy Maximoff’s?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197298,197284" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If for some reason you haven’t already caught up with the show, over the last two weeks, <em>Agatha All Along</em> finally revealed that Joe Locke’s mysterious character Teen is none other than William Kiplan, aka Billy Maximoff, aka Wiccan, the son of Scarlet Witch (We have a more in-depth explanation of this reveal that you can read <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452">here</a></span>). Billy has some of his mothers powers and has been hiding who he is from Agatha and the rest of the coven so he can complete the Witches’ Road, the legendary path that gives those who complete it the thing they most desire, and discover what happened to his twin brother, Tommy. However, with Billy still trying to get control over his powers, some think that he is the unconscious inventor of this version of the Witches’ Road.<br></p><p>This theory is supported by a few key pieces of evidence. The first is that, despite claims to the contrary, it still seems like Agatha herself is extremely unfamiliar with the Witches’ Road and its trials. It’s previously been theorized that she is lying about having completed the road, so she wouldn’t be able to tell if it’s indeed the real trial or a fake one. Second, the summoning of the door to the road in the second episode also only worked when Billy ran down to the rest of the coven and entered it first as he fled from the Salem Seven, who were hunting Agatha. The summoning didn’t work for Agatha, it worked for Billy because he was able to create it using the same powers of reality manipulation that his mother has.</p><p>The final piece of evidence is the form in which the trials of the Witches’ Road take. Each episode involving a trial transports the coven into a setting themed after a specific time period or style. We’ve had a <em>Real Housewives</em>-themed beach home, a ‘70s rock studio, and an ‘80s horror movie ouija board party already during the season. This constant shift between style and period influences is similar to how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-netflix-mcu-1851173236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-netflix-mcu-1851173236"><em>WandaVision</em></a></span> regularly switched between different eras of television due to Wanda’s constant messing with reality in Westview when grieving the death of Vision and attempting to keep him alive in a world of her own creation. Since we don’t know the true extent of Billy’s powers, this could be an unintentional result of his overwhelming desire to complete the Witches’ Road, even going as far as making it into a reality in the first place. </p><p>With three episodes left in the series, there’s no telling if <em>Agatha All Along</em> is going down this road with its story. What is clear, however, is that the show will keep fans guessing until the very end.</p><p>. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Since this is a Sonic review I’ll go fast and cut to the chase: Sonic X Shadow Generations is a fantastic combination of one of the Blue Blur's classics and a new helping of smartly designed Shadow levels built around his own abilities, and after spending some time with it has become one of my favorite Sonic games I've ever played. Sega and Sonic Team have learned from their recent attempts, Frontiers and Superstars, and have found clever ways to weave the best ideas of those games into a major refresh of a fan favorite. And certainly, when it comes to Shadow the Hedgehog, this is his definitive game. </p><p>Half of the content of Sonic X Shadow Generations is remastered from 2011’s Sonic Generations, which we gave an 8.5 In our<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/28/sonic-generations-review"> <u>review</u></a> back then. It does have a few new bells and whistles, like the adorable Chao hidden in each 2D and 3D stages, but other than their level designs are mostly unchanged because they hold up just fine. I'd like to imagine that the Chao are a hint that we’ll see the return of the Chao Garden from Sonic Adventure 2 in a future Sonic game, but for now they’re just a nice homage.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generations Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If you never played the original, it’s definitely worth experiencing it for the first time here: Sonic Generations is a stellar combination of 2D and 3D gameplay that celebrated what was at the time a 20-year history by curating and recreating some of the best and most iconic Sonic levels that had come before. Shadow Generations wastes no time showcasing its creativity with multiple stand-out moments. The very first stage, or instance, transforms into fractals and looks like the alternate dimensions we've seen in Dr. Strange or Spider-Man: No Way Home. <br>
</p><p>The levels from Sonic Generations also get a slight but noticeable graphical boost thanks to the current generation of consoles: environments look more polished and the colors are more vibrant, making enemies, hazards, and springs just a bit more noticeable when you’re moving at high speed. So by default this is the best way to play it, even if the difference isn’t night and day. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is the best way to play Generations, even if the difference isn’t night and day.</p></div><p>However, the real reason you’d want to play Sonic X Shadow Generations is the all-new campaign filled with creative reimaginings of Shadow’s stages from his past appearances throughout the Sonic series. Shadow's five-hour campaign is separate from the Generations storyline but plays out in a similar way, in that each stage has one part in 2D and another in 3D. Shadow’s stages have all the fast-paced appeal you’d expect to get when playing as Sonic, similar to when new paths open up when replaying a stage after Sonic has gained the light dash ability. Shadow starts with a similar skill called the Chaos Dash, and then goes on to open up even more pathways when returning to stages with abilities like the Doom Wings that let you fly short distances and skip whole sections of levels, making them play very differently. </p><p>Shadow’s Chaos Control ability also creates fantastic moments where he does things like freeze time to destroy a missile flying at him in a flashy mini cutscene. And, unlike in the 2D Sonic stages that play like classic Sonic with no homing attack or boost gauge, Shadow keeps all his abilities for his 2D sections so they feel just as fast as his 3D stages. </p><div data-cy="poll-view-trigger"><form action="#"><fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="poll-question"><legend><p><h2 id="poll-question">What Generation of Sonic Games is your Favorite?</h2></p></legend><div><p><label for="answerId47708" id="answerId47708-label"><span>SEGA (Sonic 1-3 &amp; Knuckles)</span></label></p></div><div><p><label for="answerId47709" id="answerId47709-label"><span>Sega Saturn (Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic R, Sonic Jam)</span></label></p></div><div><p><label for="answerId47710" id="answerId47710-label"><span>Dreamcast/PS2/GC/Xbox (Sonic Heroes, Adventure 1 &amp; 2, Riders)</span></label></p></div><div><p><label for="answerId47711" id="answerId47711-label"><span>PSP/GBA/DS (Sonic Rivals, Rush, Advance, Chronicles)</span></label></p></div><div><p><label for="answerId47712" id="answerId47712-label"><span>Wii/PS3/360 (Sonic 06, Unleashed, Secret Rings, Colors, Generations)</span></label></p></div><div><p><label for="answerId47713" id="answerId47713-label"><span>PS4/Xbox One/Wii U (Sonic Mania, Boom, Lost World, Forces)</span></label></p></div><div><p><label for="answerId47714" id="answerId47714-label"><span>PS5/Xbox Series, Switch ( Sonic Frontiers, Superstars, X Shadow Generations)</span></label></p></div></fieldset></form></div><p>Besides the main stages there are various challenge stages with objectives like requiring you to destroy enough targets before reaching the goal, or finish a hazard-filled level with a single ring to unlock bosses and the next set of stages. It’s similar to Sonic Generations, with the main difference being that you need to complete all of the challenges to acquire the keys you need, instead of just one. I do miss the collecting of the Chaos Emeralds you get in Sonic Generations, because some of them had fun rival boss battles against characters like Metal Sonic and Silver, but since Sonic is collecting them in his portion of the story it wouldn’t make much sense for Shadow to be collecting them at the same time in his.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With both campaigns combined, the total number of stages is now over 150.</p></div><p>With both campaigns combined, the total number of stages is now over 150, including traditional, challenge, and boss stages. That would take even an avid Sonic fan about 15 to 20 hours to burn through. And for those looking for even more challenges, completing the Shadow campaign will unlock a new option that increases the difficulty of bosses and challenge levels when replaying them.</p><p>Though minimal, there are some new storylines that creatively weave between games where Shadow has appeared, tying them into big moments we've seen in past games, like Sonic and Shadow's duel in Sonic Adventure 2. There is also a healthy dose of new scenes filling in Shadow's past that reunite him with friends and foes, and offer more context to his storylines in games like Shadow the Hedgehog and Sonic Adventure 2. These moments ranged from fascinating to kickass, and they always left me wanting more. </p><p>Like Sonic’s, Shadow's is made up of fun reimaginations of some of his best stages across past Sonic games. We’ve got new versions of levels like Radical Highway, Rail Canyon, and the Space Colony Ark, and each stage is packed to the brim with creative routes that make good use of Shadow's old and new abilities.</p><p>He begins with his iconic Chaos Control ability, which stops time (including the stage timer) and allows you to outrun hazards like a runaway train, stop groups of enemies in their tracks so you can dispatch them with ease, or use the new Chaos Dash to reach strategically placed shortcuts.</p><p>From there, you unlock Doom abilities that give you new options for movement and combat. Without going into spoiler territory, one of my favorites that you get about midway through his story is Doom Surf. This power makes water levels a lot more fun by giving you a shadowy manta ray that can spin-attack through enemies and objects. These abilities are handed out after finishing a group of stages or an area’s boss, and they come at a fast enough pace to keep things consistently interesting and different from what came before. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom Surf makes water levels a lot more fun.</p></div><p>There are also some creative and enjoyable new versions of boss fights, like a metallic dragon that has you chasing him on the water, knocking trash into him, and charging up so you can unleash Chaos Control and land some real damage with a homing attack. I wish there were more of those, but those that are here make excellent use of the most recent Doom abilities and are all fantastic additions to the collection of egg robots and various other bosses from Sonic history.</p><p>In fact, the only stage that broke my momentum and reminded me of the missteps of modern Sonic games was the Sonic Frontiers 3D stage. It feels empty compared to most of Sonic X Shadow Generations and had an overreliance on a new sludge-based upgrade for Shadow that reminded me of one of my least favorite Wisp powers from Sonic Colors. Other than that, though, I enjoyed replaying every stage to find optimal paths, gather collectible keys to unlock secrets in the hub world, and improve my runs until I earned the coveted S-rankings. </p><p>Sonic X Shadow Generations also evolves the all-white hub world of Sonic Generations by taking it from a 2D plane to a three-dimensional one that expands outwards as you complete all the stages in a section and its accompanying boss. In between stages, I'd spend some time exploring the hub world to see what chests I could open using the keys I'd collected, as well as completing various optional activities like collecting 100 rings in a short amount of time to unlock multiple rewards like artwork, music, or journal entries about characters and the events of Shadow's life.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Jada's Gotta Go Fast Playlist</h3><p>Jada's Favorite Sonic Games Ranked</p></div><p>Similar to his blue counterpart, Shadow also has stages that are entirely locked to the old-school 2D perspective, and they feel right at home as he races his way to the goal. Besides a McDonalds toy called the Shadow Grinder from 2003 and a DLC stage in Sonic Forces: Episode Shadow, this is the first time we've gotten multiple full-2D Shadow levels, and it was interesting to see how his expanded move set impacted their designs. Abilities like Chaos Spears allowed me to hit switches from a distance to open up alternate paths, while Doom Surf meant no longer having to deal with those underwater sections of Sonic games that a lot of people don’t enjoy – you can just surf right on top of the water until reaching land. </p><p>Finally, I have to call out that the music accompanying our favorite hedgehogs as they race to the goal line is excellent, the guitar riffs for stages like Radical Highway and Space Colony Ark return, and are joined by some fantastic tracks like Crush 40's All Hail Shadow and Sonic Heroes Rail Canyon theme. One of my favorite elements of the Generations games is the selectable background music for every stage and challenge, so if you only want to hear Live &amp; Learn across every stage like the Crush 40 sicko you are, you can do that! The only catch is that you have to find some music tracks in chests scattered across the Shadow’s hub world or by collecting the musical notes and Red rings in Sonics to unlock them, but that’s a price I’m willing to pay.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Sonic X Shadow Generations takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights at a blistering pace by doubling up the campaign length with creative level design, fantastic bosses, plenty of collectibles, and an appreciable graphical upgrade. While the brand-new Shadow content isn't necessarily long on its own, it adds a nice change of pace to the collection of all-time great Sonic stages Generations already contained, and there’s an exciting new story that’s filled in as you explore the overworld for collectibles, activities, and challenges. This bulked-up remaster soars far and above previous enhanced versions we've gotten in the Sonic franchise, and hopefully will be the gold standard Sega holds itself to when it decides to bring back other Sonic games from the past. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Stunning arrays of spells, explosions, and more can evoke visceral emotion and tactility in a digital landscape. Under the hood these real-time visual effects refer to a wide umbrella of techniques and methods, ranging from particle systems to shaders to volumetrics, all used to produce these visual standards in service of a player experience. Beyond the spectacle, VFX in games can be leveraged as design tools themselves. Design-facing VFX illustrate mechanical concepts and offer clarity to players while visually integrating these ideas into greater tactile narratives or play. If authored with intentionality and purpose, VFX can become an essential part of any game’s design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My name is Antonio Gil and I’m a Senior VFX Artist. Previously I have worked at studios like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Naughty Dog</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Santa Monica Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>343 Industries</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Prior to my specialization in VFX, I also worked in a wide array of design-adjacent roles at an indie studio called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fair Play Labs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of my work has revolved around direct gameplay VFX, with a heavy focus on combat and interactable modules. In this article, I’ll be offering a few methods and considerations when addressing VFX with a design-facing mentality. I do want to note that by nature, the art field is not prescriptive in approach, and every videogame has its own contextual needs and goals. This article instead builds from my own familiarity and experience with both game design and game VFX to offer one particular lens with which to analyze design-facing VFX, and I will specifically be citing firsthand examples from my work supporting design through VFX on projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Tools in Your Kit: Design Elements to Leverage"><span>The Tools in Your Kit: Design Elements to Leverage</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VFX can be understood as a toolkit from which to pull from to achieve game design and artistic goals: effects can visually support design concepts, convey states, confirm actions, and much more. This can be driven by individual visual elements, such as particle emitters/spawners, animated pixel shaders, and particle cards (particles represented by simple four-sided polygons with textures).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a time-based visual art, VFX also inherits many concepts from other visual disciplines like graphic design and animation. That said, I will be acknowledging a just few elements and principles that I leverage most frequently when communicating design ideas through VFX. These concepts are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>shape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>color</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>timing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>scale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>contrast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>diegesis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For foundational knowledge on visual and motion design principles, I would also recommend frameworks like the Elements and Principles of Design, as well as the 12 Principles of Animation as essential subjects for further reading beyond this article.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="SHAPE"><span>SHAPE</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the context of game VFX, an effect’s shape can often be amongst the most readily perceivable attributes. Shape and profile can be clear identifiers, allowing players to recognize and associate the certain effects with particular cues. In the context of a sandbox multiplayer First-Person Shooter like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a VFX’s shape is used help players recognize individual weapons. Weapons in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> all exhibit different traits and behaviors, such as damage, firing speed, and projectile properties. As such, muzzle flashes are authored with the intention of being readily identifiable by their different shape profiles. Even with similar color palettes, weapons like the MA40 AR, BR75, and M50 Sidekick all have distinct muzzle flash shapes that make them uniquely identifiable.</span></p><p>From left to right: M50 Sidekick, BR75, and MA40 AR Muzzle Effects</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s crucial for players to recognize what kind of weapon is firing at them from long distances, even if the weapon itself is too far to be visibly identifiable. This allows players to adjust their moment-to-moment decision-making through the visual feedback of each weapon’s distinct muzzle flash.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, shape language can also be used to suggest directionality. Muzzle flashes in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have long, forward muzzle breaks to illustrate where an attacking player is firing towards, providing essential information for players in a multiplayer setting.</span></p><p>3rd Person View of the BR75 firing. Note the distinct forward shape when seen from the side.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shapes can also assist in determining the direction of projectiles or other moving objects. In many FPS games, projectiles have trails to help indicate how they travel through space. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showcases this clearly through the Needler’s slow-moving projectiles and the CQS48 Bulldog’s spread bullet tracers.</span></p><p>The CQS48 Bulldog and Needler both have tracer trails to illustrate projectile movement.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shapes offer a myriad of expressions beyond these examples, like how radial lines can draw attention to subjects in the center, or how rounded shapes can help illustrate an area. Sometimes a lack of clear shape may be a worthwhile quality to leverage for ambiguous or omnidirectional elements. Complex shapes, although harder to discern at a quick glance, can also be useful to illustrate implied motion and texture. Keeping the nature of the design in mind can help inform the shape of the VFX. When authoring VFX, consider how shapes can underscore direction, area, or any other information for your players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="COLOR"><span>COLOR</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like shape, color can be a key component of an effect’s visual identity. An effect’s color can be among the first properties a player can recognize. Colors are not inherently prescriptive; there is no preordained canon that states that green must represent healing while red must represent damage. Even still, shared color palettes can be used to reinforce mechanic similarities through pattern repetition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">divides weapon behaviors into 4 primary elemental types: Plasma, Shock, Hardlight, and Kinetic (associated with bullet weapons or physical projectiles). Each of these elemental types exhibit some overarching properties. Kinetic weapons are weak against shields but strong against unshielded targets, while Shock weapons can cause EMP arcing to stun multiple enemies and disable vehicles. Each element signals an association through an overarching elemental color palette. For example, kinetic weaponry is associated with yellowish orange hues, while shock elemental damage leans towards a gradient of pale to deep blues.</span></p><p>All the shock elemental behavior on the Disruptor is unified by its color palette.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has status ailments that can be inflicted via elemental attacks. Among these are the Bifrost element, whose status effect causes follow up attacks to inflict massive damage, and the Hex element, whose status effect propagates other status ailments inflicted onto the hexed target to surrounding enemies via secondary elemental explosions. Although these two elements are visually identified through purple coloration, they are further distinguished by distinct hues and from unique color accents. Hex element is visually described through magenta with some black secondary accents. Meanwhile, Bifrost instead leans towards blue-ish indigo hues while also making use of chromatic rainbow accents. Both these rainbow color accents and the perceivable difference in reddish tones from indigo to pink help differentiate the Bifrost palette from the Hex element.</span></p><p>The above Einherjar Bifrost attack by Jose Canchola is distinct in palette from the Hex arrows on the right.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Color can serve as an identifier and helps to establish associations properties within a game’s world. Consider if there are any key overarching design elements that could benefit from association or distinction, and if the VFX can assist in separating or unifying them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="TIMING"><span>TIMING</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VFX can convey ideas or feelings about the nature of the effect’s motion itself through their timing and animation. An effect’s timing can be used to refer to multiple attributes of an effect’s animation. It can refer to the speed at which it plays, how long it lingers, how it eases, or even how it affects secondary elements during its motion. The timing and the properties of designed motion and animation are entire art forms themselves. For the purposes of this article, I’ll focus on a few small aspects of timing and their ties to design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fast motion can often imply activity or reactivity. Fast pulses, snappy expansion, sweeping motion can all suggest that the effect is having an immediate, tangible effect on the world. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s Fusion Coils showcase a few different examples of rapid motion to suggest information regarding the object’s state and an action. Each Fusion Coil is an explosive canister associated with one of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite’s </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">elemental types (being Plasma, Shock, Hardlight, and Kinetic). When Fusion Coils take a minor amount of damage, these begin to violently leak before triggering a large explosion. In the case of Kinetic Fusion Coils, these leaks rapidly emit a stream of particles that emulate jets of gas and fire. These reactions suggest that the asset is currently active and volatile through the prominent motion of the leak effects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main explosive motion, on the other hand, consists of multiple particle cards that scale over time along a logarithmic curve. By using a logarithmic curve, the particles will quickly grow large in a short period of time and then grow slowly over a longer period. This motion emulates the violent gas expansion and subsequent drag of the smoke. Additionally, the slower, lingering motion after the rapid expansion offers players enough time to register the final size of the fireball.</span></p><p>Explosive Fusion Coils exhibit violent jets before expanding into a volatile fireball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The timing of an effect’s motion can suggest many different attributes. It can imply that the effect is a single explosive expansion, that the effect is flickering on a timer, or that the effect lingers softly in space. Whether an effect is an impact, a slash, or a poisonous mist, consider the speed at which it animates and evaluate whether this speed is legible for your players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="SCALE"><span>SCALE</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a design context, an effect’s scale can be used to help supply information in multitude of different ways. Particle size for example can be used to define an area of influence, and larger particles can be used to make the effect more readable from a distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fusion Coils in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leverage VFX to depict their area of effect. These make use of multiple different particle types, mostly relying on large flashes, fireballs, and smoke to help define the implied damaging area of influence upon detonation.</span></p><p>The size of the Fusion Coil’s explosion particles help approximate the damaging area of effect.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An effect’s size can also be used to improve legibility from a distance. For example, to make Fast Travel Doors more readily identifiable in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the blue particulates that make up the archway element increase in size if the player is farther away. The distance based scaling on the particulates helps players notice the placement of Fast Travel Doors from afar without being overwhelmingly large up close.</span></p><p>As the player approaches the Fast Travel Door, the particulates get smaller.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is important to distinguish when to tune an effect’s scale relative to its size on screen versus its absolute size in the world. If the Fast Travel Doors’s particulates always remained the same size regardless of distance, players would lack a significant cue on whether the Fast Travel Door has already been activated, as these particulates would likely be visible at distances where the player is already close enough to identify the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversely, an effect’s size must also be considered to produce unobtrusive gameplay. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> muzzle flashes are authored so that they seldom overlap the player’s crosshair. This prevents a player’s own firing effect from significantly obscuring critical targets.</span></p><p>Most muzzle flashes, like the Mangler’s, are designed to not obstruct the player’s direct aim.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When authoring design facing effects, consider whether the size is essential to underlying a mechanic’s area of influence, and whether the size of an effect can be leveraged to support clarity in players’ decision making.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="CONTRAST"><span>CONTRAST</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In visual design, contrast is a design principle that describes the differing properties between separate elements. Visual contrast can occur in many different facets, such as scale, color, shape, and motion. In game VFX, contrast can be leveraged to provide distinct visual complexity between different parts of an effect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VFX themselves can be used to highlight gameplay relevant mechanics or objects by contrasting the static background. VFX supporting core mechanics should often be unambiguous in all settings. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Atreus can block attacks as a core combat mechanic, and his blocking state is represented through VFX with a magical shield. For this reason, Atreus’s shield is tuned to be readily visible in every combat environment, as it is a major component of delineating whether players are in a blocking state.</span></p><p>Atreus’s Shield, regardless of lighting, will always be clearly visible.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, an effect can contrast the environment to underscore that an interactable module is not a standard piece of environmental geometry. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes use of structures called Wisp Pillars that continuously spawn Wisp enemies while active. Players are incentivized to prioritize their destruction in combat scenarios. For this reason, Wisp Pillars exude a tall, beacon-like purple glow and smoke that makes them visibly distinct from the surrounding environment. This underlines that these pillars are separate elements from the standard environmental geometry, and helps players identify them as objects of interest.</span></p><p>The Wisp Pillars make use of VFX to distinguish themselves from the static environment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned before, the contrast between shape, color, and timing of VFX can allow for a distinguishable visual language to emerge. Using VFX to accentuate systemic contrasts can help in creating a natural recognition between the properties of interactive elements that beckon attention versus the static components of an environment. Consider whether an effect needs to be unambiguously distinct from the environment or other elements to convey an idea.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="DIEGESIS"><span>DIEGESIS</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Certain elements in games, like sound and UI, can be described as diegetic or non-diegetic. Diegetic elements exist within the game world and are a direct part of the narrative fiction, such as characters hearing in-game footsteps. Conversely, non-diagetic elements are implied to exist outside of the direct space of the game’s immersive fiction and are not recognized within the game world, like as button prompts or pause menu sounds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game VFX can also be diegetic or non-diagetic. For example, in-universe magic would be considered a diegetic effect, while damage number particles in RPGs would be considered non-diegetic effects. Both diegetic and non-diegetic effects can be leveraged to convey information to the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diegetic effects often express design ideas through a natural narrativized interpretation of both actions and states within the game world. One example is the flammable oil barrels in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The oil barrels create a flammable spill when broken that can be ignited by the player. Upon breaking, these oil barrels produce a large spray into the air and a stream that pools onto the ground. These individual effects express events by visually narrativizing a set behavior. If these barrels are filled to the brim with oil, would breaking them open cause a violent ejection? Would it cause the oil to spray? Assessments like this help refine the direction with which an effect is expressed as an element of the world.</span></p><p>All the VFX on the Svartalfheim Oil Barrels imply that the fluid exits within the game’s world.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diegetic properties can facilitate elegant in-world design solutions. One example of this are the sluices in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Sluices can carry water that the player can freeze and spill to solve puzzles. However, these sluices are often placed above the player, so players need a way to tell whether the sluice has water flowing through it, even if they can’t see the top of the sluice. For this reason, whitewater splashes and steam are visible far above the top of the sluice to support the design’s intent. These effects assist in providing direct player feedback while seamlessly integrating natural elements from the game’s fiction.</span></p><p>The steam and whitewater splashes on the top of the sluice lets the player know where the water is coursing, even when they cannot actively see the water’s surface.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Non-diegetic effects, on the other hand, can be useful to illustrate unambiguous concepts that don’t need to exist within the game’s fiction but can still be important to players.&nbsp; An example of this in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the parry timing effect authored by James Adkins. This effect, represented by a growing yellow circle on an attacking enemy, informs the player on the parry timing of a particular attack. This circle does not exist within the game’s fiction, and instead exists for the sole purpose of having a consistent, legible element that can inform the players on the parry timing of any enemy.</span></p><p>The parry timing effect on the enemy, created by James Adkins, is not implied to physically exist within the game world in the same way that Atreus’s shield does, but it still supplies essential information for the player to properly respond to gameplay.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Non-diegetic effects aren’t exclusively utilitarian and can still share stylistic trappings with the game’s overall art direction. A game’s suite of effects doesn’t need to be exclusively diegetic or non-diegetic, and context and artistic goals should be evaluated to determine whether a specific effect can benefit from being diegetic, non-diegetic, or even a mix of both. Consider whether design information would be best conveyed as part of an in-world concept or as a component that is there specifically for the player’s eyes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Design-facing VFX offer artists and designers several ways to impart information through shape, color, timing, size, contrast, and diegesis. VFX in design contexts are seldom prescriptive in approach, and artists must consider the artistic goals, design context, and overall mission of the project. Beyond the pragmatism of design, VFX are also artistically expressive in nature, and can display spectacular visuals that can accentuate emotion. Design-facing VFX don’t exist solely as cordoned instructional guides to players either: any effect can just as well enrich the world with artistic finesse while offering clarity or instruction. Game VFX extend far outside the toolkit I’ve shared here, and can encompass worlds worth of exploration for anyone with a curiosity for visual art, motion, and the player experience. As mentioned before, VFX are seldom prescriptive, so it is up to you to discover what works best for you.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Castlevania collaborations keep on coming! Having already made appearances in the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/v-rising">V Rising</a>, it's now <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> turn to meld minds with Konami's classic platform series; developer Poncle's acclaimed minimalist survival RPG is joining in on the Castlevania fun - while still somehow managing to remain doggedly vampire-free - with a massive new paid expansion launching on Halloween.
</p>
<p>
"The sun has set on Dracula's iconic castle once more," explains Poncle in a flourish of scene-setting for its new DLC, "and as the moon rises a hellish horde of murky Mudmen, ghastly ghosts, and frightening Fleamen take the stage as the battle of good and evil rages under the moonlight. Unleash an arsenal of new Vampire-vanquishing weapons upon these beasts and leave a trail of doom in your wake on your quest to rid the world of the unspeakable terror."
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania, as the new DLC is more specifically known, introduces over 20+ new characters, 40+ new weapons (eight of which are whips, if you were wondering), plus over 30 music tracks. And that's alongside what Poncle is calling the game's "biggest stage yet". Breaking things down a little further, the expansion's character roster includes the Belmonts (Simon, Richter, Trevor, and Sonia are all accounted for), alongside the Belnades, and other "amazing allies", from Shanoa to Eric Lecarde.

<p>
Weapon-wise, Ode to Castlevania's cavalcade of whips is accompanied by elemental spells inspired by the likes of Portrait of Ruin and Harmony of Dissonance, plus magical weapons including Alucard's sword, spear, and shield. There're also new projectiles - throwing javelins and iron balls are referenced - alongside a selection of glyphs, with Confodere, Vol Confodere, and Melio Confodere all being namechecked in today's announcement.
</p><p>
Music, meanwhile, includes "several dozen" original tracks from across the Castlevania series, plus a "ridiculous amount" of remixes. And if you're wondering about the map, it does, of course, whisk players to Dracula's castle, where they'll encounter "sinister secrets and a bunch of baneful bosses" - but, crucially, no vampires.
</p>
<p>
So how much will all this Castlevania-flavoured fare cost you when Vampire Survivors' latest expansion launches for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210350/Vampire_Survivors_Ode_to_Castlevania/">Steam</a>, and mobile on 31st October? Well, it's a bit of a bargain, weighing in at just £2.99/€3.99/$3.99.

While Oz and Vic work to steal back the psychoactive mushroom drug they want to start flipping on the street, Sofia has to convince a bunch of men that she’s innocent (of killing her family, which she’s not) and capable (of running her family, which she is). After deftly handling Gotham chief of police Mackenzie Bock (Con O’Neill, reprising his role from <em>The Batman</em>), who’s shown up to “investigate” (read: gloat about) the mysterious death of her entire family, it’s revealed that Sofia is keeping Johnny Viti (Michael Kelly) in the Falcone family catacombs, dumping cold water on his nearly naked body as a form of torture in an attempt to get him to hand over the wads of unmarked cash her father squirreled away.</p><p>And she gets her money (torture works!), but she’s not keeping it to herself. Sofia Falcone (now Sofia Gigante, as she decides to take her mother’s maiden name to honor her memory and distance herself from her father) wants to run a more egalitarian famiglia, a socialist-leaning mob, if you will. She wants to end this pointless war between the Falcone family and the Marone clan, which used these men as disposable chess pieces while the capos sat in their mansions getting richer and fatter. She wants to share the wealth—literally.<br></p><p>Sofia gathers all the men to explain her new business model and present a huge bag of money, which she slams on the table to show them this is what the dons hoarded while they worked and bled for them. Viti begins to protest, talking over Sofia while she’s mid-rant—so she shoots him in the head. As his blood spreads across the table, she upends the bag of money onto it after promising that, going forward, they will have more money than they know what to do with, that they will share what they earn.<br></p><p>“Go ahead,” she says sardonically as one man reaches for a wad of cash. They all collapse upon the pile, snatching as much as they can carry. This is an equitable distribution of wealth in a mafia business model. Welcome to socialism, Gotham.<br></p><p>It’s fascinating that both Oz and Sofia champion the same ideals but employ wildly different methods to try and shift Gotham’s criminal enterprises toward fairness. In this episode, Oz reminds his crew that they always eat when he eats, while Sofia points out that the Falcone henchmen were never “made men,” they were never given an equal piece of the pie. But Sofia knows that she’ll have to cater to men’s precarious egos while ensuring her power never falters, so she moves through negotiations with purpose and elegance. She is a scalpel, while Oz is a bulldozer, destroying everything in his path to ensure he can rise through the ranks and become king of Gotham.<br></p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how their very different approaches play out throughout the rest of the season. The next episode of <em>The Penguin</em> airs on Sunday, October 27 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO Max.<br></p><hr><p><strong>Check out more <em>The Penguin </em>content:</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-sofia-falcone-cristin-milioti-cast-1851673041?_gl=1*vc8jnb*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTUyMzExNS4yNTQuMS4xNzI5NTI0MDE4LjM5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-sofia-falcone-cristin-milioti-cast-1851673041?_gl=1*vc8jnb*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTUyMzExNS4yNTQuMS4xNzI5NTI0MDE4LjM5LjAuMA.."><em>The Penguin</em> Is About Sofia Falcone, Actually</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/author/alyssamercante?/alyssamercante&amp;_gl=1*vc8jnb*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTUyMzExNS4yNTQuMS4xNzI5NTI0MDE4LjM5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/author/alyssamercante?/alyssamercante&amp;_gl=1*vc8jnb*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTUyMzExNS4yNTQuMS4xNzI5NTI0MDE4LjM5LjAuMA.."><em>The Penguin</em> Is The Funniest Show On TV Right Now</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226">The First Episode Of <em>The Penguin</em> Is Colin Farrell At His Best</a></span></li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game sort of seems like a Minecraft MMO, in which players farm resources and build on a big shared planet.</p><p dir="ltr">Beacons reportedly seem like an important commodity. Once put down on the planet, only players who placed them can edit or build within that area. It's recommended that players stash their special items within their beacon zones. Outside of these areas, everyone can edit stuff and take on enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also reportedly be a social area called the Dev Core, where it seems like things are more laid back to chill with people. It's noted this is where players must go to level up their characters, as well. The leveling system revolves around placing and developing beacons.</p><p dir="ltr">There is still no name associated with the experience, though it appears to be a brand-new IP. Visually, from screenshots, the project might resemble Pushmo from a Nintendo perspective. It's also unknown what developer is behind this game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-celebrates-3rd-birthday-with-teaser-for-new-stuff/1100-6527159/" data-ref-id="1100-6527159">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack just recently turned three years old and teased that new stuff</a> is on the way for the premium subscription.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> will fully utilize the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware to enhance the experience further and finally offer a ray tracing option on console.</p>
<p>The game's Quality and Performance modes in the game are both improved on the PS5 Pro, taking full advantage of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler to deliver better visuals and performance. Quality mode will offer 30 FPS gameplay with ray tracing and ray-traced reflections (opaque and transparent) with an internal resolution of 2176 x 1224 upscaled to 4K.</p>
<p>Performance mode, on the other hand, will sport significantly higher output resolution and more visual detail compared to the base PS5, offering better image stability, fog, volumetric lighting, and shadow accuracy. In this display mode, Alan Wake 2 will run at 60 frames per second with an internal resolution of 1536 x 864 upscaled to 4K, a much higher output than the base model's 1440p.</p>
<p>To better show how Alan Wake 2 is improved on PlayStation 5 Pro, Remedy Entertainment shared a couple&nbsp;<span>of early comparison videos, which can be found below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-teraleak-online-co-op-battler<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Teraleak just keeps on going, and now, an upcoming game based around online co-op&nbsp;Pokemon battling has seemingly been leaked, although whether it's still in active development or not is unclear.</p>
<p>Per&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848370639544914190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centro Leaks on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, data has been uncovered concerning something with the project codename "Rodeo", although Centro also points out that the name appears to have been changed to "Synapse" at some point during development.</p>
<p>According to Centro, the game revolves around the <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369217336488065" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concept of riding Pokemon</a>&nbsp;(hence Rodeo, I suppose); players have a Pokemon to ride, then throw out Pokeballs containing other Pokemon to do battle from atop their Poke-steed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-scarvi-starters.jpg?itok=gb3y7F7D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-scarvi-starters.jpg?itok=TcIevaxe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new co-op&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game appears to be in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369678000791637" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concept art shot</a> from the game depicts a player riding a Garchomp, and <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848370639544914190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup videos</a> also posted by Centro show players riding the likes of Electivire, Samurott, and Decidueye, so it looks like a wide range of Pokemon will be available as steeds.</p>
<p>According to Centro, the unnamed online co-op&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game will also feature <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369840853004637" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mechanisms</a> that look rather similar to guns, although they're not quite as explicitly lethal as those you might see in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to customize your mount Pokemon with <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369999963926921" rel="noopener" target="_blank">different markings</a>, Centro says, and <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848370152389169227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two protagonists</a> will be available, one male and one female.</p>
<p>Gameplay footage posted by Centro shows a Geodude using a ground-based attack and also throwing up a shield around its trainer, as well as a Piplup surfing a wave and using a bubble-based attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-unite.jpg?itok=D4h_G9qZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-unite.jpg?itok=D-XR8OII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>, this mysterious&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>co-op game appears to be based around co-op play, although whether it's competitive or not is unclear.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the premise appears to show players both using gun-like weapons and riding Pokemon, this might shed some light on why Nintendo has pursued&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair so aggressively for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, since Synapse-slash-Rodeo hasn't officially been announced yet, we don't know if it'll ever see the light of day as an official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>project, but what Centro has shown looks pretty definitive, so we may well get an official announcement in future.</p>
<p>This is all part of what's being referred to as the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Teraleak, a leak in which tons of data relating to past, present, and future&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-freak-pokemon-hack-confirmed">was revealed online</a>. As you can see, the data from that leak is still coming, so we'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <p>If you're fondly dreaming of an actual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> 2, not some half-and-half OLED travesty, you should also be fondly dreaming of a better class of battery. Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.</p> <!--more-->
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence," Yang told <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">Reviews.org</a> in an interview to mark the handheld PC's release in Australia. "We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better. So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we're excited about and we're working on."</p>
<p>The aforesaid Steam Deck OLED, the pair added, was more of a question of Valve adding features they wish they'd been able to implement for the original Steam Deck. "What we said when we launched the OLED was that this is not a second-generation device," added Yang. "This is what we would say is what we wish we had shipped originally for Steam Deck [LCD], and I think that has been borne out." </p>
<p>There are still a few things they'd like to add to the current generation of Steam Deck handhelds. Asked about the competing ROG Ally X's variable refresh rate display, Aldehayyat acknowledged that "VRR is a thing that we've been asked a lot about and I can say that we also wanted it really badly for the OLED ones. We just couldn't get it done on time. So that's probably a feature that is on the top of our list of things that we would like to do." And then there's the apparently decisive question of battery. "The battery life on Steam Deck, I think there's a general consensus that's the best in its class, but I would really love to have it be better," said Aldehayyat.</p><p>If I were hardware editor James Archer, I'd probably have a clever insight at this point about, say, the differing battery capacities of Steam Deck and its competitors, trends in battery tech at large, and the energy footprints and efficiencies of the next generation of processors. Here's his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED review</a> for context, in which he notes that "nothing about the Steam Deck OLED has as fundamental an impact on its day-to-day doings as the battery life upgrades."</p>
<p>The reason I, and not James Archer, am writing this news article is basically that I want to punish James for his fickle lending habits. You see, James very kindly let me borrow one of his own Steam Decks, a few months ago, then very unkindly - viciously, you could argue - asked to have it back again, so that he could "test" something or other.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many Steam Decks James owns, but I hear he sleeps on a huge pile of them, like a dragon. Me, I have to sleep on a cold, hard bed of bricked Acer netbooks. Still, perhaps when the "real" Steam Deck 2 does roll around James will find it in him to part with one of the spare OLEDs he otherwise uses to light his cigars. In the meantime, I will be passive-aggressively pinching the odd nugget of hardware news and proudly displaying my ignorance. I don't even know what "variable refresh rate" means. I assumed they'd just spelt VR wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This primary weapon replacement — a huge shield that lets you deflect bullets from enemy weapons — has sparked as much frustration as it has devilish delight, with critics claiming the riot shield encourages frustrating turtle tactics that are hard to counter, and fans saying, essentially, get good.</p><p>Over the last few Call of Duty games, the riot shield has met with consistent calls for it to be either nerfed or pulled from the game. It’s a particular favorite of the Modern Warfare sub-brand, appearing in last year’s Modern Warfare 3, 2022’s Modern Warfare 2, and 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. Black Ops developer Treyarch, however, isn't a fan; the only Treyarch game to have a riot shield as a weapon was 2012’s Black Ops 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/21/mwiii-preseason-04-005-1729517952017.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Modern Warfare 3's riot shield in action.

Lo and behold, it is nowhere to be found; cue rapturous applause from (most) fans who are now looking forward to straight up gun fights in their gun game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing the full Black Ops 6 weapon list without a Riot Shield on it... <a href="https://t.co/XMHznKUOXL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XMHznKUOXL</a></p>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1848060374186082398?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s this thing called shooting your gun.

In truth, the riot shield and its slower, more defensive gameplay probably wasn’t the best fit for the fast-paced Black Ops 6 and its new Omnimovement mechanic anyway.</p><p>We’re nearing the October 25 release date for Black Ops 6 and so we have plenty of information on what to expect.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks-and-it-looks-pretty-weird.1015242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The mysterious Nintendo Switch Online playtest announced a couple of weeks ago has leaked, because of course it has, and the feature that it appears to be heralding is...well, it's pretty odd, to say the least.</p>
<p>Said playtest was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest">first announced on October 10th</a>, and although Nintendo gave nothing away, speculation was rife. Was this the introduction of GameCube games to Switch Online? A new game altogether? Some kind of secret, heretofore-unknown DLC?</p>
<p>Within minutes of Nintendo announcing the playtest, the company revealed that signups were full, and with so many people taking part, the content of the playtest was bound to leak sooner or later. Lo and behold, that's exactly what's happened.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-mario.jpg?itok=t0IlD45d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-mario.jpg?itok=mYvE34vy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest has leaked, and it's probably about as odd as you'd expect from Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>Before long, enterprising playtesters had <a href="https://x.com/Aro75615955/status/1848223364143354236" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaked the page</a> shown to them by Nintendo for the playtest, and another leaker <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1kfClf9A9jQnsHN6v91dZ7RVbUvpB1fGzG0ew0KLy7B8/mobilebasic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">compiled a Google Doc</a>&nbsp;that showed off everything in the playtest in detail.</p>
<p>In short, the leaks appear to show a game in which you must develop a planet by "utilizing creativity and farmed resources". Nintendo's stated aim with the playtest is to "test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay on our servers".</p>
<p>As you play this new game, you'll gain Beacons, which you can place within your Planetary Block. Within your Beacon, you can "move, lift, [and] edit items", and outside player Beacons, anyone can build.</p>
<p>You'll socialize with other players within an area called the Dev Core, which is also where you'll level up your character, get new items, and more. The test looks like it's showing off a game that's somewhere between&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>, and a shared open-world MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer">like&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-worlds-adrift.jpg?itok=uWtaOc5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-worlds-adrift.jpg?itok=x-s0gP6u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest game is somewhat similar to games like&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>by Bossa Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The eventual goal is for all players to create their own planet together, and said planet will seemingly be a mixture of player-created Beacons and communally-created spaces outside the Beacons.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether this game will eventually see the light of day for the general public or whether it's intended solely as a way for Nintendo to test its server infrastructure, but it seems like a pretty typically Nintendo idea to me. We'll bring you more on this as we get it.</p>

The newly announced downloadable content for the auto-shooter survival game, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3210350%2FVampire_Survivors_Ode_to_Castlevania%2F"><em>Ode to Castlevania</em></a>, promises a bunch of new stuff: 20 characters, 40 weapons, an extra-large stage, and over 30 music tracks. Developer Poncle said in its <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1848320054984585315">announcement post on X</a> that the $3.99 expansion should contain more than 10 hours worth of gameplay — though it’s not clear if there will actually be any vampires in the game (I’m still betting there won’t be).</p><p>The new <em>Vampire Survivors</em> DLC is set to launch on October 31st on the PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, Android, and iOS. You can also track its release with a cheesy, ‘90s-era <a href="https://afiolnjvs89y309s90zg.poncle.games/">countdown timer site</a> set up by the developer. (Mind your speaker volume before visiting, as it auto-plays a short loop of some of the sick new music.)</p><div><figcaption><em>That’s a lot of Belmonts and friends.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Poncle</cite></p></div><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> first came out in 2021 with <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired sprite art the developer purchased from an asset pack, but now the game is coming full circle with a Konami collaboration. Konami seems to love licensing its franchises in recent years, as <em>Vampire Survivors</em> had a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2887680%2FVampire_Survivors_Operation_Guns%2F"><em>Contra</em>-themed collaboration</a> earlier this year, and the Castlevania franchise was used in Evil Empire’s critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23634280/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-expansion-dlc-start-playing"><em>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</em></a> expansion.</p><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> has consistently received free and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990848/vampire-survivors-is-getting-among-us-themed-dlc">paid updates</a> for years now, and the game has swelled with new characters, stages, achievements, unlockables, and new modes like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23832998/vampire-survivors-co-op-nintendo-switch">local co-op</a>. The game has consistently been on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed%2Fpastmonth">Steam Deck most played charts</a> since Valve began tracking the games soaking up the most playtime on its handheld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
