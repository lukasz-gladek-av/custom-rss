Following the reveal of the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards 2024 last week, the studio confirmed that the character’s previous actor,  Jo Wyatt, has been replaced by Ciara Berkeley.

She was still a young person growing up throughout her journey, with the 2015 blockbuster serving as a sort of coming-of-age tale for her. </p><p>In <em>The Witcher 4</em> trailer, Ciri’s tone is much less innocent, hopeful, and enthusiastic. Now a veteran monster slayer in her own right, she sounds hardened by the cruel world around her and the burden of constantly making the “lesser of two evil” trade-offs that the games and the Polish fantasy novels they’re adapted from are known for. Berkeley performs the role well, though I’ll miss Wyatt for sure. </p><p>Geralt, on the other hand, who is voiced by Doug Cockle across the existing <em>Witcher</em> trilogy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-geralt-ciri-open-world-rpg-trailer-voice-date-1851720593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-geralt-ciri-open-world-rpg-trailer-voice-date-1851720593">will return in some form</a></span> with the same actor at the helm.

<p>Is there anything like returning to one of the most entertaining Assassin’s Creed titles to date? Black Flag was the epitome of the franchise for many, and it’s what most wanted from Skull &amp; Bones, but alas, Black Flag remains in the past. Or so we thought. As it turns out, Ubisoft is working hard to make its back catalog viable, with brand-new Steam achievements in Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag available now!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-steam-achievement-in-assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag">Every Steam Achievement in Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag</h2>



<p>Ubisoft introduced 60 Steam Achievements to Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag on December 16, alongside achievements for Ghost Recon Wildlands and Assassin’s Creed Unity. It’s a long-requested feature that folks have spent countless hours clamoring for in the Steam Discussions boards, and it’s finally happening. </p>



<p>Most of the game’s achievements revolve around the primary campaign and side content, but a few are for the expansion, Freedom Cry.</p>

			<p>Dead Island 2 was one of those games that fans had lost all hopes of being able to play due to all the trouble it went through. Originally, the game was developed by Yager Development, and I even got to play a preview build at Gamescom 2014. Not long after that, however, publisher Deep Silver announced the removal of Yager, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by British studio Sumo Digital. Three and a half years later, the same happened once again when&nbsp;<span>Deep Silver's own Dambuster Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> Sumo</span>.</p>
<p>At this point, it was unclear whether Dead Island 2 would ever launch and, if it did, in what condition. However, Dambuster surprised many last year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivering a tight, fun experience</a> that resonated well enough with fans, having reached over ten million players to date (although some of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the Game Pass subscription service</a>). The game recently celebrated the launch of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game, both DLCs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-haus-a-crossbow-bolt-to-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HAUS</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-sola-a-festival-to-undie-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoLa</a>), and several weapons and skin packs.</p>
<p>But that's not all, as the developers also added a whole new Horde mode called Neighborhood Watch, a New Game Plus mode, and full PlayStation 5 Pro support for free. For this developer Q&amp;A, we focused on the latter, sending a few questions to Dambuster's Core Technology Director, Andrew Mitchell, to get more insights on the studio's experience with Sony's new mid-generation console. Keep scrolling below the embedded video to read it all.</p>

<p><strong>How long did it take for you to prepare the PS5 Pro update?</strong></p>
<p>Approximately one month spread between the Engineering and QA teams. Initially we needed to take an SDK update so that DI2 was 'Pro' compatible. Fortunately, we'd already put a lot of effort into making DI2 scalable across gen8 / gen9 and high-end pc, so we were able to leverage existing scalability options to tune DI2 optimally for PS5 Pro. After making various changes to the Pro build, we then ran the game through both manual QA testing and our automated performance testing environment to ensure that the improved fidelity was realized without compromising a solid 60fps experience.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What is the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>The Pro offers a significant improvement over the base console, primarily in the domain of GPU performance. The improved GPU power was something that DI2 could really lean into because we were making a graphically demanding game.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>Both Pro models offer upgrades to CPU and GPU performance, but the main improvement is GPU, so they are similar in that these mid-gen updates can achieve higher visual fidelity which is a real plus for gamers. I'm sure the best is yet to come with respect to how new titles are able to leverage the power of PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of Dead Island 2?</strong></p>
<p>We were able to improve both the visual fidelity and increase the resolution for DI2 for the PS5 Pro. These quality improvements included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadows</li>
<li>Draw Distances</li>
<li>Contact Shadows on All Objects &amp; Lights</li>
<li>Motion Blur</li>
<li>Depth of Field</li>
<li>Texture Filtering</li>
</ul>
<p>For the resolution, we unlocked our dynamic resolution upper bound to be native 4K, and in the general case, the game was able to achieve this target.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)?</strong></p>
<p>No, we are not.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Does the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro has the same visual settings as the 'High' spec on PC. We do offer an 'Ultra' spec mode on PC, which pushes beyond that, however. When considering the upgrade options for Pro, we wanted to ensure that we didn't compromise the solid 60fps frame rate target which gives users the best game experience.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

With viewing figures obfuscated or entirely hidden, and streamers’ mercurial decisions rarely explained, a new favorite show—that seems to be unanimously popular—can just get canceled out of the blue. But worry not, <em>Silo</em> fans: the superb adaptation of Hugh Howey’s novels has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/hit-apple-tv-plus-show-silo-gets-renewed-for-two-final-seasons-to-tell-the-complete-story-of-hugh-howeys-sci-fi-book-series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/hit-apple-tv-plus-show-silo-gets-renewed-for-two-final-seasons-to-tell-the-complete-story-of-hugh-howeys-sci-fi-book-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially confirmed</a></span> for a full four-season run.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First self-published in 2011, Hugh Howey’s short story “Wool” became a word-of-mouth phenomenon. Eventually spawning three novels known as the Silo series, these are the basis for Apple’s <em>Silo</em>, the story of a post-apocalyptic society living in a colossal underground—well—silo. Written by <em>Justified</em>’s Graham Yost, and starring Rebecca Ferguson (<em>Dune</em>), David Oyelowo and Tim Robbins, its second season is currently being released weekly on Apple TV+, and damn, it’s so good.</p><p>While the timing might seem a little awkward given the similarity of <em>Silo</em>’s setting to <em>Fallout</em>’s post-disaster underground societies, the two shows play out very differently. While Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> adaptation has certainly given more attention to bunker life than the games usually do, <em>Silo</em> doesn’t afford anyone the option to go outside. Any who try are seen falling dead only moments after committing the heinous heresy of leaving the silo.</p><p>The result is utterly compelling, the complex nature of the hierarchical systems of the silo existing in conflict with the mysteries that lie behind its walls (and mirrors),  all oriented around Ferguson’s Juliette Nichols. She’s a mechanic, born high up but living down low, unable to escape the consequences of her parents’ actions, and unafraid of the blasphemy rules around owning “old tech,” essentially anything with a CPU.</p><p>I love it. Having read the short story so long ago, the show has offered the most extraordinary realization of the scenario, with stunning performances, beautiful direction, and the most incredible set design. Given recent trends, I’d normally know better than to get attached to such an excellent sci-fi show!</p><h2 id="h2112"><a id=""></a>It’s tough to be sci-fi</h2><p>It’s been a brutal couple of years for fantasy and sci-fi fans. Netflix cancelled <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, <em>Welcome to Eden</em>, <em>1899</em>, and <em>Kaos</em>, while Disney+ snuffed out <em>The Acolyte</em>, and Apple TV+ barely gave the adored <em>Time Bandits</em> a chance to shine, as well as killing off <em>Constellation</em>. Let alone <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, <em>Andor</em>, <em>Arcane</em>, <em>The Boys</em>, and <em>The Umbrella Academy </em>all coming to intended ends either now or next season. It’s becoming a real issue that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people just aren’t watching new streaming shows</a></span> because the chances of them getting canceled are so high, it’s not worth the emotional investment.</p><p>So it’s a real joy to learn that Apple has renewed <em>Silo</em>, not just for a third season  but for a fourth as well, with the intention that the show wrap up at that point. After all, by then it’ll have run out of books and short stories to adapt.</p><p>In Apple’s press release, the company quotes series creator Graham Yost explaining, “With the final two chapters of <em>Silo</em>, we can’t wait to give fans of the show an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the many mysteries and unanswered questions contained within the walls of these silos.” Which is another enormous relief, given how this isn’t a <em>Lost</em> or a <em>From</em>—not getting answers here, when they’re tangibly available to those in the know, would be agony. (Or you could read the books, I suppose.)</p><p>Ferguson, who not only does the vast amount of the show’s heavy lifting through her astonishing performance, is also a hands-on executive producer on the program. She adds, in rather unfortunate press-release-ese, “I have always felt passionately about telling the entire story contained within Hugh Howey’s books, so I couldn’t be happier that audiences around the world have enthusiastically embraced the show. I cannot wait to dive into these final two thought-provoking seasons that will beautifully conclude this dystopian tale.” </p><p>If you’ve access to the catacombs of Apple TV+, definitely give <em>Silo</em> a watch. It’s worth noting that as of the last month, Apple’s stuff can now be accessed via Amazon Prime in the U.S. and UK, making it a far less arcane streamer to find.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular games of the moment, is to receive a Christmas-themed event. The information was released today (16) by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1868702639585980656">NetEase Games</a>. The event starts on December 20th and will last until January 9th.</p>



<p>Called The Winter Celebration, the event will feature a new game mode focused on Jeff. Called Jeff’s Winter Splash Festival, the mode is very reminiscent of Splatoon, where the two teams have to use the shark to “paint” the map. The winner is whoever paints the largest part of the territory within a time limit.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Winter Celebration, Joyful Jubilation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be5Err7ygLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to this themed mode, the team will deliver new themed skins for Venom, Rocket, Jeff himself, Groot, and Magic. Jeff’s skin will be free in keeping with the good spirit of the time.</p>



<p>The team has also promised surprises, but no further details have been released. Despite the event being viewed favorably, players are making a series of demands on the game’s social networks. Among them are requests for a mode where players can select their hero’s category before the match, the possibility of voting on maps, and, of course, a better balance between the characters.</p>



<p>As Marvel Rivals has only just been released, the team will certainly need more time to work on these additional features. Even balancing takes time, after all, there are dozens of different characters.</p>

<p>It appears Ubisoft is genuinely committed to Steam, as they’ve announced not one but three classic titles on the platform will receive achievements. Alongside all of the Ghost Recon Wildlands achievements, you can also unlock Steam Achievements in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed Unity as of December 16. For now, let’s focus on the tactical shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-ghost-recon-wildlands-achievement-added-to-steam">Every Ghost Recon Wildlands Achievement Added to Steam</h2>



<p>In all, there are now <strong>57 Steam Achievements</strong> in Ghost Recon Wildlands, with the majority unlocking throughout the main campaign and side missions. There are, thankfully, a few specific to Fallen Ghosts and Operation Narco Road. You shouldn’t have much trouble achieving 100% in Wildlands, though!</p>

<p>Mafia: The Old Country, from developer Hangar 13 and publisher 2K Games, is the fourth mainline entry in the long-running Mafia series and a return to the game’s roots. Whereas the last game, Mafia 3, took a spin on the old-school mafia theme by following Lincoln Clay dismantling the Italian Mafia step-by-step, The Old Country brings the story back to its origins by focusing on Italy, where the Italian Mafia began. We’re still a ways off from release, though, and information about the potentially third-person action game remains scarce. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-mafia-the-old-country-release-date">When is the Mafia: The Old Country Release Date?</h2>



<p>Following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer leak</a> supposedly from The Game Awards, we now know that Mafia: The Old Country will launch in the summer of 2025. However, an exact release date is currently unavailable.</p>

<p>Of course, a teaser trailer is one thing, the actual trailer is way more impressive:</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 launched into Early Access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on December 6, and within less than two weeks (as of this writing), it skyrocketed to become one of the top three most-played titles on Steam. The ARPG is pushing serious numbers, outpacing Diablo IV’s recent expansion and surpassing Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Valve’s digital storefront. So, what kind of player numbers are we talking about for Path of Exile 2?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-does-path-of-exile-2-have">How Many Players Does Path of Exile 2 Have?</h2>



<p>On a Monday morning, before holiday vacations, as we explore Path of Exile 2’s significant player numbers, there are approximately <strong>370,000 active players</strong> in-game at the time of publication, and that’s just on Steam. That’s an absolutely staggering number of Witches, Mercenaries, and Monks grinding levels to defeat Count Geonor at the end of Act 1 or Jamanra, The Abomination, at the end of Act 2.</p>



<p>Of course, these numbers will fluctuate throughout the week and in the coming months, and we’ll likely see a massive influx of players next year when Path of Exile 2 inevitably launches as a free-to-play ARPG for everyone.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-all-time-peak-number-of-players-for-path-of-exile-2">What’s the All-Time Peak Number of Players for Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>While the current number of people playing Path of Exile 2 is impressive, the all-time peak, achieved on December 8, is jaw-dropping. On that day, the latest hit from developer Grinding Gear Games had a total of <strong>578,569</strong> players on Steam. We don’t have numbers for the GGG launcher, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, unfortunately.</p>



<p>Again, I fully expect the team to beat this number next year. As Path of Exile 2 progresses through Early Access, we’ll receive additional monsters, bosses, story acts, classes, and ascendancies to choose from. This very well could become the largest ARPG to date!</p>

		<p>The end of 2024 is nigh, which means we're crossing 18 months running <em>Remap</em>. <em>Waypoint</em> was the longest I'd ever been at the same job, and it was easy to track how long I'd been there because it was the same age as my oldest child. That  system broke when <em>Remap</em> started, because my oldest daughter is now eight years old, <em>Waypoint</em> lasted seven, and <em>Remap</em> is approaching an opportunity to be rounded up towards two. Strange times, but I remain eternally thankful for this situation, given how things are unfolding elsewhere. I've been hoping for some kind of bounce back in games media, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts?ref=remapradio.com">but...how, exactly?</a></p><p>-pk, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/i-like-my-suitcase-barron-trump/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">whose children were into the "I Like My Suitcase" meme</a> until I told my oldest that it was Donald Trump's son's voice in the video (something I was not initially aware of) and she told me to turn it off lol</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>After Dark</em> – We know that people have been asking for thoughts on what Old Waypoint thinks about New Waypoint, and as you've seen, we've been a little cautious.

Though our thoughts might land a little different than you might think. </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Infinity Nikki</em> – I've been curious about this one for a hot minute now. Whether to not I'll actually end up liking it remains to be seen, but I gotta know.

You'll hear this during the break.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Space Marine 2</em> – I don't know if we can finish the game, but we'll do our best to get as far as we can before the holiday season kicks off for us. (If we don't beat it on stream during this season, we'll do it in the new year.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Chance I'm sitting this one out due to the way we're going to shift recording schedules on this one, but remains to be seen.

Does such an eagerly awaited release live up to the hype? Is it full of anomalous bugs that mar the overall experience? Only the user reviews on Steam can provide such insights!</p><p>Of course, with so much strife pulling the development team in multiple directions, it would make sense that the open-world survival game felt half-baked to some, missing features to many, and downright buggy to most. That said, despite its flaws, there’s a genuinely exceptionally good time to be had in <em>Stalker 2</em>. But that’s just my opinion, and you’re here for everyone else’s!</p><p>On the positive side of the spectrum, the Steam user reviews for<em> Stalker 2</em> vary greatly, ranging from jokes and memes to declarations of undying support and love. More than a few user reviews claim this is the ultimate nostalgia trip back to childhood, while others can’t thank the team at GSC Game World enough for their work.</p><p>But it’s not all roses. On the negative review front, people claim it’s an excellent game but a terrible <em>Stalker </em>title. They point toward the lack of an A-Life system, initially announced for the game but didn’t make the cut, along with countless soft-locks, crashes, and game-breaking bugs.</p><p>Most agree that <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> required a little more time to cook, but what’s available now is surprisingly excellent despite its flaws. If you’re on the fence about the open-world survival game, then here’s your look at<em> Stalker 2</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="271d9e5b8fcc52dd0a79bf82d7836335"

Drawing on everything from the German Expressionist techniques of the 1922 classic <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em> to the grotesque transformation of Bill Skarsgård into the demented clown <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581">Pennywise</a></span> in the recent <em>It </em>films, Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> continues a storied horror legacy.</p><p>To fully appreciate the beauty behind the brutality of <em>Nosferatu</em> when it arrives in theaters on Christmas Day, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with its inspirations. The dreamlike visuals, the grayscale color palette that conveys a pervasive gloom, and the tight framing that creates an unsettling sense of confinement will all feel strikingly familiar if you explore these 12 must-watch films before immersing yourself in Eggers’ latest masterpiece.</p></div></div><div><p>An adaptation of the classic fairy tale, Jean Cocteau’s <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is set in the 18th century and features a visual style that feels both sumptuous and nightmarish. The decadent costumes resemble Lily-Rose Depp’s beautiful gowns in <em>Nosferatu</em>, with plumes of silk, flowing skirts, and tight bodices. The black-and-white cinematography has a sharp, surreal quality, illuminating the piercing whites of the Beast’s eyes. The monochrome visuals are so stark they seem dreamlike—note the scene set in a pitch-black hallway lit by tiny, twinkling lights from candelabras. Like <em>Nosferatu</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is a monster movie that is beautiful to look at, even in all its darkness.</p></div><div><p>Before seeing <em>Nosferatu</em>, you should brush up on the origins of German Expressionism, as these filmmaking techniques are still being used today. Watching Robert Wiene’s silent movie about a murderous hypnotist, you can observe the sort of visuals that continue to influence horror movies like <em>Nosferatu</em>, such as chiaroscuro lighting (heavy contrasts of light and shadow), jagged, angular buildings, and twisted, disorienting backgrounds. The scenes feel even creepier due to the older camera technology, the scratches on the film, and the eerie glow of the film stock. You can clearly see where Eggers, as well as directors like Tim Burton, draw their inspiration from.</p></div><div><p>During an appearance on Alamo Drafthouse’s YouTube series <em>Guest Selects</em>, Eggers praised Jack Clayton’s <em>The Innocents</em> as “one of the best—perhaps the best—gothic ghost movies ever made.” The film follows a governess who fears her children are possessed. Eggers mentioned that he watches the movie a couple of times a year for inspiration, and it’s evident that much of its essence will influence <em>Nosferatu</em>. Eggers was particularly inspired by Freddy Francis’ cinematography, which uses special glass filters to create a cocoon-like effect and tight framing that makes the spaces feel oppressive. In every shot, Clayton carefully positions the actors against the intricate architecture of the sprawling mansion, which dominates the scene to suggest an otherworldly presence lurking within the walls. The film is visually stunning yet deeply unsettling.</p></div><div><p>Talent and a penchant for horror clearly run in the family. Lily-Rose Depp, who stars in <em>Nosferatu</em>, follows in the footsteps of her father Johnny Depp, who was also part of a classic horror retelling: Tim Burton’s <em>Sleepy Hollow</em>, based on Washington Irving’s tale of the headless horseman. Both films are historical, set in the 18th and 19th centuries, and are filled with elaborate gowns, ripped bodices, stuffy waistcoats, and tailored trousers. They also share a grim, Gothic, grayscale color palette. Tim Burton emphasizes the vividness of red blood, making it stand out as it spills in buckets. Despite these visual similarities, the two films convey different tones: Burton’s film has a more cartoonish, whimsical vibe, while <em>Nosferatu</em> appears to be more sensuous and classical.</p></div><div><p>Gary Oldman chews the scenery as Vlad the Impaler, a warrior who loses his beloved wife to suicide, and later as the older Count Dracula, complete with a ridiculous wig resembling giant orbs. There are strong performances from Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, though not so much from Keanu Reeves. Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>Dracula</em> adaptation is hypersexual and goofy in the weirdest ways—more colorful and splashy than Gothic and dark. For some, this ostentatious style suits a character who thrives on decadence and desire. With over-the-top dialogue and dramatics, combined with camerawork that whirls and twirls through Dracula’s lavish castle, it’s an epic adaptation worth watching. It even includes stylish visual homages to the original <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>.</p></div><div><p><em>Nosferatu</em>’s Count Orlok is not the first terrifying character Bill Skarsgård has transformed into; he also portrayed Pennywise the Clown in the recent adaptation of Stephen King’s epic novel <em>It</em>, which follows a group of children confronting an alien entity that haunts their Maine town of Derry over several decades. As Pennywise, Skarsgård immersed himself in the role not only through grotesque prosthetics—featuring a bulbous head, buck teeth, yellow eyes, clown makeup, and a twisted smile—but also through his unsettling physicality. His movements are eerily fluid, and his voice, initially light and fluffy like cotton candy, can shift instantly to become gruff and menacing. This commitment to transforming his physicality will likely be on display again in <em>Nosferatu</em>, and watching <em>It</em> offers just a glimpse of how demonic Skarsgård can be.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lighthouse</em> is another Eggers film you should catch up on. Shot in stark black-and-white and filled with salty sea dog language, it immerses you in its claustrophobic island setting, surrounded by tantalizing mermaids and flocks of seagulls—one of which meets a violent end. In this isolated and stormy space, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson’s lighthouse keepers slowly descend into madness, creating a dizzying spectacle of cursing, heavy drinking, farting, and simmering sexual tension. The ending leaves a haunting final image that lingers long after the credits roll.</p></div><div><p>Eggers made a striking debut with <em>The Witch</em> in 2015, immediately establishing himself as a distinct new filmmaker. From this film, you’ll quickly get a sense of what to expect from him: folkloric tales of darkness with a Gothic aesthetic and antiquated dialogue. <em>The Witch</em> immerses you in the mundane, rigid daily life of Puritan New England, as a family accuses their daughter of witchcraft following the disappearance of their youngest son. Eggers carefully and methodically builds the tension, uncertainty, and mistrust, culminating in a mystical and deliciously sinful finale. After watching it, you’ll never look at a goat the same way again.</p></div><div><p>Another important influence on Eggers is Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula in Tod Browning’s 1931 version of the tale. Lugosi’s take on the world’s most famous vampire became the quintessential archetype—mysterious and monstrous, yet debonair and hypnotic, with a regal cape, a transfixing stare, and the ability to glide through his castle like a ghost. The film exudes a Gothic elegance that is more seductive than frightening, a quality <em>Nosferatu</em> may draw upon in its own way.</p></div><div><p>Eggers told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Empire</em> magazine</a></span> that he has been “consciously not watching” Werner Herzog’s version of <em>Nosferatu</em>, though he did end up shooting at the same castle, Pernštejn Castle in the Czech Republic. It seems Eggers is avoiding this version because it’s another filmmaker’s interpretation of the original, and he doesn’t want to cloud his own vision. However, for us as the audience, it’s fascinating to watch and compare the original silent film, Eggers’ adaptation, and Herzog’s version. Herzog’s <em>Nosferatu</em> is highly stylized, with every frame resembling a slowly moving painting. Eschewing the shadow-drenched visuals typical of the genre, Herzog often bathes Klaus Kinski’s Count Dracula in bright light, highlighting his pale white skin and sunken eyes. Much of the terror comes not from what is hidden but from what is revealed. This approach contrasts sharply with Eggers’ darker, more somber aesthetic, offering a compelling study in how different directors can interpret the same iconic story.</p></div><div><p>There’s some meta casting in Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em>, as Willem Dafoe, who plays Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz, also portrayed actor Max Schreck in <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, a fictionalized account of the making of <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, Max Schreck takes his role as the prowling vampire a little too seriously—so much so that he might actually be a vampire. This clever premise leads to humorous moments about method acting, with Schreck skulking around the set creepily and even eating bats, while John Malkovich’s F.W. Murnau gleefully captures it all on camera. The film builds to a chilling finale where fiction and reality blend in the most horrifying and violent ways, adding an unsettling layer to Dafoe’s connection to the <em>Nosferatu</em> legacy.</p></div><div><p>A key film to watch before Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is, of course, the 1922 original directed by F.W. Murnau, <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Nosferatu</em>, you can see the German Expressionist techniques that have influenced countless horror films since, such as exaggerated, theatrical gestures and the use of tilted camera angles. So many images from the film remain powerful and unforgettable, from Orlok’s shadow creeping across the wall as he stalks his prey to the ravishing Ellen clutching her heart and collapsing into bed. Perhaps most striking of all is the image of Max Schreck as Count Orlok standing motionless in a hallway, his eyes bulging and his sharp claws outstretched. It’s thrilling to witness the infancy of the horror genre in <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>, a silent film that, even over a century later, continues to send shivers down spines with its blend of terror and artistic innovation.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bendy-lone-wolf-roguelike-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Joey Drew Studios has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf</em>, but it looks like this one will be taking a slightly different tack with regards to genre.</p>

<p>Where previous&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>games were (by and large) first-person horror affairs,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>is a roguelike that pits its titular canine Boris against "endlessly generated corridors" and "ever increasing odds".</p>

<p>Exploring the twisting hallways of the <em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series' fictional Joey Drew Studios (for which the developer is also named), Boris will need his wits about him as "monsters and obstacles emerge from every direction".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=U1Bd5DSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=6YeGBlx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>pits Boris against the ever-shifting corridors of Joey Drew Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>As Boris explores, he'll come up against the "cartoon creeps of the Dark Puddles", and it's up to you to use the weapons and resources you've gathered, as well as "the clever use of dangerous traps", to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll be chased by a truly terrifying foe known only as the Ink Demon, and it sounds like you won't be able to fight him. Instead, you'll have to "run and hide" when you hear the "beating of his ink heart".</p>

<p>It's a shift away from&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>'s traditional first-person horror puzzling, but it looks like the game still retains the signature atmosphere of the&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series. You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Action roguelikes (or roguelites) based on popular franchises are becoming increasingly prevalent. In the last couple of years alone, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise" rel="nofollow"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Redacted</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em></a>&nbsp;carrying that particular torch.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>will be released sometime next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3232610/Bendy_Lone_Wolf/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, and it'll also be available on mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>-related.</p>

The RG34XX can be <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg34xx">ordered through Anbernic’s website</a> for $69.99, but is discounted to $63.99 until December 18th. It comes in four colors, including the GBA’s original purple and black, as well as transparent green and red options.</p><p>Although it looks nearly identical to the original GBA’s hardware, the RG34XX adds a pair of additional action buttons, two more shoulder buttons, microSD card slots, an HDMI port, and a larger 3.4-inch display with a 720x480 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio. The handheld also appears to carry over the GBA’s volume dial, but it’s actually a two-way toggle switch allowing the volume to be adjusted up and down in small increments.</p><p>The RG34XX only became available for sale starting today, but Anbernic sent units to reviewers last week so we already have our first impressions of the new handheld. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Russ Crandall</a>, who runs the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, found the emulator to be a “nearly perfect” recreation of Nintendo’s hardware. That can be either a good or bad thing, depending on how you remember the GBA’s ergonomics.</p><p>The RG34XX is powered by the Allwinner H700 chipset that Anbernic has already used in eight other devices. It won’t be able to play all the games released for 3D consoles like the Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, and Sony PSP, but the handheld will handle 16-bit games with ease, and excels at emulating the Game Boy Advance given the matching screen ratio.</p><div><figcaption><em>The secondary set of shoulder buttons on the RG34XX are smaller and positioned in a way that larger hands may struggle to comfortably reach.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keep Retro</cite></p></div><p><a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/anbernic-rg34xx-review/">Retro Handhelds</a>, a site that focuses on portable devices for playing classic games, also found the RG34XX to be an accurate recreation of the GBA, but found it a little cramped for larger hands to play. The RG34XX’s primary shoulder buttons, located in the same position as the GBA’s felt good. However, the secondary set, which are smaller and positioned closer to where the GBA’s cartridge slot was located, were not very comfortable to use.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a massive hit from the start--so much so that the sales of Elden Ring have almost caught up with From's previous franchise, Dark Souls, in just under three years.</p><p>Bandai Namco has announced that as of September 2024, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million copies worldwide. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC expansion surely helped raise those numbers in 2024. Before Elden Ring's 2022 release, the Dark Souls games sold 27 million copies combined. This led some observers to suggest that Elden Ring had already surpassed Dark Souls' all-time numbers.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fun Fact: The entire Dark Souls series had sold 27 million units combined prior to Elden Ring's release. <br>Now Elden Ring alone has surpassed that total. <a href="https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ</a></p>  — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, that was a premature assessment.

But given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-just-20-for-black-friday/1100-6527932/" data-ref-id="1100-6527932">Elden Ring was heavily discounted for Black Friday</a>, it may have closed some of the distance between the two franchises.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/please-don%E2%80%99t-make-me-do-a-camera-quest.1062597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m finally playing <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. I’ve had a good time so far climbing all over the game’s Vatican map and getting into clumsy fistfights, but one thing that hasn’t been such a good time are the quests that involve the in-game camera, because I hate in-game cameras.</p><p>(Spoilers for the first quest and some early side missions of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.)</p><p>Early on in the game, you have to purchase a camera. You need it to move the story forward, but it’s also used in side activities: you’ll overhear some nuns wishing they had a photo of Indy’s pal Father Antonio, so you can go snap a pic and give it to them. A priest is bummed he didn’t get a photo of the Sistine Chapel, so you can take one for him. As I wandered the Vatican, I’d constantly get prompts that there was something I could take a picture of; I’d equip my camera, raise it to my face, and swing the viewfinder around until the game told me what it wanted me to snap.</p><figure></figure><p>These kinds of tasks in games drive me nuts. I’ve always chalked this up to being primarily a PC gamer–my whole machine is basically a camera, able to take screenshots with a single button press, so in-game cameras make a simple task more clunky by throwing a bunch of interface stuff in the way. I hate having to swap things around in my inventory just to <em>look</em> at something, the task I’m already mainly engaged in through playing a first-person game. I hate trying to figure out what a game wants me to take a picture of and then trying to take whatever the game thinks is an acceptable picture of it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Indiana Jones</em>’ implementation of this task at least <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3ldf5ohpbdk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guides you </a>toward the correct framing by giving you a viewfinder to line up with, and it also gives you visual and audio prompts when there’s something photographable nearby. But last night, when I was playing through the area under the Vatican, I kept getting photo prompts as I was busy evading fascists and trying to escape the labyrinthian area; really not the time to stop for photos! (I should also mention that I’m playing on keyboard and mouse despite the game suggesting I don’t, which makes pulling things out of my inventory slightly more cumbersome than I imagine it is with a controller.) So far, most of the game's camerawork has been optional, so as long as I can deal with ignoring the little prompt, I can mostly pretend it doesn’t exist. I’m not sure how long that will last, though. </p><p>I complained about these quests on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ldeyxhhy622r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, where many people defended their love of in-game camera quests, or games like <em>Umurangi Generation</em> or <em>Pokemon Snap</em> that are <em>just</em> about taking pictures. I support all of this! I’m envious that you are able to find joy where I am not, through a very popular mechanic that many people seem to like. I know that my dislike of in-game camera quests is a narrow personal gripe, getting into “<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hating double jump</a>” territory, and I appreciate hearing why other people like them because maybe, one day, I can learn to like them too. Please teach me your ways or, failing that, at least help me feel like less of a killjoy by admitting that you don't like them either.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley"><h3>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results</h3></a><p>Geoff Keighley wants to be perceived as an agent of change for the better, but he's propped up by the status quo</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-brings-a-classic-detective-mystery-next-year.1062579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/agatha-christie-death-on-nile-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile</em>, a brand new adaptation of one of the mystery writer's most celebrated books, and the adventure game is due to hit PC and current-gen consoles next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.microids.com/microids-unveils-the-video-game-adaptation-of-the-iconic-novel-agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Microids says its&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>adaptation will explore "all-new plots, advanced gameplay mechanics and a unique setting" in the form of 1970s Egypt, so even if you've read the book, it sounds like you'll still have plenty to discover.</p>

<p>This time around, you won't just be playing as the legendary Hercule Poirot, but also as new detective Jane Royce, who must pursue her own investigation adjacent to Poirot's. The two investigations will then "collide" in Abu Simbel, an important location in the original novel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Xo8KrHNY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Yc5zzHQJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>introduces us to Jane Royce, a new detective character.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've read Christie's original book, Jane Royce is an entirely new creation for this game, so it'll be interesting to see where her investigation takes her and how it dovetails with the mystery from the novel.</p>

<p>As well as a new character and new plot threads, Microids' adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>will also offer a raised level of difficulty, "more complex puzzles", and "more freedom in the progression of the investigation", according to Microids head David Chomard.</p>

<p>He also promises a closer dovetailing of Poirot's and Royce's stories when compared to those of Poirot and Joanna Locke in&nbsp;<em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, which was Microids Studio Lyon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/murder-on-orient-express-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous stab at a Poirot game</a>.</p>

<p>You'll use the detectives' mindmap - which looks not unlike the mind palace from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sherlock-holmes-awakened-gets-release-date-goes-gold" rel="nofollow">Frogwares'</a>&nbsp;<em>Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/how-frogwares-created-sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-without-crunch" rel="nofollow">games</a> - to piece the cases together, and you'll then confront suspects to expose their lies. It all sounds like classic detective adventure stuff.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for <i>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</i>yet, but when it arrives, you'll be able to play it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3150480/Agatha_Christie__Death_on_the_Nile/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

Half of them will require you to grind through some challenges while the other half are more varied in their restrictions. If you’re like me and want to get as much free stuff as possible, you’ve come to the right place. Here, we’re listing every free skin in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and how to get them.</p><h2 id="h1351"><a id=""></a>How To Unlock Free Skins In <em>Marvel Rivals</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="b9a86ee5c7eee3fc4be9cce6679e2f3f" data-recommend-id="image://b9a86ee5c7eee3fc4be9cce6679e2f3f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Moon Knight stands in his default pose with the Golden Moonlight skin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Moon Knight stands in his default pose with the Golden Moonlight skin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Illustration<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9a86ee5c7eee3fc4be9cce6679e2f3f" data-recommend-id="image://b9a86ee5c7eee3fc4be9cce6679e2f3f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Moon Knight stands in his default pose with the Golden Moonlight skin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em></strong><em> </em><strong>launched with eight free skins to collect.</strong> Two of them are tied to a specific platform, so we’ll first talk about the six everyone can get.

However, there is a very small difference between the two. The one available in the store has the Lost Control emote instead of 300 Chrono Tokens. Don’t let that stop you from getting this free set of stuff though! I can confirm that after getting all of the above for free, the in-game bundle was discounted since I owned everything except for the emote.</p><p>Aside from the Hela skin in the battle pass, there is no telling how many of these skins will remain once Season 0 finishes up.
