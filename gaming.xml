<p>In a new update, bumping the game up to Version 21.0, an <a href="https://ninjalathegame.com/en/news/info/season21.html">official announcement</a> mentions how the team has decided Season 21 and the latest Ninjala Pass will "run indefinitely".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for playing Ninjala. The Ninjala Team has an announcement regarding the duration of Season 21.</p>
<p>In order to provide all Ninjala users with an enjoyable experience and stable service over the long term, we have decided Season 21 will run indefinitely.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067txvrpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Accordingly, the Season 21 Ninjala Pass will also last indefinitely. We will still continue to hold various events such as WNA Tours.</p>

<p>The servers for Ninjala <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjalaTheGame/comments/1mpvum3/season_21_ends_in_12_years/">apparently won't be going away</a> anytime soon. The title even received a Switch 2 compatibility update on 19th June 2025 - fixing some "previously identified issues".</p>
<p>This bubblegum ninja game was released for free on the Switch eShop in June 2020, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/ninjalas_release_gets_delayed_until_june_due_to_the_coronavirus_outbreak_gungho_president_apologises">after multiple delays</a>. When Ninjala was initially revealed, it was often compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a> – with GungHo's CEO Kazuki Morishita <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/06/ninjala_isnt_really_like_splatoon_but_wed_love_to_do_a_crossover_says_gungho_ceo">describing it as being "very different".</a></p>
<p>In our review of the game here on Nintendo Life around the time of its release, we awarded Ninjala seven out of ten stars.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As we get ready for Gears of War: Reloaded, here’s every mainline Gears of War game ranked from worst to best. </p>



<p>First of all, considering any Gears of War game as “the worst” is slightly unfair. Every Gears game is great, just some are better than others, so when we say worst, we’re not throwing shade on any entries whatsoever. </p>



<p>However, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is about to come tearing onto PS5 on August 26, 2025, we thought it would be fun to rank the mainline entries of the series. Now, we won’t be including any spin-offs like Gears Tactics, as they don’t really count. But we will be ranking every game in the main series from worst to the very best. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-gears-of-war-judgement">6. Gears of War: Judgement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears Judgement is a great prequel, but the weakest entry in the series. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War: Judgement is a prequel to the original Gears of War that takes place a short time before it, but still several weeks after the dreaded “Emergence Day”. Instead of Marcus Fenix, players control the fan-favorite Damon Baird after he’s been put on trial for disobeying orders. </p>



<p>The game is infamously short and doesn’t do anything especially new; instead, it mostly just offers more of the same Gears gameplay that players had grown accustomed to. However, as Judgement sometimes feels more like a DLC than a mainline entry, this is forgivable, and the game is still considered an essential part of the Gears saga. </p>



<p>As Judgement came a couple of years after Gears of War 3, it was nice to see these characters again, and Judgement was also the most visually stunning game in the series to date when it arrived in 2013. Is Judgement the worst game in the Gears series? Yes. Should you play it before Gears of War: Reloaded? Absolutely. </p>



<h2 id="h-5-gears-of-war-4">5. Gears of War 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears 4 represented a new beginning. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War 4 was a soft reboot of the Gears series in some ways. It was released in 2016 and marked the series’ debut on the Xbox One, making it the most technically impressive entry since Judgement. Set 25 years after the epic showdown at the end of Gears 3, characters like Marcus Fenix were now grizzled veterans, trying to guide new characters like Kait and Marcus’s son, J.D.</p>



<p>The game is great fun and was a bold new way to kick off a new era for the series, but sadly, audiences struggled to warm to J.D. and Kait like they did to Marcus and the gang. We were with them for every triumphant and agonizing moment, so moving on with a new generation just didn’t feel right. </p>



<p>The good news is that Gears 4 was mostly supposed to be an introduction to a new era of Gears games, as things would really get going again in the sequel. </p>



<h2 id="h-4-gears-5">4. Gears 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears 5 finally delivered on the promise of 4. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we’re talking. Gears 5 was the first entry to come to the Xbox Series X|S, and boy, was it the main course to the appetizer that was Gears 4. After the last game’s rather shocking ending, players now took control of Kait, who finally came into her own as a compelling protagonist—and one worthy of taking the baton from Marcus Fenix.  </p>



<p>Even J.D. managed to be more interesting in this outing, and more importantly, the game got the balance right between letting the new characters shine but also celebrating the beloved characters from the original trilogy. Somehow, old man Marcus is even more fun to watch than his younger self. </p>



<p>Gears 5 also revamped the multiplayer and finally delivered an experience that mirrored the legendary moments from the early games. The more open-world approach to the campaign caused some controversy among old-school fans, but we’re of the view that they got the balance just right between exploration and high-octane shooting sections. </p>



<h2 id="h-3-gears-of-war-3">3. Gears of War 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears 3 is the perfect ending to the original trilogy. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War 3 suffered from “third chapter syndrome” somewhat, especially after Gears 2 represented the series’ Empire Strikes Back moment. But that didn’t stop it from being a stellar sequel, not to mention a fitting and powerful ending to the original trilogy. Not only did it round up the Gears of War story beautifully, but it also left the door open for future sequels, which did eventually arrive.</p>



<p>The game saw Marcus and his surviving Gears finally take the fight to the entity that had caused them so much suffering and get some much-needed payback. Of course, there were a few twists to the tale, but Gears 3 delivered everything a conclusive trilogy-ender should. It also offered a bombastic campaign and the most comprehensive multiplayer experience the series had seen so far. </p>



<h2 id="h-2-gears-of-war">2. Gears of War</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears of War is where it all started. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War came at a time (2006) when the Xbox 360 really needed more flagship games, and along with titles like Mass Effect, gave the console something to hang its hat on. Inspired by third-person shooters like Resident Evil 4 and fictional universes like Warhammer 40,000, Gears of War saw a planet facing an alien invasion, but from within. </p>



<p>The Locust swarm attacked humanity by crawling up from underground. While we won’t spoil what they were, just know that they were a threat to rival The Reapers, The Covenant, and monsters like the Tyrnaids. Players would take control of Marcus Fenix and his squad as they bravely took the battle to The Reapers, at great cost.</p>



<p>Gears of War quickly became one of the most celebrated games on Xbox 360, eventually spawning sequels and lots more spin-off material. The series is still going strong in 2025 with a remaster, Gears of War: Reloded, set to release in August. </p>



<h2 id="h-1-gears-of-war-2">1. Gears of War 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears of War 2 is peak Gears. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>After the slightly experimental original game became a success, a sequel became inevitable and followed in 2008. Gears 2 is easily the most beloved and celebrated game in the series, as Marcus Fenix and the gang learned shocking secrets about the Locusts and the price of defeating them. </p>



<p>Gears 2 was Aliens to Gears 1’s Alien, blowing the series wide open and doing everything bigger and with more explosions, drama, and compulsive gun battles. It also introduced Horde Mode for players who had finished the epic campaign. The best thing about Gears 2 is that if the third game represents the crescendo, Gears 2 is the build-up to it, which is always the best and most thrilling part.</p>



<p>However, the biggest achievement of Gears of War 2 is its multiplayer mode, something that helped establish the Xbox 360 as the best place to game online with friends. While Sony consoles have caught Microsoft up in that regard today, this wasn’t the case in the 360 / PS3 era, and Gears of War 2 is a huge part of why that’s the case. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Have No Info on The Game At All’: Fairgames Has Not Been Cancelled]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fairgames-not-cancelled-confirmation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98i-have-no-info-on-the-game-at-all%E2%80%99-fairgames-has-not-been-cancelled.1272042/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a shock tidbit of news sprang up when it was claimed that Fairgames, an upcoming third-person PlayStation shooter from Haven Studios, had been <strong>cancelled</strong>. This news came courtesy of Michael Pachter, a prolific industry analyst who was speaking during his Pachter Factor podcast.</p>



<p>However, Pachter has now come out to retract his statement and issue an apology for the confusion. As far as we know, Fairgames (stylized as ‘Fairgame$’) hasn’t been cancelled.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fairgames-still-coming-out">Is Fairgames Still Coming Out?</h2>



<p>From what we know, Fairgames is still coming out despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios-after-founding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent departure of the studio’s founder</a>, Jade Raymond.</p>



<p>This is what led Michael Pachter to make the claim about Fairgames, jumping to a conclusion that the game must be cancelled as the studio’s founder has departed the business.</p>



<p>As Pachter’s statement spread like wildfire on social media, the analyst was contacted <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1956792553954771444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Destin Legarie</a> for clarification:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I misspoke. Said Jade was let go, and assumed it was cancelled. I have no info on the game at all. Feel free to quote this, I truly don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, it was claimed that Fairgames had been pushed back to 2026 as early testing phases started cropping up. The game, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fairgame-revealed-playstation/">was revealed in 2023</a>, will be Haven Studios’ first title, and it’s expected to be a typical live-service shooter under the PlayStation banner.</p>



<p>Because those have panned out <strong>so well</strong> in recent years…</p>



<p>When it was revealed, I wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s poised to offer up a fresh multiplayer gaming experience, with players having the ability to launch intense, ambitious heists with their friends while fighting to secure riches against other players in the same environment. It looks bright, it looks innovative, and it’s the first new IP from Haven Studios.</p>




</blockquote>



<p>Fairgames is still on the horizon, for now. Are you looking forward to the heist-based shooter? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grow a Garden fans are busying themselves with constructing enormous beanstalks in the Beanstalk Update, providing Jack with what he needs to generate a towering plant. This magical, limited-time event requires players to give Jack specific plant types, and in this guide, we’re kicking off by looking at Woody Plants in Grow a Garden.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hunting Grow a Garden’s Woody Plants, look no further than this guide. If you’re after something else like Prickly Plants or Tropical Plants, fear not – I’ve included those below too.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-beanstalk-update-in-grow-a-garden">What is the Beanstalk Update in Grow a Garden</h2>



<p>The Beanstalk Update in Grow a Garden is a special, magical event that requires players to help grow an enormous beanstalk. It’s a tale right out of the classic children’s book of stories, and it’s a collaborative event that requires a bit of teamwork.</p>



<p>Players will be requested to bring Jack, who is located in the centre of the map, various plant types. When he receives these plant types, be it Woody, Flower, Candy, or something else entirely, he’ll generate a hulking beanstalk that players can climb.</p>



<p>It’s simple but very entertaining.</p>



<h2 id="h-grow-a-garden-woody-plants-list">Grow a Garden Woody Plants List</h2>



<p>Here are all the Woody Plants in Grow a Garden, which represents a massive list that Jack will ask for in the Beanstalk Update:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Woody Plant Item</strong></td><td><strong>How to Find Woody Plant</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Rhubarb</td><td>Culinarian Chest</td></tr><tr><td>Pear</td><td>Summer Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Duskpuff</td><td>Sprout Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Apple</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Avocado</td><td>Summer Merchant Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Mangosteen</td><td>Sprout Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Coconut</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Kiwi</td><td>Summer Merchant Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Mango</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Peach</td><td>Normal Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Nectarine</td><td>Honey Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Moon Mango</td><td>Twilight Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Gleamroot</td><td>Sprout Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Maple Apple</td><td>Zen Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Traveler’s Fruit</td><td>Summer Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Moon Blossom</td><td>Night Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Cacao</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Hive Fruit</td><td>Honey Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Feijoa</td><td>Summer Merchant Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Giant Pinecone</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>These Woody Plants in Grow a Garden are listed in order of their value to the Beanstalk Update. The Giant Pinecone is worth seven points towards the beanstalk, while the Rhubarb is only worth two points.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A sliding bug in the Battlefield 6 Beta has been found to be causing many players to experience horrible aim.</p>



<p>Have you been experiencing horrible aim or bloom in the Battlefield 6 Beta without any explanation? Well, it’s down to sliding.</p>



<p>The issue was first spotted by Shroud, and subsequently investigated further by content creator Exclusive Ace, who, in his video, outlined exactly what happens and how to fix it.</p>



<p>The short version of what’s happening with the bug is that players who have their sliding animation interrupted or canceled will still have the calculations of sliding (bloom) assigned to the player. This means that regardless of what the player is doing, be that standing still or crouching, the calculations of sliding will still give the player bloom.</p>



<p>Getting out of the bug is simple: complete an uninterrupted slide, and your aim will return to normal.</p>

<p>You can watch Exclusive Ace’s full video below to get a better understanding of how exactly the bug works:</p>

(&amp; How to Fix it)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXURdayG57k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It’s probably too late for the developers to fix the bug by the end of the Beta at this point, but presumably, it’s an easy fix to have done by the time the game fully launches on October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Beta officially ends in the early hours of Monday, August 18th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> is the first 3D game in Nintendo’s ape-starring franchise since <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> way back in 1999, so expectations were high for the titular character’s newest outing. There’s a lot to love about this adventure, which sees Donkey Kong join up with a young Pauline as he punches, rolls, and slaps his way through open-ended levels filled with secrets and challenges. But how many hours will it take you to see everything? Let’s take a look at the length of the <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> campaign and what else there is to do beyond it.</p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>?</h2> <p>If you just want to punch your way through to the end of this DK expedition, <b>you can expect to spend around 10-15 hours beating the </b><b><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></b><b> campaign</b>. This makes it a pretty beefy experience in an age where many 3D platformers come in at half that length or less. And that’s just for the base adventure! There’s still a ton of monkeying around to do beyond that.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-amiibo-letters-ball-outfit-1851786640">Here’s What Amiibos Can Do For You In <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></a></p> <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>‘s world is immensely dense with extra things you can find to do beyond just reaching the end of its campaign. It is a 3D platformer, after all, so it wouldn’t be complete without a treasure trove of stuff to collect—though I hope that’s not bringing back any bad memories of <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> and its thousands of collectibles.</p>

 <p>You can opt to tackle finding everything in <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> during your initial playthrough, or you can dive back in after beating the main story. However you go about it, there’s a great time to be had tracking down all the Golden Bananas, Banandium Gems, music discs, and fossils in the game.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349">Don’t Sleep On <i>Donkey Kong Banana</i>’s Co-Op Mode</a></p> <p>And while they’re all fun to find, definitely don’t pass up any opportunities to get fossils, even if you’re just trying to mainline the campaign. They’re cool because you can use them to unlock new outfits for DK and Pauline, which you can then mix and match to your fashion tastes. But more importantly, they often sport helpful passive bonuses like improved swimming speed or reduced damage from poison. Any bit of help you can get for survivability is a good thing, yeah?</p> <p>Whether you’re rushing through the campaign or trying to go for 100%, you can start bashing your way through <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> right away. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Animal rights campaign group PETA is calling on Nintendo to remove <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Cow's nose ring.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.peta.org/news/peta-mario-kart-world-controversy-cow-nose/">statement</a>, PETA said no real-world cow would sport Cow's "goofy grin" if they were forced to wear a ring, "a tool of cruelty that causes lasting pain and discomfort", and wrote to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa earlier this week to explain that "nose rings are forcibly pierced through one of the most sensitive parts of a cow's body", often used to drag or control cows ans bulls "to their deaths".</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"We know Mario Kart World is just a game – and that's exactly why Cow’s nose ring needs to go," the organisation said. "Mario Kart is supposed to be a fun escape, not a reminder of the painful tools used on cows in the meat and dairy industries. No one wants to think about animal suffering while zipping around a race track."</p><p>The dairy industry also reportedly clips "spiked nose rings on baby cows so that the comforting act of nursing from their mother causes her pain and the baby is rejected and kicked away. To control bulls, a chain might be fastened from the nose ring to the bull’s horn for even more pain-driven control".</p>
<p>"It's not a style choice," the organisation added, "It's a cruel tool used to control and hurt cows in the meat and dairy industries, which causes lasting pain and discomfort."</p>
<p>PETA has previously taken action against other games, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which it said encouraged "abusive behaviour toward fish and insects [...] tearing wildlife out of their homes and display them in cramped cases in a museum". It's also launched campaigns against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> and Hunting Simulator 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of Mario Kart World, meaning the launch title had an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>

<p>After the success of <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2</i> in 2020, it was only a matter of time before more of the famous skater’s beloved games got the remake treatment. After nearly five years, <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> has finally ollied onto the scene sporting a fresh coat of paint and a wide variety of enhancements to make it the best way to experience two skating classics.</p> <p>But if you have some friends who play their games on a different platform than you, you may be left wondering whether you can get into multiplayer matches with them in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>. You might also be curious just how long these two games will last you. Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this classic skating experience.</p> <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossplay"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support crossplay?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re hoping you can hop online and skate with friends who game on other platforms, well, you’re in luck! <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> has full crossplay support across all platforms</b>. This means you can easily hop into multiplayer games with up to seven other players across all consoles and PC, opening up plenty of opportunities for grinding rails and popping tricks together.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>While playing with anyone you want online is a huge win for virtual skaters everywhere, things don’t fare quite as well for cross-progression fans. <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at all</b>. As a result, any progress you make on one platform will not carry over to another, meaning you’ll need to start over entirely if you pick up the game on more than one device.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-skaters-are-in-the-games"></span>How many skaters are in the games?<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618079"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618079">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><i>THPS 3 + 4</i> will give you a total of 29 skaters to choose from, with a few hidden ones you can unlock as well.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andrew Reynolds</li> <li aria-level="1">Aori Nishimura</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurélien Giraud</li> <li aria-level="1">Bob Burnquist</li> <li aria-level="1">Bucky Lasek</li> <li aria-level="1">Chad Muska</li> <li aria-level="1">Chloe Covell</li> <li aria-level="1">Elissa Steamer</li> <li aria-level="1">Eric Koston</li> <li aria-level="1">Geoff Rowley</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Foy</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Thomas</li> <li aria-level="1">Kareem Campbell</li> <li aria-level="1">Leo Baker</li> <li aria-level="1">Leticia Bufoni</li> <li aria-level="1">Lizzie Armanto</li> <li aria-level="1">Margielyn Didal</li> <li aria-level="1">Nora Vasconcellos</li> <li aria-level="1">Nyjah Huson</li> <li aria-level="1">Rayssa Leal</li> <li aria-level="1">Riley Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Rodney Mullen</li> <li aria-level="1">Rune Glifberg</li> <li aria-level="1">Shane O’Neill</li> <li aria-level="1">Steve Cabellero</li> <li aria-level="1">Tony Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Tyshawn Jones</li> <li aria-level="1">Yuto Horigome</li> <li aria-level="1">Zion Wright</li> </ul> <p>You can also unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andy Anderson</li> <li aria-level="1">Bam Margera</li> <li aria-level="1">Birdman</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-officer-dick-unlock-panda-plush-locations-2000614519">Constable Richard (Officer Dick)</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Michelangelo</li> </ul> <p>The Doom Slayer and Revenant from the recent <i>Doom </i>games is also available via the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-long-is-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>How long is <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"><i>THPS 4 </i>doesn’t have a Career mode</a>, but you’ll still be able to complete certain goals on different parks like Foundry and Shipyard. In <i>THPS 3</i>, there are 9 parks to play on and 10 in <i>THPS 4.</i></p> <p>Each park has ten Standard goals and five Pro goals. It only takes about <b>4-5 hours</b> to complete all of the Standard goals.</p> <p>Once all the Standard goals have been completed, you’ll unlock Pro goals. Even after completing Pro goals, you’ll unlock Platinum goals. Each park has a single one and they usually involve pulling off a certain move somewhere in the park. These steps should take about another <b>5 hours.</b></p>

 <h2><span id="getting-100percent-in-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>Getting 100-percent in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618080"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618080">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>After completing all the Pro goals, you’ll unlock Solo Tour, and this is where the real time sink begins. There’s one trophy/achievement called Flying Solo. This requires you to beat the Solo Tour with <b>all 35 characters</b>. Yes, you’ll have to go through this mode at least 35 times. This is easily the most time-consuming part of the journey to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <p>But it’s important to note that you do not need to achieve 100% with every skater, which includes completing things like optional challenges. You only need to complete each skater’s unique career path to count towards Flying Solo.You do NOT need 100% with each skater. Just complete their unique career path once.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, there are no missable trophies/achievements so you can tackle them in any order you wish. There are also no difficulty-related ones, so you can customize the settings to your liking without having to worry. Overall, getting all of the trophies/achievements should take you between <b>25-35 hours.</b></p> <p>However, there are certain assist mods like Perfect Rail Balance and Instant Quick Recovery that can void trophies/achievements. There are two of them, which are “Extra Ball” and “Unprecedented.” Their descriptions specifically state that you cannot have assist mods activated..</p>

 <p><b>Extra Ball: </b>“Without Assist Mods, score 1,000,000 or over in Pinball.”<br> <b>Unprecedented:</b> “Without Assist Mods, earn a score of 10,000,000 in any park in a 2-minute session or single combo.”</p> <p>It seems like these two are the only ones impacted by assist mods, so you can turn them on when going for any other trophies/achievements. Good luck, and have fun!</p> <hr> <p>If you’re ready to team up with some pals and hit some skateparks and beyond in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>, you can get started right away. The game is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 will reportedly release on 14th November, 2025, and there's still no <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release planned.</p>
<p>That's according to noted and highly reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383">Dealabs</a> leaker billbil-kun, who suggests the latest instalment of Activision's tentpole franchise will be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series, but will not be available on Switch at launch.</p>

<p>We noted Nintendo Switch 2 was notably absent from the launch platform line-up when the game was revealed during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-team-committed-to-bringing-series-to-nintendo-as-black-ops-7-release-omits-switch-2">Summer Games Fest</a>, running counter to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">10-year promise to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms on "the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity"</a> if its gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard was approved. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Which it was</a>, of course.</p>
<p>At the time, however, sources confirmed to Eurogamer: "We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready."</p>
<p>Dealabs posits that all this release information will be confirmed at next week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, including news of a physical release (with a disc included) and pre-orders set to go live on 20th August, following a reveal the night before at Opening Night Live. While U.S./UK pricing has yet to be leaked or confirmed, the leaker suggests it'll retail for €79.99 in Europe. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">Xbox has, of course, previously pledged not to raise prices past $70 USD</a>.</p>
<p>Former Activision Blizzard president Mike Ybarra thinks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will "boot stomp" Call of Duty this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year">that this will push the CoD series to stop being "lazy"</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Feature: 32 Games We're Dying To See On Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eef768fd91eff/feature-32-games-were-dying-to-see-on-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first months of Switch 2's life have seen plenty of multiplatform games arrive on Nintendo's newest console — winners like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> to name a handful — and its extra power affords devs the chance to bring newer, bigger, more ambitious games to the platform where ports simply weren't viable on the old Switch.</p>
<p>And yes, we've got things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a> to look forward to before the year's out, but we're an insatiable bunch, always wanting more, more, <em>moaaaaar.</em> Honestly, we thought we'd see a few more big-name ports announced during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Showcase</a>, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-reportedly-announce-more-game-ports-for-other-platforms-soon">zero announcements from Microsoft</a> thus far, we're expecting plenty MORE to come throughout the rest of the year.</p>
<p>So here, Team NL presents our <em>most</em> wanted Switch 2 ports. We're not begging — eight years of <em>'Switch when?'</em> have taken their toll on us, too. But hey, our machines are shiny and new and we're jonesing to play some of the following on them...</p>
<div><div><h2>Alan Wake 2</h2>

<div><p>If the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake</a> was a good game, then its sequel is a <em>great</em> one. It leans heavily into survival horror, but the way in which it weaves two parallel storylines is simply marvelous.</p><p>

The visuals are stunning, so a bit of jiggery-pokery might be needed to get it running well, but as long as it’s not comparable to the visual dumpster fire that is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake Remastered</a> on the Switch, then we’re all good. <em>OR</em></p></div>
</div><div><h2>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2>

<p>It seems almost inevitable that <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> will make its way to the Switch 2, so why not start with the latest mainline entry? I haven’t played <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Shadows</a> yet, but it seems to be quite an ambitious experience; one that may well push the Switch 2 toward its limits.</p>
<p>I’m happy to give it a shot on Nintendo’s console, though! I love getting lost in a huge, authentic open world, and what Ubisoft has seemingly accomplished with this one is nothing short of extraordinary. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Baldur's Gate 3</h2>

<p>The Game of the Year winner that brought D&amp;D to the masses back in 2023 and stole my heart with its endless possibilities. The indecisive part of me restarted my file with a different character type at least five times back on PS5, and while I'm hesitant that Switch 2 could run <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> properly without some serious cutbacks, I'd be willing to make it a sixth on the hybrid.</p>
<p>You know, for science. <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Blue Prince</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> is one of those games where you're best going in knowing as little as possible. It's a puzzler, it's a roguelike, it's a reason to fill up a notebook with some of the most indecipherable scribblings I've ever put to paper.</p>
<p>This one got under my skin and wouldn't let me go until I had solved some of its mysteries, and a Switch 2 port would only keep the madness spreading. <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>

<p>Which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/call_of_duty_4_modern_warfare">Call of Duty</a>? Now that's a question for another time, but this series, now that Switch 2 can give us the framerates and online performance it requires, could be a big hit on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>I'd love to be able to kick back with any of the older games for starters, especially <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare">Advanced Warfare</a> (a.k.a the best one), but the real magic, would come in a super solid and slick port of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/call_of_duty_warzone">Call of Duty Warzone</a>. I love this multiplayer slice of CoD, it's the only way I get my fix of it these days, and in portable it could prove to be really hard to put down. Oh, and with gyro aiming? *swoon* <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> is <em>the</em> video game of the moment; almost four months after its release, this French-developed turn-based RPG is still dominating conversations The combat is terrific and the music is <em>phenomenal</em> (please, just listen to the track <a href="https://youtu.be/zmvsw2ILX5k?si=m2UcW7jF855V3OiU">Lumière</a>), but what makes this game so special to me is its story. What it has to say about grief, family, trauma, and how everything is meticulously plotted and paced. Sure, there are plenty of rough edges, but this might be the best debut from a studio in… forever?</p>
<p>More people should play it, and it feels like a no-brainer to bring it to Switch 2. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Death Stranding (2)</h2>

<p>Kojima loves the smell of his own and that winds me up, but there is an unhinged ambition to him that I admire even if I struggle to enjoy it. We're all better off for having him working in games, and having heard discussion around his latest WTFFest, I'm intrigued to experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>I'd take <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> given the choice between 1 and 2. I'm not sure I could manage both. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages</h2>

<p>We’ve got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>. We’ve got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_eternal">DOOM: Eternal</a>. We’ve got all the old <strong>DOOM</strong>s. Let’s make it complete with a port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, hm? Given that the 2016 reboot and its 2020 sequel ran surprisingly well on the Switch, I think The Dark Ages could hold its own on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>And what a game! I know it’s proven to be quite divisive, but it’s my personal favourite of the modern trilogy. I love how <em>heavy</em> it feels compared to the zippy, floaty gameplay in Eternal, and I’ll never tire of ramming into a group of enemies with my shield. Delightfully gory stuff. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>El Paso, Elsewhere</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/el_paso_elsewhere">El Paso, Elsewhere</a> launched on PC and Xbox in September 2023, so it's been a while. The devs, Strange Scaffold, have been busy since then with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">TMNT: Tactical Takedown</a> — which is great, by the way — but perhaps they'd consider bringing this neo-noir homage to <strong>Max Payne</strong> (you know, with vampires) to Switch 2. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Fallout: New Vegas</h2>

<p>Usually I'd go for the newest, biggest and slickest entry in a series for my dream port, but here it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_new_vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> that I'm plumping for, because it's the best one.Thanks.</p>
<p>Yes, it may not look the best - although they all look the same in my opinion, so that helps - but this spin-off has the best characters, writing and choice-driven shenanigans of the lot. Put it on Switch 2 and I will happily play it another couple of times, just to see all the stuff I missed back in ye olden days. PJ</p>
</div><div><h2>Final Fantasy XIV</h2>

<p>I know I <em>could</em> say <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, but the real, best modern Final Fantasy (that isn’t <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Rebirth</a>, and that’s basically guaranteed to come to Switch 2) is a big ol’ MMORPG.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, particularly the <strong>Shadowbringers</strong> and <strong>Endwalker</strong> expansions, touches on all the things I love in storytelling. There’s also just <em>so</em> much to do too, with fun callbacks to the entire series, and so many jobs and crafters to play around with. I’d love to be able to play FFXIV in handheld, and getting it on this new console would be a dream. Put in the effort, and the journey's worth it. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Forza</h2>

<p>As an occasional Forza fan (I played <strong>2</strong> to death, and I bought and enjoyed <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/forza_horizon_4">Horizon 4</a> quite a bit), I'd love to have the series arrive on Switch 2 and bolster a genre which had <em>some</em> bright lights on Switch 1 (hello, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/burnout_paradise_remastered">Burnout Paradise</a>), but which were few and far between.</p>
<p>There's a gap in the library and Microsoft could fill it. That is assuming there's anybody left at any of their studios to work up the port. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Grand Theft Auto 6</h2>

<p>I didn't like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/grand_theft_auto_v">GTA 5</a> much. Sorry, I just really hated Trevor, so I never finished up the story. But, this doesn't mean I ain't excited for the new one, or that I'm not a huge fan of the series, because I am!</p>
<p>However, I am yearning for Rockstar's brand of madness, and I'm really excited about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Now, imagine if they managed to shrink it all down and put it on the Switch 2 so I can play it whilst out and about in my actual hood. We've yet to learn all that much about the game, but I daresay it's gonna be quite the behemoth, and a looker to boot, so I'm gonna suggest we forget about the ray-tracing and it'll all be grand. I am so down with the technical side of things. <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</h2>

<p>Right, listen. <strong>Halo</strong>’s going multiplatform. I know it’s not been officially confirmed yet, but it’s happening. With <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/forza_horizon_5">Forza Horizon 5</a> now on PlayStation and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War</a> shortly making the jump, Halo is seemingly the last bastion of major Xbox exclusives. But not for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-insider-claims-that-halo-master-chief-collection-will-come-to-switch-2">Rumours have already proliferated</a> indicating that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> will soon come to Switch 2, and I reckon it would be the perfect fit. The system is leagues above what the Xbox One could manage, so theoretically every game could run at a slick 4K/60fps, or maybe even 120fps. I personally dive into the original Bungie trilogy at least once a year, so playing them on the go on the Switch 2 sounds like a dream come true. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Hi-Fi Rush</h2>

<p>I’m not sure why no one has ever come up with a rhythm-action game before, but <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> oozes charm, attitude, and personality. I love everything about the look of this game, from the bright aesthetic, the selection of music, to the rocking original compositions. So why on earth haven’t I played this yet?</p>
<p>I admit, it’s because I <em>thought</em> this would come to Switch, but after Tango Gameworks was shut down — then saved from the brink – I think we’re in for a shot on Switch 2. After all, we all deserve to spend time with 808 and Chai, right? <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Hotel Barcelona</h2>

<p>This collaboration between SWERY and Suda51 is one of the most exciting-looking games on any system in my book. I have no idea if the end result will live up to the trailer's showcasing of the creators' patented weirdness (and those side-on bits admittedly look a little rote), but I'd love to find out on a Switch. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Immortality</h2>

<p>We can already play Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/telling_lies">Telling Lies</a> on Switch 2 via backwards compatibility, and if there's no chance of Sam Barlow's <strong>Her Story</strong> making a return, Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/immortality">Immortality</a> — a fascinating lost-footage mystery game that launched to great acclaim elsewhere in 2022 — would be a super sub.</p>
<p>I also think it's time for the Sid Meier-isation of Sam Barlow. Get your name on the game, Sam. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>

<p>I expected this one to be a damp squib, given the initial trailers and Microsoft's run of luck the last couple of years, so it was a welcome surprise to hear that, actually, the first-person Indy game was good. Great, even! It's out on PS5 already, and Microsoft is keen to put games on any device that'll run 'em, and this would be the <em>perfect</em> present to enjoy over the holidays this year.</p>
<p>You know, maybe it makes <em>too much</em> sense. Hopefully I haven't jinxed it. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>

<p>I didn't have time to check out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/kingdom_come_deliverance_ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> when it arrived on the beefier consoles earlier in the year, but good god, does it look like the kind of game that would swallow up <em>all</em> of my time.</p>
<p>A knight sim RPG where you have to actually practice skills to get good at them? It might be one of the most attention-intensive gaming experiences out there at the moment, so just imagine it on the go. Hey, the first one worked well enough on Switch! <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Lumines Arise</h2>

<p>Oh man, I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumines_remastered">Lumines</a> so much. If I’m out and about and I have my Vita or Switch on me, but I can’t think of anything to play, then I’ll often default to Lumines. It’s just such an immediately satisfying experience and you can make runs last for bloomin’ ages if you’re good enough.</p>
<p>With the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_effect_connected">Tetris Effect</a> creating this latest entry, I’ve got high hopes that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> will be an absolute banger. Frankly, it belongs on the Switch, but you can bet that until that day comes, I’ll be rinsing it on the PS5. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>

<p>Free-to-play hero shooters are a dime a dozen these days, but it takes something special to last more than a couple of months. NetEase found that secret sauce with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and the only thing stopping me from playing with every waking moment, for a time, was that I wasn't near my PS5. Let me at it on the go, and those played hours will soon be racking up even more.</p>
<p>Actually, maybe it's best for me if this one <em>doesn't</em> come to Switch 2... <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</h2>

<p>So far, it seems <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> is destined to be a PS5 and Windows exclusive. Heck, Sony even has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTGmg6uYXKc">slick new fight stick</a> lined up, which it’s clearly marketing in conjunction with the game.</p>
<p>But still, it looks <em>ridiculously</em> good… If this spells the end for <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom</strong>, then so be it. Arc System Works is a superb developer, and it’s made some truly spectacular fighting games. I need this on the Switch 2, Sony. Please. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</h2>

<p>Of all the games I've spoken about here, I think <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/mass_effect_legendary_edition">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> is one that will defo come to Switch 2, if circumstances at Bioware were better. It's just too important not to have on every system, goddamnit!</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of folk have played the trilogy already, but it has a special place regardless, it's one of the all-time greats and we need to ensure the children know of the legendary Shepard and his (or her) sexy companions. I shouldn't have mentioned the sexy companions. I'm gonna have to download it again now. Please put it on Switch 2 so I can have it in my lap. <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>

<p>Atlus and Sega have shown a lot of love for the Switch 2 already, so there’s no way <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is skipping Nintendo. And in my eyes, this is the best game Atlus has ever made.</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s a distillation of everything Atlus has ever done. There’s <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>MegaTen</strong> aplenty here, but also a heavy dose of <strong>Etrian Odyssey</strong> and a sprinkling of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine</a>. But It’s also a refinement of the push-turn combat with a whole job system on top. Beyond all that, Metaphor actually has something to say and feels like the most poignant, relevant RPG in some time. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...</h2>

<p>I'm relatively surprised we haven't already seen <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/nier_replicant_ver_1_22474487139">NieR Replicant</a> (no, I'm not writing the full title out here) on Switch, so I'd like to think Square Enix will give Yoko Taro even more money by putting this sublime and messy predecessor on Switch 2.</p>
<p>NieR Replicant isn't always fun to play — that's kind of the point — but it is a beautifully, meticulously-crafted story with incredible characters and music. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll freak out, and you'll experience emotional gut punches unmatched in the medium. Plus you get to meet Kainé and Emil, two of the best video game characters ever. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>

<p>Okay, so I don’t know for sure if <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is going to be worth playing. After all, PlatinumGames' track record hasn't always been perfect and, in my opinion, it dropped the ball somewhat with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>. Regardless, the team has supported the Switch so much over the years, it feels weird to not see Ninja Gaiden 4 on Switch 2 (granted, the decision likely lies solely with Koei Tecmo, but still).</p>
<p>It doesn’t look like the most graphically-intensive game imaginable, so I reckon PlatinumGames could just about make it work on Nintendo’s latest console. Nailing the frame rate would be key, though, so I’m happy to give them all the time in the world to get it right. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>

<p>This surely has to be happening, right? <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, as much as it can feel like a chore at times, is also just one of the bonafide bangers of our time. Even just for the hunting I'm in for the long haul, never mind the epic, sprawling, and almost relentlessly emotional western saga that sits alongside all the shooting chipmunks for their lustrous pelts.</p>
<p>Stick this one on Switch 2, in a decent port, which seems like something that should be more than feasible at this point in the game's life (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">there's even been rumours</a>), and we're looking at one of the great handheld experiences out there. <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Resident Evils 7, 8, 9</h2>

<p>Before you say anything, no, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">Resident Evil 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_village_cloud">8</a> are not on the Switch – Cloud Versions don’t count! So yes, proper native Switch 2 ports would do quite nicely, thank you very much. Given that both came out on the PS4 and Xbox One, I think the Switch 2 would be more than capable of running them adequately, but I’m not quite so confident about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming ninth entry looks quite a bit more accomplished in terms of visuals, so I think Capcom would probably need to do a bit of tinkering to get it running on the Switch 2. It’s still early days yet, though – let’s see another trailer first. Oh, and while I’m at it, let’s get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_3_-_cloud_version">3</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">4</a> remakes over too. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>

<p>Bloober Team has experienced a lot of fluctuating appraisals over the years, but it’s safe to say that its remake of Team Silent and Konami’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> was pretty exceptional. It got almost everything right, from the story to the atmosphere, and even the gameplay was pretty solid too, minus some frustrating moments of repetition.</p>
<p>So yes, take all the time you need, Bloober Team, but let’s get Silent Hill 2 running on the Switch 2, please. Add in some gyro aiming, maybe some spooky HD Rumble effects, and you’re onto a winner. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>System Shock</h2>

<p>We recently saw the recent remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> on the Switch, but Nightdive Studio’s full-on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">remake of the first entry</a> is another beast entirely. It’s got such a cool visual design, utilising pixel art textures but with modern lighting and effects. It’s like HD-2D but… not, y’know?</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s a truly exceptional title and I’d love to see it on the Switch 2 with gyro aiming and all the other stuff Nightdive is so good at. There are rumours that it could also be giving System Shock 2 the same treatment, so yeah, let’s get that too! <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Vanquish</h2>

<p>I will try to get <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/vanquish">Vanquish</a> on every system I can, and I'll mention it in every list they let me, because I like to watch men chain smoke.</p>
<p>I also like to play really great action games, from the best action-game-makers in the biz no less, that let me slide around in a jazzy robot suit whilst blowing ribbons out of loads of crazy big mecha enemies. It's delicious. It's also exactly the sort of game that would have had the Switch 1 spitting flames out its exhaust port. Switch 2, though? It could take it. They could even add extra stuff. Mario-branded cigarettes, anyone?PJ</p>
</div><div><h2>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</h2>

<p>I’ve watched my husband play a fair number of <strong>Yakuza / Like A Dragon</strong> games at this point, but I’ve never properly played myself, despite <em>loving</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> and enjoying the Dondoko Island aspect of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_infinite_wealth">Infinite Wealth</a>.</p>
<p>Truly, I’m waiting for an excuse, and it’s specifically for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> (or Yakuza 7… it’s complicated) to come to Switch 2. You <em>know</em> I love turn-based RPGs and a good story, and this is the LaD with both. I just want to spend a good time with my <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>-loving Yakuza, Ichiban… <em>AH</em></p>
</div></div><hr>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-gears-of-war-reloaded-emerging-on-ps5-soon-will-it-support-crossplay.1271808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The <i>Gears of War </i>franchise has a long history as one of Xbox’s most beloved properties, but the times are changing. Though it has seen life on PC in the past, <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> marks the time the series has made the move to a Sony platform. Yep, this substantial remaster of the first game in the franchise is finally available on PS5 (as well as Xbox and PC) with all the bells and whistles you’d expect, so it’s time to pick up a chainsaw and start chewing through the Locust horde.</p> <p>If you’d like to go online with <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i>, however, you’ll probably want to link up with your gaming posse. Blasting bodies apart with shotguns is better with friends, after all. So, let’s see if <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> has crossplay support and whether or not you can carry your progress between platforms.</p>  <p>If you’re looking to jump into gory gunfights together with friends, I’ve got some really great news for you! <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> offers full cross-play support</b>, meaning you can team up with anyone across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ecosystems. Regardless of platform, you’ll all need to be signed into your Microsoft accounts to make this happen, but <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account">that’s easy enough to set up</a>.</p>

 <p>Crossplay is available for both co-op and competitive multiplayer modes, so you and some friends are free to tackle the campaign or frag nerds online. But whatever you do, just don’t kill me. I’m really bad at <i>Gears</i> multiplayer, so you have to be nice. Mom said so.</p> <h2>Does <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>In another twist of good news in a world filled with bad news, <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> also supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, your progress can transfer between any platform on which you own the game. So, if you started on PC and decided you wanted to swap over to PS5, that’d be no problem at all! You’d just need to re-buy the game on Sony’s platform, and then you can pick up right where you left off.</p> <p>Cross-progression works for both your campaign and multiplayer progress, so you’ll lose nothing when swapping back and forth. Again, you’ll need a Microsoft account to use this feature, but that’s to be expected.</p> <hr> <p><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> is available August 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-save-progression-ps5-xbox-2000618072]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The U.S. state of Louisiana is suing Roblox, alleging it facilitates "the sexual exploitation of Louisiana's children".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">statement</a>, Louisiana Attorney General, Liz Murrill, claimed Roblox "endangers the safety of the children" of the state, writing: "Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritises user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety.</p>
<p>"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home."</p>
<p>The legal papers then names several "highly inappropriate" Roblox mini games such as Escape to Epstein Island, Public Bathroom Simulator, and Diddy Party.</p>
<p>"These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape. A recent report even revealed a group of 3,334 members openly traded child pornography and solicited sexual acts from minors," the Louisiana announcement says, <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">citing a 2024 report</a>.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Roblox is violating Louisiana law - choosing profits over child safety. It's basically open season for sex predators on this platform. <a href="https://t.co/fGSQ8IFgWw">pic.twitter.com/fGSQ8IFgWw</a></p>— Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956343934877090064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The lawsuit claims that while Roblox requires children to have permission from their parents or guardians to open an account, the company "does nothing to confirm or document that parental permission has been given, no matter how young a child is. Nor does Defendant require a parent to confirm the age given when a child signs up to use Roblox".</p>
<p>"[Roblox] has access to biometric age verification software that requires the user to take a photo of a government-issued ID along with a real-time selfie photo that is then verified through artificial intelligence," the AG adds. "However, while Defendant utilises this software for other purposes, Defendant intentionally does not utilise this feature when new accounts are created."</p>
<p>In a press conference announcing the lawsuit, Murrill said: "So [Roblox] have chosen profits over child safety. It's basically open season for sex predators on this app. For this reason, and all of the others that we've talked about today, Roblox is violating Louisiana law, and that's why we filed this lawsuit."</p>
<p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsui">said</a> it does not comment on pending litigation, but stressed "it would like to address erroneous claims and misconceptions about our platform, our commitment to safety, and our overall safety track record".</p>
<p>"Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn STEM skills, play, and imagine, and have a safe experience on our platform. Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue. No system is perfect, and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users."</p><p>It added that it is constantly innovating safety tools and launching new safeguards, has taken an industry-leading stance on age-based communication, and serves players of which 64 percent are aged 13 or over. It also dedicates substantial resources to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behaviour, and collaborates with law enforcement and government agencies, as well as mental health organisations, child safety organisations, and parental advocacy groups "to keep users safe on the platform".</p>
<p>"We know safety is critically important to families, and we strive to empower our community of parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children. This includes a suite of easy-to-use parental controls to provide parents with more control and clarity on what their kids and teens are doing on Roblox," the statement concludes.</p>
<p>"We aim to create one of the safest online environments for users, a goal not only core to our founding values but contrary to certain assertions, one we believe is critical to our long-term vision and success. We understand there is always more work to be done, and we are committed to making Roblox a safe and positive environment for all users."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes quirky platformers with a whole lot of charm and whimsy, you may have your eyes set on <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i>. In this bizarre 3D platformer, you’re cast as the titular character who possesses the ability to copy and paste textures, allowing you to change the world around you to solve puzzles and reach new areas.</p> <p><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> can be a whole lot of fun if you’re able to brave its frenetic gameplay and art style. But you may be wondering how long it’ll take you to reach the end of this rowdy adventure and how much extra content there is to dive into. Let’s answer that for you below.</p> <p><b>If you’re just mainlining </b><b><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i></b><b>‘s campaign, you can likely reach the end of the game in about 6-8 hours</b>. This makes it notably shorter than some similar 3D platformers, but its wacky gameplay and clever puzzles ensure that not a moment is wasted. Even so, you may wish for a few extra hours when you realize how brief the main quest is, especially if you really click with the Swap ability and enjoy blasting textures all over the map.</p>

 <p>Luckily, there are a lot of optional things to do in <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> that can extend your time with the game, especially if you’re aiming to obtain all of its trophies or achievements. You’ll need to find a variety of optional secrets and collectibles, as well as swap textures over a thousand times. But given that a large part of the gameplay loop involves the Swap ability, you’ll be well on your way to that one anyway.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to push through the campaign or track down every secret, you can get started doing so right away. <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fairgame-has-been-canceled-too-according-to-michael-pachter-who-says-sony-has-%E2%80%98lost-its-way%E2%80%99.1271772/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter is back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WuLcrpCkkc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with another episode of his Pachter Factor podcast</a>, and he brings some interesting news: Fairgame$ might have been canceled. </p>



<p>While discussing Sony's switch toward live service games, which he criticized because of wrong moves such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying Bungie for a lot more than they were worth in his opinion</a>, the analyst casually said that Jade Raymond had been let go and her game, titled Fairgame$, canceled. </p>



<p><em>Sony went, "Oh, we need some of that", except that they bought Bungie to do it." Bungie made Halo. They're obviously very talented. They made Destiny. Destiny was good. It had ongoing in-game spend. But they paid 3.6 billion for it. They didn't buy a mobile publisher like Scopely for 4.9 billion, which has 3 billion or 3.5 billion of revenue. Bungie has 300 million in revenue. They didn't buy Niantic, which has 1.5 billion of revenue. They didn't buy people who know how to make live service games. And then they turned all their console developers into live service developers, which resulted in Concord being shut down and the studio being shut down. Which resulted in Jade Raymond being let go and her game Fairgame$ cancelled. </em></p>



<p>Raymond's departure from Haven Studio (which she <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-jade-raymond-haven-new-playstation-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded</a> in 2021) was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in May, but we only learned back then that the game had been delayed from 2025 to 2026. Fairgame$ has been described as a 'competitive heist experience' in development for both PlayStation 5 and PC. Needless to say, if this cancellation were to be confirmed, it would be another major blow to Sony's foray into the live service category, after the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Online</a>.</p>



<p>In his podcast episode, Pachter directly attacked Sony, arguing that they have lost their way and 'don't know what they are doing' anymore.</p>



<p><em>They are bad managers. They don't know what they're doing.</em> <em>They should do what they're good at and they should buy what they're not good at. And so to buy what you're not good at means you don't buy Bungie, because Bungie makes console games. Sony's good at that. Buy King, buy Zinga, buy Supercell, buy Peak Games, buy somebody who knows how to make live service free-to-play games. Buy Respawn. We didn't know that Vince Zampella could do it, but he did. But no, I think Sony has lost its way.</em></p>



<p>For its part, Sony recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-admits-live-service-push-isnt-going-smoothly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that its live service efforts haven't gone smoothly, but it also promised to learn from its mistakes.</p>

              <p>If you look at <i>Ratshaker</i> on the PlayStation store, you might be inclined to write it off as one of hundreds of shovelware games on storefronts designed for easy trophies. I know I did at first. But then, I saw the game gaining traction across multiple subreddits where plenty of users seemed to agree that it’s actually a surreal horror title worth the low cost of entry — I checked it out. I’m glad I did.</p> <p>While <i>Ratshaker</i> may have a low-res visual style, brief runtime, and fairly easy trophy list, it manages to rise above the trappings of shovelware to be something that diehard horror fans can appreciate. The game tasks you with, well, shaking and squeezing a rat to solve some basic adventure-style puzzles around a home where something horrible has happened. Yeah, it’s fucking weird.</p> <p>But while <i>Ratshaker</i>‘s simple premise initially leans toward being quirky and funny in its delivery, don’t let that fool you. As you further explore the home and peel back what happened there, <i>Ratshaker</i> reveals some truly unnerving events that may stick in your head for a while. If that sounds up your alley, here’s how long it’ll take you to beat this bizarre experience.</p>

 <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Ratshaker</i>?</h2> <p><i>Ratshaker</i> is a cheap game with a short runtime, so you shouldn’t go in expecting an epic adventure. Instead, <b>you’re treated to an immensely strange horror mystery that will take about an hour to unravel</b>. But the brief time you spend with <i>Ratshaker</i> will feel like enough. It’s a game that doesn’t <i>need</i> much time to tell its story, which ends up far more unsettling than you may expect, even after engaging with its disturbing opening.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618068">© Screenshot: Sunscorched Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re also playing <i>Ratshaker</i> for its fairly easy platinum trophy, be aware that there are missable trophies throughout the adventure. And you’ll technically need to see both the real ending and a secret ending to earn the platinum trophy, but you can do both on one playthrough if you manage your saves right. Following a guide can help you not miss out on these trophies if you’re not eager to play <i>Ratshaker</i> twice.</p> <p>Even if you’re not seeking the easy platinum trophy, I’d argue that the low price and ominous vibes make <i>Ratshaker</i> a good grab for any horror fan who appreciates weird shit. It’s available now on PS5 and Windows PCs, with a release on additional platforms planned for later this summer. Shake that rat.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-take%E2%80%99s-best-scares-come-from-real-life-performances.1271745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Dead Take</em>, the second game from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></em> developer Surgent Studios, is a quiet horror game where the monster is ambition and the lengths a person will go for stardom. Like a lot of horror games, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/695811/verso-and-astarion-walk-into-a-video-game">Dead Take</a></em> relies on jumpscares to get the heart pumping. But playing this game, my deepest, most upsetting scares didn’t come from the startle of a sudden knock but from the performances of the game’s actors.</p><p>In <em>Dead Take</em>, you play as Chase Lowry (Neil Newbon), a struggling actor who has come to the creepy mansion of Hollywood producer and kingmaker Duke Cain (Abubakar Salim), to look for his friend, Vinnie Monroe (Ben Starr), another struggling actor. The game mixes the exploration and puzzle solving gameplay of a <em>Resident Evil</em> game with a narrative delivered almost entirely via full motion video cutscenes, or known to us Olds as FMVs. I know FMV games have been around for a while, but this is my first, it felt novel in a way video games hadn’t made me feel in a long time.</p><p>As you journey through the mansion, the main thrust of the game is piecing together what happened to your friend Vinny. You do that through finding snippets of videos — interviews, auditions, and video messages — and splicing them together to create wholly new videos through the use of a fancy schmancy AI editor. These new videos reveal plot elements and puzzle solutions which all sound rather like the normal course of a video game until you realize these performers are acting their <em>asses off</em>.</p><p>Throughout <em>Dead Take</em>, you watch Vinnie try to secure a role in Duke Cain’s next big picture, something he is hungry to the point of desperation for. When a concerned call from Chase interrupts an audition, and Duke questions Vinnie’s commitment, Vinnie brutally insults Chase.</p><p>I like to inhabit the characters I play in video games. After all, they’re mostly blank slates on which you can project your own thoughts and feelings. The character you pilot becomes a proxy for you even when they have their own personalities. I can’t do that in <em>Dead Take</em>.</p><p>Watching real, flesh and blood people act is so much more engrossing than hearing them act with the action mapped onto polygonal bodies. I played both <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23818692/baldurs-gate-3-starting-guide-tips-how-to">Baldur’s Gate III</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">Final Fantasy XVI</a></em>, in which Newbon and Starr gave excellent performances. But watching them act, they’re on another level.</p><p><sub>This is only a sample of what to expect from Starr.</sub></p><p>Starr <em>scared </em>me in this game. A couple of jumpscares got me real good, and even the quiet, unsettling mansion created an atmosphere where I literally jumped at my own shadow, but Ben Starr is the scariest thing in this game. There’s a moment when, during yet another audition take, he starts screaming at his costar like Christian Bale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090205081725/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bale-turns-american-psycho-with-expletiveladen-tantrum-on-set-1544988.html">that one time</a>. It was so well done, so reminiscent of all the times I’ve had run-ins with violent, abusive men, that I forgot he was acting.</p><p>Not all the performances are bone-chilling depictions of what it’s like selling your soul to become the next big thing. There’s some humor in there too. Sam Lake, known for his work (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-alan-wake-2-herald-of-darkness-1851085691">and dance moves</a>) on Remedy’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Alan Wake</em> series</a>, gives a hilarious appearance playing a washed up director. Because of plot shenanigans, Ben Starr and Neil Newbon are two British men, playing American actors pretending to be southern, and it is quite funny when those three-layers-deep accents occasionally break.</p><p>But don’t get me wrong, this game is all about the scares. Without FMVs, <em>Dead Take</em> would be a perfectly fine but forgettable game. Through the use of technology that peaked in the days of the LaserDisc, it’s become one of my favorite horror games ever. I don’t mind horror games, but I don’t seek them out. I’m glad I sought out <em>Dead Take</em>.<br><sub><em>Dead Take</em> is out now on Steam.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760213/dead-take-review-fmv-horror-game-ben-starr]]></content:encoded>
