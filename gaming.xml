This follows an update last week to the music app which added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a> soundtrack.</p>

<p>This bumps it from 1.0.0 up to <strong>Version 1.0.1</strong>. According to the official patch notes, it resolves multiple issues to enhance the overall gameplay experience. It we find out what exactly is going on behind the scenes with this update, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>For now, here is the official rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>

<p>"Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience."</p>

<hr>
<p>Whether we'll see this game get any significant content updates in the future is unclear at this stage, but at the moment, it seems Nintendo will at least be patching any issues discovered.</p>
<p>This follows an update for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last week. Nintendo has also rolled out some Switch game updates today for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Welcome Tour on the Switch 2 yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We actually thought it was surprisingly delightful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/yu-gi-oh">anime</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/yu-gi-oh">video games</a>, or the card game itself, Yu-Gi-Oh has been a pop culture staple for over 25 years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, it remains one of the most popular and enduring trading card games on the planet, and whether you're chasing meta-defining staples or just looking to fill out your binder with something flashy, the high-value cards always demand attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 has taken a breather compared to last year’s chaos. Prices are down, panic-buying has cooled, and both duelists and collectors are feeling the benefits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But make no mistake, there are still plenty of premium pulls hidden in Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 releases. Between <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OGB8?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Supreme Darkness</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xpqW?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alliance Insight</a>, we've seen the final wave of Quarter Century Secret Rares. And just this past week, Starlight Rares officially returned to the TCG, turning heads and inflating wishlists overnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, since we're halfway through 2025, I've been busy taking stock of the most valuable cards you can still pull from Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 boosters. It's time to d-d-d-duel!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10. Mulcharmy Purulia</strong></h3><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223410"><div id="223410" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mulcharmy Purulia</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This reprint of Mulcharmy Purulia is pretty pricey these days, reaching around $100 right now after its printing in Maxze of the Master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has started to level off, but it was a sharp climb just a couple of months ago.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9. Mitsurugui Ritual </strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223411"><div id="223411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mitsurugui Ritual </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $90 at the time of asking, this spell card is a dream for reptile-focused decks. The Supreme Darkness Quarter Century Super Rare version has recently dropped from $120 to $90, but it’s still expensive.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8. Maiden of White</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223412"><div id="223412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maiden of White</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you managed to grab the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbJWb?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue-Eyes White Destiny</a> structure deck, then good news – many of its cards are pretty pricey to get these days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maiden of White is going for around $90-100 right now, with first editions climbing to the $120s.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7. Paladins of Bonds and Unity</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223413"><div id="223413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Paladins of Bonds and Unity</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As TCGPlayer explains, Paladins of Bonds and Unity is perhaps less useful to play with and more of a collector’s edition. That art is gorgeous, and it’s going for around $100 on the secondary market (although some are asking for more).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Maliss P March Hare</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223414"><div id="223414" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maliss P March Hare</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It never takes long for Yu-Gi-Oh cards to devolve into made-up words and random letters, but this one is worth checking your packs for. In fact, it’s the most valuable Secret Rare from this year’s Alliance Insight set.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. Dragon Master Lords</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223415"><div id="223415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Master Lords</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A 5000 attack and defense creature that can’t be targeted by card effects? Where do we sign? This XYZ creature is essentially a one-card wincon, but it won’t come cheap.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. A Bao A Qu, the Lightless Shadow</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223416"><div id="223416" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>A Bao A Qu, the Lightless Shadow</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember what we said about words and letters? This link-summoned monster can bring in monsters while disrupting your opponent nicely. Destroy a card and bring in your own? We’re sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we’ll need to get saving – it reaches over $130 at present.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3. Rimite Dragon Ether Beryl</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223417"><div id="223417" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rimite Dragon Ether Beryl</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t expect this badass dragon to be called Beryl, but this isn’t one to be laughed at. It’ll set you back $150 right now for its Monster Mayhem version, and it plays very, very nicely with Blue-Eyes White Dragon decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223418"><div id="223418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve enjoyed anything Yu-Gi-Oh over the years, you’ll know this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice’s core stats are hardly awe-inspiring, collectors love her (I wonder why?) so her Quarter Century Secret Rare from <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xpqW?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alliance Insight</a> is fetching up to $170 right now at TCGPlayer and other secondary markets like eBay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a lot of cash considering her <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgpLw?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret Rare counterpart is just under $10 market</a> right now as well, but who am I to judge?</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1. Mulcharmy Meowls</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223419"><div id="223419" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mulcharmy Meowls</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorry Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice, your artwork is no longer the cutest on this list. The most valuable card of 2025 is the truly adorable Mulcharmy Meowls, which is going for upwards of $200.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Honorable Mention: Battles of Legend: Monster Mayhem</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223473"><div id="223473" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Battles of Legend: Monster Mayhem</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Galatea-i, the Orcust Automaton</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it’s too soon to draw any hard conclusions for the time being. These early prices are often inflated by hype, and the market tends to shift quickly. We'll be keeping a close eye on where these cards land once the dust settles, and the other eye on Duelist's Advance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find Valuable Yu-Gi-Oh Cards in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So your best bet of owning any of the above is simply through the secondary market, and buying individual cards standalone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, if you are in it for the love of the game, and fancy fleecing out for some shiny boosters in an attempt to pull some of the rarest cards going, this is where you can buy the latest 2025 Yu-Gi-Oh booster bundles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've mentioned the highest price sold as well, alongside the current listing price at the time of publication,so you have a good idea what the market is looking like at the moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch updates?

<p>The following issues have been fixed in Nintendo Switch 2 system version 20.1.5, released on June 18, 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a Nintendo Switch 2 player and a Nintendo Switch player were matched up in online play, the match may have ended immediately if someone was using a Mii Fighter.</li>

<p>Nintendo originally acknowledged this update following the Switch 2's system firmware update last week. It's also been working on resolving more issues tied to Switch backwards compatibility over the past month.</p>
<p>Apart from Smash Ultimate, Nintendo has also updated the Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> today, bumping it up to Version 1.4.1. According to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27783/kw/super%20mario%20odyssey">official patch notes for this one</a>, several issues have been addressed to improve the overall gameplay experience on the Switch 2.</p>

The studio has been forced to delay the remaster's PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch release, but - good-ish news time - only by a couple of weeks as it seeks to remedy undisclosed "issues".
</p>
<p>
Nightdive announced it would be remastering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>, but it wasn't until earlier this year that the project got a new name (it's now officially known as the System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster) and a 26th June release date for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, the studio has now announced a short delay for the console versions in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nightdivestudios.bsky.social/post/3lsclg2v6o22p">statement on social media</a>, saying it has "encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles... on 26th June as originally intended." Nightdive adds that it's "currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible", but that the console release is now "targeting the first two weeks of July."

<p>
As for the PC version, that's managed to retain its 26th June release date and will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a> on 26th June as originally announced. "We'll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles," Nightdive's statement concludes.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, which follows on from 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.
</p>
<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2 released in the hazy days of 1999, taking players onboard the FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114 for another battle of wits with rogue AI SHODAN. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," Nightdive explains. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!), "It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced... and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a meeting of the minds that is shocking only in its capacity to surprise anyone at this point, current and <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon-to-be-former</a> <a href="https://defector.com/the-most-unbelievable-bits-from-nyc-mayor-eric-adamss-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced NYC mayor</a> Eric Adams recently sat down with Kai Cenat, one of the most-watched streamers on Twitch and probably the most famous from a mainstream perspective. The latter, a Bronx native, attempted to host an in-person PS5 giveaway in 2023, which – to give you an idea of how that went – has its own Wikipedia page titled “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Union_Square_riot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Union Square riot</a>.” Now, fresh off the success of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/kai-cenat-streamer-university-what-happened.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamer University’s more contained chaos</a> and on the verge of hosting another giveaway, Cenat has some misgivings about how the NYPD treated him and his friends.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxwcFDYKoL8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> promoting the upcoming second giveaway, Cenat asked Adams how he could avoid another disastrous outcome. After the two exchanged pleasantries – with Adams granting that every day in New York is “crazy,” <a href="https://defector.com/eric-adams-the-beauty-of-new-york-is-that-there-are-terrorist-attacks-and-also-stores-that-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as is his wont</a> – Cenat, who until recently resided in Atlanta, Georgia and has since departed for another undisclosed city, explained why he got the sense that he’s no longer welcome in NYC. In short, Cenat feels like the police continued to bother him and his friends even in 2024, after the 2023 riot incident was resolved.</p><p>"[NYPD] be picking on us in a way,” Cenat told Adams, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/30/new-york-city-council-criminal-justice-reform-bills-00138644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a notoriously pro-cop mayor</a> who was once an NYPD captain himself. “In terms of a lot of times where police was doing things that they wasn't supposed to be doing. It made it feel like NYPD was a gang at one point. My friend [Roberto] Fanum [Gonzalez] got his car taken away for no reason [in 2024]."</p><p>Adams then asked if the NYPD impounded the car on the same day as the riot, to which Cenat replied that it had happened on "a whole different day." The incident Cenat described was, indeed, alarming, with an officer <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/alex-ocho/fanum-lamborghini-seized-gun-pointed-nypd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing a gun at Gonzalez</a> after last summer's Bronx Dominican Parade and handcuffing him. Police proceeded to take the car, a purple Lamborghini Urus, on the basis that, as a rep later told Complex, the vehicle lacked license plates. However, Gonzalez claimed on social media that he'd received a permit for the purposes of the parade. Additionally, pictures surfaced that seemed to depict <a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1817726076715753556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officers posing with the car</a>.</p><p>“The police would just look at us and pick us out,” Cenat told Adams. “We had trouble the whole summer [of 2024]. … I kinda feel like coming to New York, it’ll be kinda hectic in terms of, I gotta move a certain way.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response, Adams suddenly brought up one of the handful of things <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-mayor-adams-rats-99649a7a4ec4003e8ec5ca551d90ed25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s declared</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/eric-adams-nyc-trash-wheelie-bins-b2576182.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">war on</a> during his time as mayor: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mayor-eric-adams-drill-rap-1299108/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drill rap</a>.</p><p>"We've come a long way from where we were,” Adams said, never clarifying which time period he was referring to. “And what's happening now even in the Bronx, there's a lot of crews, a lot of folks getting into battles over drill music. They're disrespecting each others' community. And so, I have to find that right balance. I've got to make sure we're safe, but not with disgrace."</p><p>“Yeah,” replied Cenat, “I just feel like there were some points where, you know, it’ll be the cops taking the car and posing with it, and we’re basically getting laughed at. So, us being from New York, we felt some type of way in terms of, like, we can’t even embrace the city without something going on because of how big we are. We always have a radar every time we fly in. It was always something.”</p><p>Of the car incident, Adams then asked the question on everybody’s mind: “What did [police] take it for? Was he drag racing?”</p><p>Cenat, perhaps more prepared for Adams’ jazz-like stream-of-consciousness approach to conversation than Adams – who loves putting on a show but hates doing his homework – was for anything involving Cenat and his friends, somehow did not miss a beat: “No,” he said, “he wasn’t doing nothing.”</p><p>“OK,” Adams finally resolved, “we need to look at that.”</p><p>Cenat and Adams’ discussion of the 2023 riot and the upcoming giveaway was comparatively brief. The riot, which took place in August 2023, stemmed from a comedy of errors. Cenat and fellow mega-famous content creators like Gonzalez and Duke Dennis failed to obtain a permit for a gathering that ended up drawing thousands, who grew increasingly unruly as what was billed as PS5 giveaway collapsed under its own weight. A small handful of fans were injured, and 65 were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews/post/influencer-kai-cenat-playstation-giveaway-riot-new-york-charges-have-now-been-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a>. Police yanked Cenat out of the ensuing chaos and hit him with charges of inciting a riot and unlawful assembly, though the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/us/kai-cenat-union-square-giveaway-riot-charge-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charges were dropped</a> after Cenat paid $55,000 in restitution fees and <a href="https://people.com/twitch-star-kai-cenat-wont-face-charges-after-nyc-riot-8646247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an apology</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/domainsdomain/status/1689433483058257921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decried fans’ actions</a> shortly after shit hit the fan. This is not to say that Cenat’s moral compass was rendered infallible by the lessons he learned on that fateful day; during the aforementioned Streamer University, for example, Cenat and friends palled around with and consistently praised YouTuber and rapper DDG, who has been <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/halle-bailey-ddg-restraining-order.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of physical and emotional abuse</a> in a restraining order filed by his ex, singer and actress Halle Bailey.</p><p>During the recent conversation with Adams, Cenat, cognizant of damage done by his previous event, asked if there was a way he could more safely run it back. Adams replied by pointing to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, a boxing event so wonky that one of its main fighters, Ryan Garcia, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2025/5/3/24422840/ryan-garcia-compares-times-square-fight-experience-to-weird-fever-dream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially blamed</a> its walled-off setup for his loss, but which nonetheless <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45009726/an-look-day-boxing-took-new-york-s-square" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformed a portion of Times Square into a boxing arena</a> without descending into a riot.</p><p>"Let's look at what we just did two weeks ago,” said Adams. “We had a major, major boxing event right in the middle of Times Square. A couple hundred thousand people were there. They coordinated with the city. ... You can't still do [events] on the level you did before because now you've blown up. So now you have to do it on another level. You sit down with my team. I get the agencies involved. You map out what your plan is: ‘This is what I want to do. I want to do something to give back.’ Now you've got the city in alignment to make sure you can execute the plan."</p><p>Cenat found these terms agreeable, saying that he simply wants to “give back” to his home city after botching his first attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>He then returned to the more pressing matter at hand: “Is there a way that my friend like Fanum could probably get an apology for what happened or anything like that?”</p><p>Adams, initially confused, reiterated that he’ll look into it, and then, “if something was done wrong, [Fanum] will get an apology.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cenat then turned his attention to one last major concern:&nbsp;</p><p>"How do you get the key to the city or, like, a street sign?” he asked. “I just want to see Cenat Ave, or something like that."</p><p>“I’m looking to have Eric Ave,” Adams said, before explaining that City Council names streets, while Adams can indeed bestow the key to the city upon a worthy recipient, but only for their life’s work.</p><p>"That’ll be fire to get," said Cenat. "I just wanted to get the greenlight if I ever wanted to run back an event or run back something like [if] I can. Because, right now, I didn't know if I was able to run any event back to give back to New York because of what happened last time."</p><p>“Do it right,” Adams replied.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Cenat, “we'll do it right.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been an eventful news day for fans of adorably sinister horror series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>. Not only has the upcoming third instalment received a 10th October release date on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and  - as newly confirmed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, publisher Bandai Namco has announced an Enhanced Edition of the original game, <em>and</em> a brand-new VR instalment.
</p>
<p>
Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, which seems as good a place as any to start, promises a bit of a glow-up for developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed 2017 original. This time around, players can experience raincoat-wearing protagonist Six's strange, dark escape from the mysterious, floating Maw at 4K resolution and 60fps. There's also talk of "RTX reflections, water effects, more particles, and volumetric lighting", plus a choice between Quality and Performance modes, depending on whether you prefer to prioritise visuals or framerate.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco has given Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition an official launch date of 10th October, but it's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now for anyone that pre-orders developer Supermassive Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. Switch 2 is also getting the Enhanced Edition, but not until October.
</p>

<p>
As for that VR version, it's title Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes and... that's pretty much all we know so far. Bandai Namco is yet to confirm a developer, even the platforms it's targeting, but we do get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CvZB0nFaoE">45-second announcement trailer</a> to tide us over. "Every step echoes closer," the publisher teases, "does this tune sound familiar, little ones?" Also promising is the newly teased Little Nightmares stop-motion project, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Bandai%20Namco">looks eerily beautiful in its brisk reveal trailer</a>, although there's no hint as to when or even <em>where</em> this might eventually show up. Is it related to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightmare-before-christmas-director-bringing-little-nightmares-to-tv">Little Nightmares TV show announced back in 2017</a>? Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
So to recap: Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is out now for those that pre-order Little Nightmares 3, otherwise both games launch on 10th October. Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes, meanwhile, exists, and there's not much else to say. As to what original Little Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios is up to now, having walked away from the series after part 2, that'll be Reanimal. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-studios-reanimal-is-more-kids-in-dark-places-but-now-with-co-op">another kids-in-dark-places horror adventure</a> (but with added co-op) that's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC later this year.

            <p>
I love fishing in games. I already went over this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-fishing-is-a-horror-fishing-sim-with-only-one-goal-reel-in-the-one-thing-that-was-never-meant-to-be-found">last week with Out Fishing</a>, so I won't repeat myself much more. But I do desperately need to tell you about FISH³, or FISH³: FISHTASTIC FISHING FISHSCAPES, a very unconventional fishing game that's also an arcade time trial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a>, where the fish you catch are also your boat's engine, and you can fish while you're racing? If, like me, that entire description has you thinking "come again", then read on.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
So, here's how it works. Levels start off with you catching a fish, which involves moving your analogue sticks (controller only it seems, sorry mouse and keyboard diehards) into particular spots and hitting L2 and R2 to build up some meter to catch it. The racing part itself is akin to something like Wave Race 64, with ramps and nets to give you boosts and get in your way along the course.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuLeChITsL4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
What really makes the whole experience strange is that while you try to navigate a course, you can also catch more fish, because you actually have two fishing rods. This then presents a single analogue stick version of the same minigame, though this one requires more specific timing as you have to hit R2 at the same time as an arrow that's spinning around in a circle.
</p>
<p>
Now, to be clear: FISH³, in its current state, is jank as hell. I had a go at the demo and it is a sensory overload to start off with. And yet, I'm also incredibly fascinated by it. Like many arcade racers, you have target times and scores to beat, the former potentially hindered by you taking too long to reel in more fish (and other things), the latter bolstered by catching lots of fish (and other things).
</p>
<p>
There is absolutely the foundation of a special, but very odd, arcade game in there, one that I can see the biggest of sickos figuring out strats most of us will only be able to enjoy through clips on TikTok. I'm quite looking forward to seeing how it shapes up, and if you are too, then you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3641250/FISH_FISHTASTIC_FISHING_FISHSCAPES/">here</a>.

                <p>EA has been revealing a ton of detail about the changes and additions it's bringing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and today it revealed its stadium rankings. Taking into account crowds, noise, and "hostile atmosphere," EA has produced a list of the toughest stadiums in college football for visiting teams.</p><p>Part of EA's focus on improving its representation of the traditions, spirit, and overall vibes of particular campuses, this list of tough stadiums is probably not going to be too surprising to most college football fans. LSU's infamously loud and hostile Tiger Stadium, for instance, comes in at the top spot, and most of the rest of the SEC is not too far behind. Aligned with college football stereotypes and memes, you're not going to find any California schools on the list. However, college football fans are nothing if not ferociously loyal, so I'm sure this list will still find a way to spark heated debate. You can see the full list below.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week/">Little Nightmares Showcase</a> today, which the company announced was happening just last week, and it revealed a lot more than what players originally expected.</p>
<p>The expectation was that it would be a showcase focused on Little Nightmares III, with new gameplay and a release date revealed, which did happen. Bandai and Supermassive Games announced that Little Nightmares III will arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on <strong>October 10, 2025.</strong> We also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2baUKpm5k">10-minute look at gameplay</a> from a Carnevale level in the game, and the confirmation that it'll also release on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was the announcement of several new Little Nightmares projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Showcase Event" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oa85Ns7uegc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, a remaster of the original game, Little Nightmares: Enhanced Edition, was announced, though in a bit of an odd way.</p>
<p>The remaster will arrive on all platforms on October 10, same as Little Nightmares III. Players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC will be able to play the game at a 4K resolution at 60 FPS, with improved graphics, ray-traced reflections, faster loading times, revised checkpoints, and new assistance mechanics.</p>
<p>But if you want to experience the original game with all of that right now, you can, by pre-ordering a digital version of Little Nightmares III. To be clear, this enhanced edition remaster <strong>will not be out</strong> for players to buy separately for $39.99 until October. But pre-order LN3, and you'll get access to it "<em>immediately</em>," as part of your pre-order purchase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition - Comparative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6bX6GUEqFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the one hand, it's not a bad deal to get the new version of the original and the next game in the series at no extra cost when you pre-order the third game. The Enhanced Edition of the first game is available for pre-ordering any edition of LN3, from the standard to the premium collectors edition. On the other hand, the enhanced edition Tarsier did for <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-ii-tease-gamescom/">Little Nightmares II</a> was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/little-nightmares-ii-enhanced-edition-out-today-on-ps5/">free</a> for those who already owned the game, which is not the case with the enhanced edition of the first Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been mixed online, though it'll be interesting to see if fans attempt to push Bandai Namco to make this new enhanced edition available now for players who want to get it without pre-ordering the third game.</p>
<p>The next major news of the showcase was a Little Nightmares VR game called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes. Very little about this game was revealed, with Bandai only showing a short teaser trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes – Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CvZB0nFaoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The other new projects revealed were a new audio podcast, called The Sounds of Little Nightmares. A comic series, called Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere, and a novel, called Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Little Nightmares Descent to Nowhere - Comic Book Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FK30jqgA_oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All together, five Little Nightmares projects were revealed, on top of the news we already expected with the release date for Little Nightmares III. There was even a small teaser for a sixth project for the series that looked like it could potentially be a stop-motion film or TV adaptation. We can't say for sure, because the teaser was inserted partway through the showcase, and not discussed again. Hopefully, we'll hear more about it soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Magic: The Gathering Movie Screenwriters Have Been Summoned]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned.1227501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The live-action <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> movie officially has screenwriters. Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in February</a> that they would be partnering to turn the popular card game franchise into a film and TV series. They have now taken a vital step forward.</p>



<p>In an official report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/magic-the-gathering-movie-noah-gardner-aidan-fitzgerald-writers-1236441529/" rel="nofollow">Deadline</a>, two screenwriters have closed a deal to write the live-action Magic: The Gathering movie. Those screenwriters are Noah Gardner, whose work includes the blockbuster <em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</em>, and Aidan Fitzgerald, who has written several episodes of the Apple TV sci-fi drama, <em>Calls</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-bloomburrow-artwork.jpg?itok=cEMT5dzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-bloomburrow-artwork.jpg?itok=WCekML4R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both Gardner and Fitzgerald also have some experience working within established franchises. The report credits both writers on a stalled <em>Power Rangers</em> movie for Hasbro, <em>The Trench</em>, a (cancelled) <em>Aquaman</em> spin-off show for DC Entertainment, and a TV adaptation of the cult sci-fi film, <em>Trancers</em>, for Amazon.</p>

<p>Regardless of experience, Gardner and Fitzgerald have a tall order with a <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> movie. Much like another Hasbro property, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, <em>Magic</em> is a complex, sprawling setting. It comprises the main card game, comics, and several tie-in novels. All telling stories of Planeswalkers, immensely powerful interdimensional wizards facing larger than life threats across a sprawling multiverse.</p>

<p>Part of this abundance is due to the card game's popularity since its debut in 1993. Its gameplay manages to be both accessible to general audiences and infectiously exciting at a competitive level. It's game design is so malleable that crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> can happen without anything feeling out of place.</p>

<p>It is such a franchise ripe for storytelling that at one point, Netflix tried producing an animated series. It was announced in 2019 and included an eclectic cast of actors and at one point had the Russo Brothers (<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>) attached to the project. But, for one reason or another, the series was unceremoniously cancelled in 2022, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed by actor</a> Brandon Routh at a film festival.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The twelfth and final episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> <em>GQuuuuuuX</em></a> has finally landed on Prime Video, bringing the curtain down on the newest installment of a mecha franchise that’s defined anime history for nearly 50 years. When I first covered its<a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> theatrical debut</a>, my knowledge of the original series came secondhand via fandom chatter. But after completing the sidequests of watching the 1979 classic and sampling its sequel, I can say with confidence: <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s finale delivers a powerpayoff, but only if you’ve done the homework of watching the OG show that set it all in motion.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>, a joint venture between studio Sunrise and Khara, boasts writing from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno and <em>FLCL</em>’s Yoji Enokido, mech designs from Ikuto Yamashita (of Eva fame), character art from <em>Pokémon</em> designer Take, and is directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki, the visionary behind <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>, <em>FLCL</em>, and <em>Diebuster </em>fame. The premise rewrites history with a twist, where the original antagonist, Char Aznable, successfully steals protagonist Amuro Ray’s titular mech, reverse engineers its specs, and alters the course of events of the original anime’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-one-year-war-explained-gquuuuuux-2000573253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“One Year War”</a> in favor of his nation, Zeon. The moment Char is about to cinch success, he’s cast into a cosmic timeout, setting off the show’s actual plot. Enter Machu, Nyaan, and Shuji, three misfits who stumble into piloting Char’s rebanded Gundam and a mysterious prototype called the GQuuuuuuX years after his disappearance, sparking a new kind of battle where timelines bend and legacies collide.&nbsp;</p><p><em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is littered with deep-cut Easter eggs and mechanical resurrections, chief among them being the return of the <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psycho Gundam</a>, a mech I pogged out for hard as a newfound <em>Gundam </em>fan, and I can only imagine tenured fans losing their minds. There’s even a subtle but potent tip of its hat at <em>Zeta Gundam</em>, its sequel series. These inclusions never feel intrusive. Instead, they’re the kind of thoughtful fanservice that rewards attention to viewers who “know ball” and feels earned in its execution. All of it is rendered with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-06-20/cgi-veteran-hiroyasu-kobayashi-breaks-down-how-he-mech-ed-the-magic-happen-in-mobile-suit-gundam-/.224743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibrant CG and 2D animation</a> that somehow walks the line between spectacle and reverence.&nbsp;</p><p>OG players like <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Kycilia_Zabi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Kycilia</a> and tragically overlooked <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Newtype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newtypes</a> like <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Challia_Bull" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chalia Bull</a> return with real narrative weight as the surrogate parents, pitting Machu and Nyaan against each other, transforming their throuple with the milquetoast Shuji (until its finale, to my surprise) into a gripping space Shakespearean tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is a story about a multiverse collapsing in on itself. But, even more so, it’s metatextually about the generational pressure that every new Gundam series carries: measuring up to the seismic impact of the 1979 series. <em>Zeta </em>came the closest, at least in my tentative steps through the Universe Century catalog. Other shows, for all their innovations, can’t escape the long shadow cast by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundams-char-aznable-is-still-the-most-magnificent-bast-1824117617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Char Aznable</a>.</p><p>What <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> gets right, and audaciously so, is that it doesn’t step at the plate and gesture at Char’s legacy. Rather than fracturing timelines for the sake of novelty, the show remixes continuity with purpose, becoming a multiverse sequel that interrogates the past. At the center of that inquiry is the relationship that gave the original series its pulse: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-episode-11-char-amuro-2000617187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Char and Lalah Sune</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>In the original <em>Gundam</em>, Char, Lalah, and Amuro fall into a dynamic not unlike Zendaya and those two white bois in <a href="https://aftermath.site/challengers-soundtrack-reznor-ross-playstation-wipeout-2097-ape-escape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Challengers</em></a>—only with psychic powers and giant robots. Char and Amuro may be bitter rivals on the battlefield, but their connection to Lalah—and the complicated, half-spoken romantic web that ties the three together—is the emotional core that gives the series its gravity.</p><p>That’s why one of the OG show’s most gutting moments was Lalah sacrificing herself in the heat of battle by intercepting Amuro’s attack meant to kill Char. Her death, delivered by the very hands of someone who loves her, sends shockwaves through both men, triggering a guilt that echoes across the rest of the original series and well into its sequel. It’s that tragic triangle, equal parts war and destiny, and doomed by the narrative that makes the original <em>Gundam </em>sing.</p><p>In many ways, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is once again The Char Aznable Show—a distinction that, frankly, I’d happily vote for any day of the week. The series transcends basic fanservice by steering its narrative away from the man himself and toward his ever-fraught bond with Lalah Sune, reframing her not just as a symbolic Newtype linchpin, but as the emotional culmination of the story itself. Instead of keeping her in the background as a spectral presence, the finale repositions their relationship as its final, devastating denouement.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lalahs death" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ht1iZieFjf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before an alternate-timeline <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-episode-9-explained-lalah-rose-of-sharon-2000610640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lalah even appears in episode nine</a>, pilots Nyaan and Machu are drawn to a mysterious melody—the so-called “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-la-la-sound-explained-lalah-sune-char-2000596117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lalah Song</a>”— a glittering, otherworldly beacon that ignites a sparkling light show only they can see. Dubbed the “kira kira,” it becomes a psychic siren call and their shared obsession. Think of it as <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s version of <em>FLCL</em>’s “fooly cooly”—a provocative phrase folks don’t entirely know the meaning of, but get its meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s here that the series shifts gears from a playful alternative history remix into a genuine sequel that dares to ask a question that’s been circling the fandom for decades: What if Lalah didn’t die? Instead of delivering easy fanservice or nostalgic bait, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> offers a rich, surprising answer that reshapes our understanding of Char, Newtypes, and the legacy of <em>Gundam </em>itself.&nbsp;</p><p>In its final act, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> lays all its cards on the table and flips its foundation entirely. Through Machu, we meet Alt-Universe Lalah, one who has already glimpsed her tragic fate from the original timeline and comes to terms with dying to save the man she loves. However, in a twist that reconfigures the show’s stakes, we learn that the original Lalah was spirited away into Machu’s timeline, trapped in the ocean inside the ship where she died, reimagined as a living MacGuffin, “Rose of Sharon.” In the show, Lalah is once again portrayed as an object of power that the villains intend to utilize in a genocidal plan to wipe out humanity and crown Newtypes as the sole, evolved heirs of the galaxy.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Then there’s Char, who in typical fashion, has been hiding in plain sight, coming out of the shadows in a finale where all of the show’s big players butt heads. But wait, there’s more. The biggest reveal is Shiji, a character who’s essentially just …around, reveals he’s a transplant from the original <em>Gundam </em>timeline who wants to destroy Machu’s universe.&nbsp;</p><p>With each reveal, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> peels the layers back like a mecha nesting doll—but instead of losing the plot, it deepens its emotional core. In my reading of its finale, Shuji graduates from being a minor character to the spiritual echo of Amuro’s RX-78-2, haunted by the guilt of killing Lalah across infinite timelines. His mission isn’t destruction, it’s liberation. He wants to break the cycle, to free Lalah from the narrative that’s kept her locked in tragedy for half a century.&nbsp;</p><p>And somehow, the show—crafted by true mecha freaks who spent much of production arguing over which mobile suits could win in a fight—pulls off the most emotionally resonant <em>Gundam </em>anime in years. It goes full <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>, not just remixing canon but offering a sequel that dares to imagine healing where OG legends and fresh-faced pilots collide in a final battle that’s both about firepower and rewriting fate.</p><p>In the chaos, I got everything I could’ve hoped for as a born-again <em>Gundam </em>fan: Lalah gifting Char a full-blown <a href="https://gizmodo.com/revolutionary-girl-utena-is-as-lynchian-as-shojo-anime-has-ever-been-2000566141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em></a>-style magical girl transformation, a tag-team brawl where <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GFreD</a> (the show’s Eva Unit One send up) and the titular <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GGuuuuuuX</a> take on the original RX-78-2 in a handicap match so hype I found myself rooting for the legacy mech to lose. And then there’s Char getting a tender <em>Code Geass</em>-flavored finale with Lalah and queer, long overdue send off with Chalia Bull.&nbsp;</p><p>Controversially, even Amuro makes a cameo—one that hits hard in universe and feels gross in the way only anime can, by having his original voice actor Toru Furuya reprise his role following last year’s scandal where he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-toru-furuya-resigns-from-one-piece-following-affair-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to having an affair and physically abusing a fan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Distasteful as this element in the finale is, it's hard not to appreciate that <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> not only became required viewing in <em>Gundam </em>canon with gusto but also served as a gateway for newfound fans, giving the show a try and developing an interest in watching the original anime, myself included. When I spoke to director Tsurumaki about what he wanted the show’s impact to be, he said precisely that.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“<em>Gundam</em> is a series that has a long history. I watched it as a child, and it has continued on. It’s been around a long time. However, the generation of fans has really been extended. We now have many young generations who have never even watched the first <em>Gundam</em>. I think the first <em>Gundam </em>is extremely interesting, so I really want the young people to watch it because I know they will find it interesting as well,” <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsurumaki told me</a>. “I hope that the new generation could also watch the old <em>Gundam </em>as well. If that is materialized, I would be really happy.”</p><p>Long story short, it pulls off the impossible, weaving a standalone tale that lightly scaffolds enough context for newcomers while anchoring its emotional payoff in the deep waters of the original <em>Gundam </em>series. By the time its credits roll. <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> doesn’t just earn its place in <em>Gundam</em>’s towering legacy; it canonizes itself, making it required viewing for any fan of the original series and funneling newfound fans to check out the original.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam]]></content:encoded>

The Enhanced Edition has improved graphics and performance, allowing the game to run at 4K/60fps and boasting features like ray-tracing and volumetric lighting.

On PlayStation and Xbox, the standard edition costs $40, while the Deluxe Edition will run you $60 and comes with some additional in-game content (right now, the Steam preorder is $60 for standard and $80 for Deluxe, and it is unclear if this discrepancy is intentional or not). While it'll likely be familiar to fans of the series, Little Nightmares III makes a big change with the addition of co-op--a bold choice, and one that we thought showed promise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-little-nightmares-3-the-addition-of-co-op-might-actually-make-the-game-scarier/1100-6526294/" data-ref-id="1100-6526294">we previewed the game last year</a>.</p>

            <p>
Another month, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update, again one that comes with a list of quality of life changes, but also one that comes with another surprising collaboration. Let's start with that one, which is, weirdly, a new story pack made in collaboration with Critical Role, the wildly popular actual play series. For some context, Critical Role did an official Assassin's Creed themed oneshot a little while back. In said oneshot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>'s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpp3RqWBB/">Robbie Daymond played a character called Rufino</a>, who's being added into the game through this new mission in update 1.0.6.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> explains. "While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners. Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers." Completing this quest nets you Rufino as a new ally, and you'll get the Critical Role logo as a banner.
</p>
<p>
Right, now the regular update stuff. A new nightmare difficult setting is now available with this update, which does a few different things. Defensive options are less effective in this mode, and you need to pull off perfect parries for them to deflect the hit fully. Enemy AI is "smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection." And combat resources are harder to find too.
</p>
<p>
For those of you oddly desperate to wear your headgear during cutscenes, that'll be an option now too, and there's toggles for specific types of VFX that you can turn off and on as well. The regional alert system available in castles has been expanded to the whole province on top of that, meaning that when you repeatedly attack "Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world." There's also three different camera presets when on a horse, for your riding pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for us here in PC land, there's an Ultra Low visual quality level - you can read about the exact specs that's catered to over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/5qj66bYuntViG1YiqYlNJn/ac-shadows-title-update-106-release-notes">post about the update</a>, alongside the list of fixes and tweaks that you mostly don't need to worry about.

                <p>Fan-made video games based on popular franchises always run the risk of having the official rights-holder step in and shut things down, but that's not happening with Spartan Survivors.</p><p>The community-developed game, which has players fighting hordes of Covenant and Flood enemies as Master Chief or the Arbiter, has been given an official blessing from Microsoft.

Microsoft reportedly asked the team to add language to the legal disclaimer in the game's credits and on store pages to make it ultra-clear that the project is not an official Halo game or made in partnership with Halo Studios.</p><p>This language will be added in the next update to Spartan Survivors. "We want to thank Halo Studios and Microsoft for their real sympathy toward us," the studio said.</p><p>You can <a href="https://juanggz.itch.io/spartan-survivors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download Spartan Survivors today on itch.io</a> for free. The game's store page mentions that it's also coming to Xbox and Steam in 2025, but as of yet, it's unclear when that might happen.

                <p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> comes out tomorrow, and it adds free new content alongside numerous tweaks and improvements. Title Update 1.0.6 is headlined by a quest developed in collaboration with Critical Role, as well as a new, more challenging difficulty setting.</p><p>The update's new questline is called A Critical Encounter, and its narrative centers around Rufino, a character first created during Critical Role's one-off Assassin's Creed-themed series. Rufino is voice-acted by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond, and completion of the quest unlocks Rufino as an Ally. In addition to this quest, Ubisoft is also adding a Critical Role-themed weapon pack that can be purchased in the in-game store.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p>The update also adds a new Nightmare difficulty setting, designed to significantly increase the challenge that players face. Nightmare increases enemy skill and decreases the effectiveness of player abilities; enemies are not only stronger, but also faster and smarter, according to the patch notes. Players will also have to be more careful about noise; on this setting, Naoe will make a sound even while crouching.</p><p>Along with these two big content additions, the update adds a bunch of changes and tweaks to improve the game. For instance, players can now opt to remove headgear during cutscenes; Ubisoft has also added a toggle for specific VFX. Title Update 1.0.6 launches tomorrow, June 25, at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 2 PM UTC; You can check out the whole list of changes in the patch notes below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to unlock Critical Role's Rufino as an Ally (image via Ubisoft). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first big collaboration that Ubisoft has done for Shadows. Back in May, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-adds-two-unexpected-crossovers-and-major-parkour-upgrades/1100-6531829/" data-ref-id="1100-6531829">launched collabs with Dead By Daylight and Balatro</a>. The company plans for more content to come in the future: According to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>, future updates will add new game plus, additional story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>Patch sizes</h3><ul><li>PS5: ~6.27 GB</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: ~19 GB</li><li>Mac: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~17 GB</li><li>Steam: ~8.5 GB</li></ul><h3>Patch Highlights</h3><h4>Critical Role</h4><p>For our second special collaboration, we partnered with Critical Role to bring this new content to Assassin's Creed Shadows. This includes a new free quest called "A Critical Encounter," a new Ally to recruit and a new trophy/achievement to add to your collection.</p><h4>New Free Story Pack: "A Critical Encounter"</h4><p>Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy. While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners.</p><p>Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers.</p><p>Unlock conditions: Complete "Way of the Blacksmith" and unlock Yasuke as a playable character. This questline will start in the Hideout.</p><ul><li>Reward: New Ally based on Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows One-Shot campaign character, Rufino, played by Robbie Daymond. You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo.</li><li>New Trophy/Achievement: "A Critical Encounter", received upon completion of the questline.</li></ul><p>With this collaboration, we will also release a Critical Role Weapon Pack inspired by the Critical Role universe, available for purchase in the game store! This pack includes 2 weapons for both characters, a Tanto and Katana for Naoe and a Kanabo and Teppo for Yasuke.</p><h4>New Nightmare Difficulty Setting</h4><p>We are adding a new Difficulty Setting (Nightmare) that will introduce additional challenges to your journey. This mode will impact both combat and stealth, requiring more tactical planning and greater attention to your surroundings. Prepare for tougher enemies and a more intense overall experience.</p><p>Here is a tease of some changes you can expect from this new difficulty:</p><ul><li>Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels.  <ul><li>E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit--imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage.</li></ul></li><li>Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.  <ul><li>E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving!</li><li>E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries--only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state.</li></ul></li><li>Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital.</li></ul><h4>Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes</h4><p>We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature: players can now choose to show headgear, whether it's a hood, helmet, headband, or more during cutscenes. Now your style can shine through dialogue scenes too!</p><p>You will find the option available in the in-game settings.</p><ul><li>Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).</li></ul><h4>VFX Toggles</h4><p>Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience. These include the ability to hide or show the loot on dead bodies, the last known position of the player, the special attacks indicators of the enemies, and more.</p><p>All will be accessible in the Interface option menu.</p><h4>Open World Alarm</h4><p>We have expanded the Regional Alert System available in Castles to the whole Province. Now by repetitively attacking Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world.</p><h4>Horse Camera Presets</h4><p>You can now toggle between 3 different camera presets while riding on your mount (hold the down button on controller/'X' key on keyboard while riding) allowing for a more cinematic experience to take in the full beauty of Japan.</p><h4>Ultra Low Specs for PC</h4><p>We are adding a new visual quality level, the Ultra Low mode. This will allow PC players with a limited GPU configuration to experience the game in better framerate conditions.</p><h3>List of Bug Fixes</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Onryo Mask remained visible despite selecting the option to hide gear.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to earn Mastery Points.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Mastery Points were not returned after resetting the Mastery Tree.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not switch characters anymore even without gameplay context restrictions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where allies could be trained to veteran rank without upgrading the dojo to level 3.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Gennojo did not immediately appear in the hideout after recruitment. <em>He was busy washing his hair!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes a player remains stuck in a Red Zone, without being able to fast travel anywhere, by allowing them to fast travel to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Oni Drawing remains stuck on screen after completing the "Vision of the Realms" quest.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h4>Quests</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "A Chance Encounter" quest when following Fuyu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the quest after defeating all Kabukimono.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Lady Oichi's letter became unavailable after the Fuji-maru cutscene.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to talk to Katsuhime in the crop field when she was sitting on the ground. <em>She just wanted some peace and quiet!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where tracking the "Temple Stories" quest only showed a progress bar with no text.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Genzaburo's Teppo Master was missing from the Kaya Shrine.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yagyu Munetoshi revealed a later plot point too early in the "Nobutsuna's Students" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not assassinate the Godai of Void because the NPC was missing. <em>He took his name too seriously.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest after dodge rolling and dropping Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest when there was no immediate option to carry Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players glitched through an anomaly in the "Heads Will Roll" quest, making Animus activities unavailable.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "Lost Honor" quest because the game failed to switch to Naoe.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress through the Tournament after dying.</li></ul><h4>Visuals &amp; Graphics</h4><ul><li>Fixed some minor visual issues.</li><li>Fixed misplaced visual elements with the Dark Woods Kusarigama.</li><li>Fixed an issue where all NPC horses appeared as identical.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with Naoe's Sekiryu outfit.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the "Bloodshade Katana" being visible out of the sheath when transmogged.</li><li>Fixed a movement physics issue with the Dead by Daylight Oni's armor.</li></ul><h4>Audio</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where footstep audio occasionally ceased when opening the map while moving.</li></ul>

The company says the sum will support its "rapid expansion," including the "scaling of its proprietary AI platform and continued investment in R&amp;D to shape the future of instant character animation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Willem Demmers, CEO of Motorica, claimed that animators spend 70 percent of their time on technical grunt work and only 30 percent on actual creative performance.

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2, with this upgraded version of the original game set to release on October 10th. However, you can play it from today but there is a catch in that you have to pre-order Little Nightmares 3 to get access to it.&nbsp; The game will feature 60fps and 4K resolution. This is not the first we have heard of this release as it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/31/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-has-been-rated-for-ps5-pc-xbox-series-xs/">rated for PS5, PC &amp; Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;</a>in 2023.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition will have 4K visuals, run at 60 fps and have updated visuals. You can see how it compares to the original in the trailer above. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares Review,</a> Tuffcub said, <em>“Little Nightmares is something of a minor classic. Gorgeously gross and surprisingly inventive, it creates a genuine feeling of terror and tension. It’s a bit odd to say a game that involves skipping over corpses is enjoyable, but it is, just don’t blame Tarsier if you have nightmares.”</em></p>
<p>This was not the final announcement from The Little Nightmares Showcase, as it as also been confirmed there is Little Nightmares VR project in development too. It is called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes, though no more information has been announced for it.</p>
