" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Where most games, including <em>Monster Hunter</em>, traditionally give players a flat, 2D map to help with navigating between objectives and identifying out-of-bounds terrain, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> sports a spherical minimap that shows elevations so you can tell when a path is going to take you up a mountain or down into a ravine.

This map adding depth is a fantastic change that reminds me of the maps in the <em>Metroid Prime </em>games. Those maps are the gold standards of navigation in an interconnected 3D environment, so anything even close to them is good in my book!” The only major complaint some have is how much it spins, though past <em>Monster Hunter</em> games have usually had settings to lock the minimap to true North. </p><p>Elsewhere, the new trailers show off some of the ways that monsters <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ekqni5/the_phases_of_wounding_seen_on_doshaguma/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ekqni5/the_phases_of_wounding_seen_on_doshaguma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change their appearance</a></span> as they take more damage through each successive phase of a fight. There’s also a new focus mode that lets you aim attacks like you’re looking down the scope of a gun in a first-person shooter. The camera and your character will stay locked-on and static even as you strafe so you can repeatedly target the same weak points and do more damage. There are even focus attacks that, in addition to being more effective, just look really cool. </p><p>You can watch all three of the trailers in full below:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I loved it so much that I even went as far as to call it the best game the genre has seen in recent memory, a game that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a></span>. Five months later, I stand by everything I said. This is a spectacular accomplishment by developer Vanillaware that more people need to get their hands on. The main selling points are its phenomenal gameplay and beautiful art.</p><p>The quality of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>’s art almost goes without saying, this is a Vanillaware game after all. The same team behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-crown-the-kotaku-review-977366436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-crown-the-kotaku-review-977366436"><em>Dragon’s Crown</em></a></span> and <em>13 Sentinels</em> delivers its signature painterly environment and beautiful character design. And, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> applies that amazing art to a medieval fantasy world, so expect to see lofty castles and plenty of knights in shining armor. The game’s world, which is broken into multiple kingdoms with different terrain, is also a delight to the eyes. Travel from one end of the map to the other and watch it change from deep blues on the coastline to verdant green forests and eventually to blistering white snowfields or burning yellow deserts. Of course there is more to do than just look at pretty art in this world.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-recommend-id="image://0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-recommend-id="image://0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The meat of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> is its seemingly endless number of combat systems that meld together to make a truly thrilling tactical RPG that melds real-time and turn-based action. When large scale battles are triggered you control your units on a real-time map, directing your troops on the field against the enemy. When a unit does clash with the opponent, it turns into an automatic face-off that fans of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a></span> might be familiar with. Based on how you built your unit—with position, troop makeup, and equipment, the battle will automatically be won or lost. It means that while the moment-to-moment of battle is real-time, the bulk of your success is determined before you step onto the battlefield.<br></p><p>Mastering<em> Unicorn Overlor</em>d requires getting deep into the systems that take place before battle. You must understand how each troop’s class gives them different advantages and disadvantages in battle against certain opponent types, and how positioning troops can drastically change the outcome of a battle. And you’ll need to fine-tune how each troop works with a Tactics menu that riffs on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-the-kotaku-review-1796816046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-the-kotaku-review-1796816046"><em>Final Fantasy XII</em></a></span>’s Gambit System. Even when you start to think you are getting the hang of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> it tests you. Battles will continue to add new gimmicks or challenges to test your knowledge of the game’s systems. If you like a tough tactics game, <em>Unicorn Overlord </em>is for you</p><p>I implore any tactical RPG fans to take advantage of the PlayStation sale while you can. Until August 15, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> available for $41.99 instead of $59.99. Trust me, it’s worth it at either of those prices, but why not get it for cheap? </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While Star Wars Outlaws isn't even out yet, the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-launch roadmap</a> for the game, which includes a Season Pass, has already been revealed. For those who will be purchasing the game, the base game isn't the only thing players have to look forward to in the upcoming future.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have revealed in their roadmap the plans for a Season Pass which will include two story packs. This Season Pass doesn't have to be purchased right away with the game, and it can be purchased on its own.</p>
<p>For those who purchase the Season Pass in time for the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> will get the Kessel Runner character pack, which will include outfits for scoundrel Kay Vess and her companion, Nix. By getting the Season Pass, players will also get access to an exclusive mission called "Jabba's Gambit."</p>
<p>Players will meet Jabba the Hutt in the base game regardless, but owners of the Season Pass will gain an exclusive mission where they have to aid the Hutt Cartel.</p>
<p>Past launch day, the first story pack named Star Wars Outlaws :Wild Card will be released in Fall 2024. This comes alongside two cosmetic packs titled Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin.&nbsp; This first story pack will be included for those who have the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card features missions where Kay is hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament which goes well until she is introduced to Lando Calrissian, and things begin to go awry as it's not as clear cut as it seemed.</p>
<p>The Hunter's Legacy Bundle and the Cartel Ronin Bundle contains additional outfits for Kay and Nix, as well as additional cosmetics for Kay's speeder and her ship, The Trailblazer.</p>
<p>The next story pack is going to be released in Spring 2025, and is titled Star Wars Outlaws: A Pirate's Fortune.</p>
<p>In this story, it turns out that The Trailblazer's reputation precedes Kay, as she collides with Hondo Ohnaka, a veteran pirate. They are aiming to settle some scores with a deadly gang of pirates.</p>
<p>So far, this is everything we know about what is coming in the Season Pass for Star Wars Outlaws. Whether there will continue to be more content past Spring 2025 remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch on Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC via Ubisoft Connect and the Epic Games Store come August 30. If you preorder the game now on the Ubisoft Store, you will receive the Kessel Runner Bonus Pack, which includes cosmetics for Kay's speeder and The Trailblazer.</p>

There were some issues with the pacing of this season, though I’d argue that’s largely because of the way the showrunners have chosen to adapt <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, George R. R. Martin’s rather dry novel upon which the series is based—though I won’t spoil anything, the events that take place during this dance of dragons are shocking and depressing, and I imagine the team behind the series wants to drag this out a bit before breaking our hearts.<br></p><p>If you walked away from the <em>House of the Dragon</em> finale a little confused, or uncertain where the next season (which won’t air for a couple of years, it seems) will take us, don’t worry.

Obviously, spoilers abound.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2869ef4fcfebaee435f1be8c37d84772" data-recommend-id="image://2869ef4fcfebaee435f1be8c37d84772" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Daemon speaks to Rhaenyra." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Daemon speaks to Rhaenyra." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2869ef4fcfebaee435f1be8c37d84772" data-recommend-id="image://2869ef4fcfebaee435f1be8c37d84772" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Daemon speaks to Rhaenyra." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The entire season has been baiting us with the notion that Daemon (Matt Smith) will betray his wife (and the woman he groomed). Throughout his time at the haunted Harrenhal, he’s been plagued with twisted visions, including one where he makes love to his own mother and another where a young Rhaenyra (Millie Alcock) chides him for how he treated her. As the season has gone on, it’s been clear that his desire to wear the crown is dwindling, but it isn’t until this last episode that we’re certain where Daemon’s allegiances lie. His final vision is one that sees far into the future, so far that he sees Daenerys, and sees Aegon the Conqueror’s dream with his own eyes, validating Viserys’ decision to name Rhaenyra his heir. That vision convinces him to remain loyal.<br></p><p> In the book, Daemon fights loyally on Rhaenyra’s side in a hugely important battle, and it’s likely that the showrunners wanted to end up there—they just decided to remind us that men aren’t all that fond of women ascending thrones instead of them along the way.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-recommend-id="image://7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aemond speaks to Alicent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aemond speaks to Alicent." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-recommend-id="image://7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aemond speaks to Alicent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Basically because he’s a spiteful little brat with mommy issues. Sharp Point has no real strategic advantage in the war, but it’s very close to Dragonstone, so it’s likely that he just went to the nearest town to destroy it in a massive fiery temper tantrum after seeing how many dragon’s Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) has on her side.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-recommend-id="image://16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aegon and Larys speak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aegon and Larys speak." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-recommend-id="image://16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aegon and Larys speak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is fairly obvious, except for the fact that him leaving King’s Landing could be considered an abdication of the throne. However, since Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) is already the de factor leader of the realm, and his ire is clearly worsening, Larys (Matthew Needham) rightfully suggests that Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) get the hell out of there before his brother comes back and tries to finish the job (read: kill him). Aegon will play a <em>major </em>role in the coming events, trust me.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5e1f398e078257a5e2a9f1cefe529ce" data-recommend-id="image://e5e1f398e078257a5e2a9f1cefe529ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Otto Hightower sits behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Otto Hightower sits behind bars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5e1f398e078257a5e2a9f1cefe529ce" data-recommend-id="image://e5e1f398e078257a5e2a9f1cefe529ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Otto Hightower sits behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a montage at the end of the episode, we see Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) behind bars somewhere. The last we saw of him, he was leaving King’s Landing after being sacked as Hand of the King. The last we heard of him, Aemond told Larys to go fetch him, and Alicent was worried he wasn’t responding to her letters. Welp, that’s because he was captured. By who? It’s unclear, but it’s probably someone from Team Black.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3edc7faa5a16dab152d9b76f1104ebe8" data-recommend-id="image://3edc7faa5a16dab152d9b76f1104ebe8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Criston Cole sits next to a fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Criston Cole sits next to a fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3edc7faa5a16dab152d9b76f1104ebe8" data-recommend-id="image://3edc7faa5a16dab152d9b76f1104ebe8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Criston Cole sits next to a fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No. He is still an asshole.

As many people suspect, it’s likely that Rhaena is replacing Nettles, a character in the book who tames Sheepstealer. So yes, I’d say that Rhaena will be on dragonback in season 3.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-recommend-id="image://c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhaenyra and Alicent talk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rhaenyra and Alicent talk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-recommend-id="image://c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhaenyra and Alicent talk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, this doesn’t happen in the book at all, but is a fantastic example of the showrunner’s weaving a clever story from a novel written like a history book. Of course Alicent (Olivia Cooke), struggling with what horrors she has inadvertently put in place both with her decisions and with the rearing of her children, would appeal to her once-best-friend (and definite love of her life). Rhaenyra and Alicent have a special bond, and they’re also keenly aware of the dangers of out of control men. “You will enter as a conqueror,” Alicent tells Rhaenyra. “Once you take the throne, this senseless war must end.” And if Aegon refuses to bend the knee, Alicent confirms that she will have to be okay with Rhaenyra beheading him over it. Oop.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-recommend-id="image://4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Addam bends the knee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Addam bends the knee." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-recommend-id="image://4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Addam bends the knee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A brief scene in the final montage shows a dragon soaring over troops marching in Oldtown. That’s is Tessarion, the dragon we know from the books belongs to Daeron Targaryen, Alicent’s youngest son. Remember she was asking about him when her brother first came to King’s Landing, and was relieved to learn he is sweet and kind? Yeah, it’s that kid, but the showrunners cleverly keep the camera <em>far</em> away from Tessarion so we can’t see its dragonrider, as they likely haven’t cast Daeron yet.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5d4e17ab2b5d34bfc4b1b9a6e8260e57" data-recommend-id="image://5d4e17ab2b5d34bfc4b1b9a6e8260e57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Corlys looks off camera.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Battle is near, and trust me, it’s going to quickly escalate into the kinds of horrors we’d expect from a <em>Game of Thrones</em> series. Sure, we have to wait until whenever the hell season three debuts, but I imagine that the perceived slowness of this season will be swiftly made up for. Rhaenyra, her new dragon riders, and Daemon are all going towards King’s Landing, meanwhile Aegon is heading away from it. Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) is crossing the narrow sea to fight Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and his fleet, who are blockading Blackwater Bay so King’s Landing will continue to have supply issues, which will further piss off the smallfolk. The Starks have also come down from Winterfell and are marching through The Twins.<br></p><p>War is on the horizon, my friends, and remember what Rhaenys (Eve Best) said: “There is no war so hateful to the gods as a war between kin, and no war so bloody as a war between dragons.”</p><hr><p><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 3 does not yet have a release date.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has just revealed an image showcasing what appears to be the next Tarkov ‘boss character – <strong>Partisan</strong>. In an image posted on social media, players get an exclusive first look at Partisan, an ageing, capable-looking combatant with a solid-looking AK and what appears to be a grenade linked to a tripwire.</p>



<p>This is, of course, the embodiment of months’ worth of rumours suggesting that a ‘PMC-hunting’ boss would be making their way into Escape from Tarkov, boasting the ability to lay traps for unsuspecting players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-is-partisan-in-tarkov">Who is Partisan in Tarkov?</h2>



<p>Not much is known about Partisan aside from what we can glean from his image. He looks to be in his fifties, and his outfit suggests he’s more than comfortable with a combat-focused role. He wields a well-built AK-platform assault rifle complete with a ‘GP-style’ underbarrel grenade launcher.</p>



<p>Per the image, he will most likely have the ability to lay tripwire-based booby traps. In his hand, he’s holding a grenade linked to a length of thin cable, which means two things:</p>



<ol>
<li>Battlestate Games is making true to the promise to introduce traps</li>



<li>Partisan is almost certainly the ‘PMC Hunter’ boss we’ve heard about in recent discussions</li>
</ol>



<p>It was recently suggested that a PMC Karma system will be introduced with the next Tarkov wipe, and this boss will hunt down players with ‘low karma’ that comes about as a result of camping and engaging in nefarious or sly tactics. We don’t yet know how karma will be calculated or what’ll go <strong>into </strong>that calculation, but it’s another arm to the many meta games that players take part in when they boot up Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>What else do we know about Partisan in Tarkov?</p>



<p>Well, he appears to have some control over nature, as a small bird is perched on his hand. Could he be using wildlife to spot PMCs from a distance? In the shot, he’s also standing behind cover in a dense forest that has a signpost behind it highlighting a minefield, which means he’s on a map like Shoreline or Woods. </p>



<p>He also has several dog tags slung around his neck and both USEC and BEAR patches on his backpack, which means he’s not picky about what faction he takes on. </p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when the next Tarkov wipe will hit, but it’s expected to arrive in the next two weeks.</p>

This is ostensibly for some corporation, and while I haven’t finished the game, I get the sense there’s more to this story than just doing a job. To get to these mountain peaks, you climb routes of varying difficulties scattered across the game’s world.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Valley Peaks – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUmd7D2AuMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mountains have different difficulties, portrayed by a star rating. Some of them are straightforward climbs, swinging and jumping between rocks and the occasional wooden pole. Touching these poles in order fills out a stamp card; when you have three stamps, you can trade it in for an upgrade, such as a watch that slows down time or a glider that lets you soar off peaks. Other routes are more complicated. Some have rocks that collapse if you hold them too long, or ones you can only climb on when they’re a certain color. Others have moving train cars that require careful timing to navigate, or spiked plants that push you back. Given that the game is first-person, I sometimes had trouble understanding where my body was in space and struggled with some routes. I also indulged in my fatal <a href="https://kotaku.com/mobile-game-crux-lets-you-rock-climb-without-going-to-t-1845024500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-life climbing flaw</a> of neglecting to read a route before getting on it, and often found myself halfway up a mountain with no idea where to go next. </p><p>The routes have a lot of variety and often require some exciting jumps or risky moves, and summiting the harder ones feels like a real achievement. I tend to want realism in my climbing games (and all my games, and, well, all the media I enjoy), but I appreciate <em>Valley Peaks</em>’ flights of climbing fancy. They make the routes feel challenging and adventurous, and add a certain time pressure to some climbs that feels exciting without being too stressful–if you fall all the way to the ground, you lose the progress toward your stamp, but you’re otherwise fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The mountains you climb jut out of a surprisingly large and populated landscape, full of other climbers who brag about the local vibes and point you in the direction of things to do. You sometimes encounter people where you wouldn't expect it during your climbs, and they tell you interesting lore about the area. On the ground, there are towns where you can do tasks for the locals, like finding their missing items, delivering their mail, or fixing things up. There's also a surprising, and somewhat overwhelming, amount of collectibles to gather–screws, pictures, mushrooms, and more–some of whose purpose I suspect, as an open world game, I missed the explanation for somewhere along the line. This has made my experience of the game feel a little cluttered and busy, but these activities also provide a nice break when I get frustrated failing a climb, and make the world feel like your character has entered into a fully-formed community.</p><p><em>Valley Peaks</em>’ world is a painting-like mix of lines and splashes of color. There are forests and beaches, and from the top of a mountain, the horizon stretches on forever. It’s really beautiful, and I keep finding myself wishing I could live in its mountain town. There’s one character I keep seeing riding a bike along the area’s trail system, and every time I see them I sigh "I wish <em>I </em>were doing that." You might know that I recently moved back to New York City after some time in DC; while I’m glad to be back in a place where I have friends, I’ve found myself really missing DC’s easier access to the outdoors. <em>Valley Peaks</em>’ fantasy town feels like a version of all the things I miss: just leaving my front door and being in the woods, surrounded by other outdoorsy people eager to tell me a story or lend me a hand. I’ve been enjoying just wandering around <em>Valley Peaks</em>, taking in its lovely environment and chatting with its characters, imagining what it would be like to be able to be outside doing a sport I love all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While running away to live permanently on my bike is one of my backup plans if Aftermath doesn’t pan out, I also know that I’m in my 40s now, burdened with a bum knee and student loans; the dirtbag climber life is probably off the table for me, though I’ll never say never. I’m glad <em>Valley Peaks</em> can let me live some of that fantasy in video game form.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are a lot of rules to remember. Those rules can change over time either through a new edition or the upcoming 2024 revision. Not to mention the demand for dramatic encounters and storytelling. Enter <em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes</em>.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes is a deck of game-changing, character-shifting cards designed for any game that uses <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-game-masters-deck-of-boons-and-banes-card-artwork.jpg?itok=7ZnTnVws 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-game-masters-deck-of-boons-and-banes-card-artwork.jpg?itok=njY64GIl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The deck contains 40 illustrated cards. 20 of these cards provide a boon to the player. These include blessings from a higher power, the protection of spirit wolves as they travel, or the ability to grow a pair of dragonfly wings once a day.</p>
<p>The other 20 inflict banes. A curse that strangles a character to death the more they stay active. A blight that covers the character in thick odorous mold. The list goes on.</p>
<p><em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes</em> also includes a companion book. This book contains descriptions of each card's effects as well as how it impacts the character who drew it. Each entry includes suggested side quests related to each cards as well as ways to scale the effects up and down for different tiers of play.</p>

It can be all boons, all banes, or something in between. Can your players resist the temptation of power, or end up drawing from a deck stacked against them? The choice is yours.</p>
<p><em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes</em> was written by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe5KNXqT7970K8vkHb5BQ5Q">Ginny Di</a>. Ginny Di is a cosplayer, professional Game Master, and YouTuber known for releasing helpful advice videos for new TTRPG players and how to cultivate safe, thoughtful spaces for RPG groups. The cards were illustrated by Tim Foley, the same artist behind board games <em>Maximus</em> and <em>Tori</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes </em>will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. It will be available October 1.</p>

As a result, clients using those products and tools are at risk of unintentional copyright infringement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like other AI toolmakers, Nvidia needs training data for its text, video, and audio generators to "learn" how to create assets.

Despite these concerns, NVIDIA told 404 Media its scraping directives are "in full compliance with the letter and spirit of copyright law.

Acquiring said footage for data sets involved collaborating with NVIDIA's GeForceNow cloud service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In one Slack conversation, senior research analyst Jim Fan noted the service's streaming capabilities for capture and storing video. All of those "high-quality gameplay videos," he said, is "very useful" data to pull from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We'll work closely with [GeForceNow] and related engineering teams to set up live game data capture, scale up the pipeline, and process them for training," he explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, employees raising concerns were also allegedly told by project managers that scraping was an "executive decision" to not worry about. The "open legal issue" (such as breaking YouTube's Terms of Service) would apparently be resolved in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 404's story, quotes from internal documents and Slack channels from several AI researchers show NVIDIA'S active effort to avoid bad press. Its research VP Ming-Yu Liu stressed there couldn't be "negative sentiment" if the company didn't publish any research about its download data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we are doing here will lead to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>zero publications</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," wrote Liu.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/guild-esports-takeover-offer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recently, we reported about the issues that Guild Esports is facing, with financial turmoil running rampant through the London-based organisation that’s backed by David Beckham. It was highlighted that with cash reserves dwindling, the organisation had just £25,000 on hand, and the stock value of the company was plummeting.</p>



<p>Now, in a report shared by Reuters, it has been confirmed that Guild Esports is ‘planning to agree’ to a takeover bid from DCB Sports, a Californian investment firm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-stay-afloat">To Stay Afloat</h2>



<p>It was highlighted in the report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/david-beckham-backed-guild-esports-set-takeover-by-us-based-dcb-sports-2024-08-05/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Reuters</a> that Guild Esports’ stock value has crashed by around 99% since the all-time high was reached in 2020. In a recent all-time low, the share price of Guild Esports touched around $0.08. </p>



<p>In a statement, Guild’s representatives said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Should the transaction complete, DCB Sports will assume and run the Guild brand, backstop future working capital requirements for the private business, provide ongoing capital sufficient to allow it to operate on a stable financial platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’ll be a complete buyout, with DCB Sports assuming control of everything – and that means the full suite of successes and failures currently sitting under the Guild banner.</p>



<p>Guild has experimented with several esports games in the past, ranging from top-tier titles like VALORANT and Counter-Strike to more emerging markets like simracing. Currently, the organisation fields teams in the likes of Fortnite, EA Sports FC, Street Fighter, and Apex Legends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mike-ybarra-ceo-role/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In January, Mike Ybarra left his role as President of Blizzard Entertainment after more than two decades at Microsoft. It came around the time that the tech titan made almost 2,000 layoffs, furthering the damage done to the industry in one of the toughest years on record for redundancies and studio closures.</p>



<p>Now, the veteran who worked in and around Microsoft’s gaming branches since 2009 has announced an entirely new role – CEO of PrizePicks, a ‘skill-based fantasy sports operator’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-gaming-in-a-way">Still Gaming, In a Way</h2>



<p>In the words of Matt Booty, Mike Ybarra ‘saw through’ Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard before departing the company. For almost three years, Ybarra sat at the top of the table at Blizzard Entertainment, and before that, he had a hand in managing the strategy driving Xbox Live, Xbox Game Pass, and the failed ‘Mixer’ streaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7226287019151257602/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On LinkedIn</a>, Mike Ybarra posted a comment about his new role at PrizePicks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m impressed with the talent and capability at PrizePicks. I’m very excited to join this amazing team and build on our great products and business together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PrizePicks explained that Ybarra is ‘closely aligned with the PrizePicks culture, bringing an unwavering focus on fan experience and constant innovation.’ He is also joining the firm’s board of directors. </p>



<p>The company, which has a focus on operating a fantasy sports market in North America, is an app-based solution that’s headquartered in Atlanta. It’s a platform that offers users the opportunity to make money with a wide range of fantasy sports leagues, including the NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB. It also offers a relatively unique esports fantasy product centred around CS2, Call of Duty, and VALORANT, among other games, which is a comfortable enough connection for Mike Ybarra.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-has-landed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>HBO’s massive hit, The Last of Us, based on the PlayStation games of the same name is heading towards Season 2 which will launch sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>The new trailer gives us hints of what is to come with some shots mirroring scenes from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">The Last of Us Part 2</a> such as the Barn Dance in Jackson. The voice overs also suggest that some of the plot will of the tv show will also follow Part 2 of the game. However there are also new scenes such as Joel and Ellie in a wrecked train which could suggest not every plot point will be followed – I think you know the one I am talking about. There again the Joel scenes could be flashbacks, who knows.</p>


<p>We do know that Season 2 of the show will not include the full story of Part 2, the plan is for more than two seasons and to break up the story from the video game. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GQ</a>. When asked if <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-sky/">The Last of Us season 2</a> would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>Would that mean a full run of three seasons or even four? Mazin said, “You have noted correctly that we will not say how many. But more than one is factually correct.”</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48WJNnNefvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Kaitlyn Dever will be playing Abby with Pedro Pascal returning as Joel, joined by Bella Ramsey’s Ellie. The cast also includes Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Jeffrey Wright as Isaac, and Ariela Barer as Mel.</p>

<p>Neil Druckmann has confirmed that while&nbsp; The Last of Us 3 may not be in active development, he has a concept for the game that could tie the trilogy together. He admitted that for years he hadn’t been able to find that concept, “but recently that’s changed.”</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t have a story, but I do have that concept. That, to me, is as exciting as one, as exciting as two, is its own thing, yet has this through line for all 3. So it does feel like… there’s probably one more chapter to this story.</p></blockquote>

            <p>
With just a couple of weeks to go until the release of Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed">shared a post-launch content roadmap</a> which, among other things, confirms Lando Calrissian and Hondo Ohnaka will appears as part of the game's paid Season Pass.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws launches on 30th August, and owners of its Season Pass - which comes bundled into the game's £95 Gold Edition and £115 Ultimate Edition - immediately gain access to the Vessel Runner Character Pack (also a pre-order bonus), containing cosmetics for protagonist Kay and companion Nix, plus the exclusive Jabba’s Gambit mission.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft moved to assure players Jabba the Hutt would also make an appear in Outlaws' base game earlier this year, after fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-pricey-extra-jabba-the-hutt-mission-is-optional-and-additional-ubisoft-says">grew concerned</a> one of Star Wars' most iconic villains would be locked behind a paid season pass. Lando Calrissian and Hondo Ohnaka's newly confirmed inclusion in Outlaws' Season Pass may prove similarly controversial, especially as Ubisoft is yet to confirm whether they star in the base game too.

<p>
Lando Calrissian appears in Outlaws' first major bit of DLC - Story Pack 1, AKA Wild Card - which is scheduled to release this autumn. "Kay is hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament," explains Ubisoft, "but as she crosses paths with the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian, she soon learns that another game is being played." Story Pack 1 arrives alongside two additional cosmetics bundles - Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin - which will also be part of the Season Pass.
</p>
<p>
As for Hondo Ohnaka, he appears in a second Story Pack - titled A Pirate's Fortune - in the spring of 2025. "The Trailblazer’s reputation precedes Kay as she runs into veteran pirate Hondo Ohnaka, " goes the official description, "who is looking to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates."

Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-worryingly-dated-hands-on-with-star-wars-outlaws-ubisofts-galactic-open-world-feels-less-exciting-than-expected">wasn't overly impressed</a> with Ubisoft's open-world take on Star Wars when he played Outlaws earlier this year, calling it "worryingly dated". Ian Higton, though, was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-being-a-blatant-mix-of-all-things-ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws-feels-like-a-proper-star-wars-adventure">little more positive</a> after four hours of playtime in July, writing, "If you're after a familiar, inoffensive bit of Star Wars, I don't think this one will miss the mark."
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws will be available for PC (via Epic and the Ubisoft Store), PlayStaion 5, and Xbox Series X/S when it launches on 30th August.

<p>He said it was going to happen, and then it did. Adin Ross has just completed a short live stream with presidential candidate Donald Trump, and during the stream, he exceeded a live viewer count of <strong>half a million </strong>users on Kick. It smashed his previous record which was set during an interview with ‘Kim Jong Un’ that turned out to be with an impersonator – which is why people were sceptical going into this stream.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-man-himself">The Man Himself</h2>



<p>True enough, Adin Ross just spent an hour and a half conversing with Donald Trump. During the stream, the controversial creator gifted the potential president (again) a Tesla Cybertruck wrapped in an image of Trump surviving his assassination attempt set against an American flag, as well as a Rolex.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://kick.com/video/6304d49a-a6ef-47df-a2b3-40fb5d7c5462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the stream unfolded</a>, the duo talked about everything from the war in Ukraine to the political future of the United States, all while a whopping 589,000 concurrent viewers tuned in.</p>



<p>It turned a little bizarre at the end, with xQc showing up wearing a t-shirt of Donald Trump all grilled up, but that’s par for the course from Felix.</p>



<p>Later this year, Donald Trump hopes to find success in his political campaign, securing a second term of presidency in the United States at 78 years of age. His key opponent, Joe Biden, just dropped out, leaving Kamala Harris to run in his stead. </p>

			<p>This coming Thursday, QuakeCon 2024 officially kicks off, returning to the Gaylord Texan Resort and Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas. This event is being kicked off with the BYOC (Bring-Your-Own-Computer) LAN party, as well as plenty of livestreams for fans to get stuck into.</p>
<p>The BYOC event is sold out, so fans won't be able to participate in that event unless they have a ticket. However, livestreams from QuakeCon will kick off on August 8 at 3 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 11 PM BST. The livestreams will kick off with a message from id Software's Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin. This message will give fans a programming schedule so that they know what to expect throughout the livestream. Along with the programming schedule, there will also be a couple of special announcements from id Software.</p>
<p>Fans can expect to see a livestream of The Elder Scrolls Online Trial Run, as well as a Fallout 76 Camp judging stream. Those who are interested to watch the stream can find them on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda's official Twitch channel</a>. All of the livestream schedules are available on the QuakeCon website.</p>
<p><strong>The stream schedule for August 8 is as follows (all times are CT):</strong></p>
<p>3 PM: Welcome to QuakeCon 2024</p>
<p>3:30 PM: Slayers Club live with id Software part one</p>
<p>4:30 PM: Slayers Club live with id Software part two</p>
<p><strong>August 9 schedule is as follows:</strong></p>
<p>3 PM: Slayers Club live with id Software part three</p>
<p>4 PM: ESO x Quakecon 2024 Trial Run High Score Competition</p>
<p>5 PM: Fallout: Inside the Vault live - Milepost Zero</p>
<p><strong>August 10 schedule is as follows:</strong></p>
<p>3 PM: Slayers Club live with id Software part IV</p>
<p>4 PM: Fallout Summer C.A.M.P. contest</p>
<p>5 PM: Quakecon Dirty Keyboard contest - in partnership with Steelseries</p>
<p>QuakeCon will last four days in total, with plenty of on-site activities for fans to participate in. These activities include the BYOC community tournaments, a Tabletop Village and Free2Play Arcades. For those who purchased general admission tickets, you won't be able to participate in the BYOC events, but you will be able to participate in the rest of what QuakeCon has to offer. The general admission tickets grant people access to the Convention Center from 8 AM CT through to 1 AM CT.</p>
<p>Like previous years, Dallas Pets Alive will be returning to QuakeCon, where people can experience the Kitten AFK room and puppy streams. They will also be selling their popular custom t-shirts which can be found online and onsite.</p>
<p>This year, QuakeCon will be supporting multiple charities. This includes InfluentiALS Foundation, 1Up Cancer, Gamers Outreach and an onsite blood drive for the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend QuakeCon in person but still want to reap the benefits of the event, there will be a sale on all platforms for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-files-trademark-for-new-id-tech-powered-ip-motor/">Bethesda</a>'s games, allowing fans to get discounts on some of the games that they may have been eyeing up for a little while.</p>
<p>QuakeCon 2024 is looking to be jam packed this year, with people even getting the opportunity to win some goodies from SteelSeries in the Dirty Keyboard contest.</p>

It can be found as an item in the player’s inventory. <strong>The hammer is capable of holding five total charges, which can be earned back by completing Echoes activities such as Breach Executable and Nessus Battlegrounds</strong>. The hammer can only be used during these missions.</p><h2 id="h4849"><a id=""></a>Where to use the Planetary Piston Hammer</h2><p>Places where you can use the Planetary Piston Hammer are pretty abundant. You’re looking for a white column reminiscent of Vex structures that have been seen throughout the series with a bronze base. As you move through one of the new Battlegrounds or the Breach Executable activity, <strong>these points will be marked as a starred objective</strong> rather than a standard white diamond which typically points you towards a goal. There are at least two columns where you can use the hammer per mission.</p><p>When you approach these columns, you’re going to want to hold the interact button over them and use one of your charges. Your character will slam their hammer into the base of the column, causing an abundance of samples to spawn in your immediate area. Don’t worry about racing other players to grab them, as <strong>everybody in the current activity earns all resources regardless of who does the collecting</strong>. This is a surefire way to burn through most of the objectives in the “Echoes” storyline, “A Rising Chorus,” since you often have to collect enough samples to bring back to Failsafe.</p><p>By regularly using the Planetary Piston Hammer, you’re not only ensuring that you get a ton of samples, but you’re also using a charge that will inevitably be refilled by engaging in an “Echoes” activity. If you don’t use them, you’ll still be able to find samples around the levels, but the rewards are drastically diminished. Moreover, beyond pushing the story along, you can continue to collect radiolite samples and dump them into the radiolite bay in the H.E.L.M. to keep earning “Echoes” loot.</p><p><strong>If you deposit two or three times the required number of samples, you can even earn better gear, including Exotics</strong>. Spamming the Planetary Piston Hammer in “Echoes” activities is arguably one of the faster ways to level up at a quicker pace and take on endgame content. In short, use them! Otherwise, you’re just sitting on a proverbial gold mine when you could be flush with better gear.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ve heard of lots of rumored projects in the past, many of which were eventually scrapped or replaced by other pitches, but the added wrinkle here is that Martin suggested four of these spin-offs are currently planned as animated series. Here’s where things seem to stand based on that:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Aegon the Conqueror (live action)</li><li>Ten Thousand Ships (live action)</li><li>Mystery Live Action 1 <br></li><li>The Golden Empire (animated)</li><li>Sea Snake (animated)</li><li>Mystery Animated 1</li><li>Mystery Animated 2</li></ul><p><em>Ten Thousand Ships</em>, a prequel taking place a millennia before <em>Game of Thrones</em>, was thought to have been shelved, but in June Martin confirmed that it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/george-r-r-martin-game-of-thrones-prequel-series-ten-thousand-ships-alive-again-8662533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/george-r-r-martin-game-of-thrones-prequel-series-ten-thousand-ships-alive-again-8662533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving ahead after all</a></span>. The backstory of Corlys Velaryon, introduced in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, will be explored in the animated series <em>Sea Snake</em>. While that was once considered for a live-action show, Martin later said that budget-wise it made more sense to have the seafaring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/george-rr-martin-announces-three-animated-game-of-thrones-spinoffs-nine-voyages-8421082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/george-rr-martin-announces-three-animated-game-of-thrones-spinoffs-nine-voyages-8421082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">story told through animation</a></span>. </p><p>Other projects like a direct sequel starring Kit Harington returning as Jon Snow were cancelled early on, so who knows what other ideas have circulated into the mix in the meantime? It’s not completely clear what Martin’s level of involvement is in all of these spin-offs, and how much time and energy they do or don’t take away from him actually finishing the original set of books. I’m sure brainstorming all of these other ideas is a lot more fun. </p><p>And with <em>House of the Dragon</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960">finding its footing in season 2</a></span>, it seems likely HBO will be pushing these in-development pitches ahead with more gusto than ever.

            <p>
Monster Hunter Wilds might not be out until next year, but Capcom has just given the hype handle a tiny tweak with the release of three new videos detailing some of the mechanial additions and refinements players can expect when this latest series entry shows up in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Video number one, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc57d8BTSpM">Basic Mechanics Overview</a>, whizzes through some of the most fundamental aspects of Monster Hunter gameplay before introducing Wilds' new bird-like dino-mount, the Seikret. This (alas) replaces Monster Hunter Rise's awesome dog-like Canyne, serving as a new way to speed about the place.
</p>
<p>
The Seikret can automatically guide Hunters directly to their target if desired, and players are free to gather items from the environment, drink potions to recover their health, sharpen their blade, or switch between primary and secondary weapons ready for battle while in the saddle. The returning Slinger has also had a bit of an upgrade in Monster Hunter Wilds; as well as being able to launch different ammo types found around the map, it can gather items from a distance, and yank loose bits of scenery (rock, for instance) onto monsters' heads.
</p>

<p>
As for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2h3Uxj7nNg">Capcom's second video</a>, that focuses on the classic Great Sword - a weighty blade with slower movements that can pack an absolute punch. More notable, though, is its mention of Wilds' new Focus Mode - which gets a larger airing in <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v3lnXyNFhI">video three</a>.
</p>
<p>
Focus Mode enables Hunters to more precisely position their guards and aim their attacks, specifically to target a monster's wounds and weak points - which are now explicitly highlighted with a glowy red effect while Focus Mode is active. Walloping wounds or weak points while in Focus Mode does additional damage, which Capcom is calling Focus Strikes.
</p>

<p>
And that's pretty much everything for now. Hopefully, Capcom will have more to share during this year's Gamescom (it'd be nice to see something other than Monster Hunter Wilds' desert map, for instance), and perhaps it won't be long before we get a more precise indication of when it'll be showing up for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam next year.

		<p>I can't remember having a summer as personally busy as the one I've been experiencing over the past few months. Looking over my calendar, I have not been home for two weekends in a row since late May, and it's a pattern that will be ongoing until early September, when I'll attend PAX on behalf of my parenting and gaming newsletter, <em>Crossplay</em>. At least my family is coming to that one, and this past weekend was a fun one, with one of my longtime best friends having a bachelor party in San Diego. It was two days hanging out on the beach, and after a week that involved some up and down family health stuff that, before you ask, is thankfully looking okay, it was much needed.  </p><p>-pk, who spent two hours boogie boarding on the last day because he knew that when he left the water, he would leave the ocean behind</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Daily Dad Rock was rudely interrupted by a phone call from my children's daycare, informing me my oldest was throwing up at a pool. Thankfully, it looks like they just irresponsibly spun around on some playground equipment and did a number on their stomach. I've been hoping my oldest would be spared my weak stomach, which I inherited from my mom, but it's not looking good so far. I'm gonna try to stream in the afternoon, but worst case, we were at least able to publish a back-and-forth with me and Rob reminding about the old internet.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> Again, more boulder rolling, before we return to our ongoing <em>College Football 25 </em>dynasty adventure. Did things go well for us last time? It depends no whether you believe me abandoning the run, hoping Rob would know how to pass the ball, is things going well or not. But the setup is the same, with Cado handling roster management, Patrick calling plays, and Rob controlling our destiny in the game itself. Godspeed to us all.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>We'll kick things off with Sports! live, reacting to the first episode of Hard Knocks, reminiscing about several former Bears players who entered the Hall of Fame, and probably doing a decent amount of Olympics chat. I'm going to ask for voicemail questions for this one, something we did early in our Sports! run, which is why we're going to give this a go live. A podcast version will be available as well, probably the next day. I'll also get around to pushing a rock in the afternoon.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>Remap Radio recording will happen, and then in the afternoon again, it's boulder time. Can I beat <em>Nine Sols</em> before this recording? Probably not, but I am only a few bosses away from the end. I am worried this will be a <em>Sekiro</em> situation, though, where I get to the final boss and just go "nah." Incredible game, though.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Besides Remap Radio publishing, we'll return to Daddy's Dogma, as we try to finish out <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>. I'm not sure if we can do it in one stream or not, but we're in a world where we could push towards the endgame, and I'm inclined to make it there, as I'm itching to play <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. But before the dragon's and the dogmas, I'll, of course, push a rock.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

But once you get out of the theater you might find yourself in Deadpool withdrawal. That’s where comics come in.<br></p><p>Both of the titular leads of <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> have a long history in the comics, and if you’re craving more of one, the other, or both, then there are plenty of stories to choose from. To make it easier on you, we picked the eight comics you should read first after watching <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.</em></p><hr></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="00b25787e61fa65dc450752795c99217" data-recommend-id="image://00b25787e61fa65dc450752795c99217" data-format="jpg" data-width="1277" data-height="719" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands before the screaming faces of Marvel heroes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands before the screaming faces of Marvel heroes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00b25787e61fa65dc450752795c99217" data-recommend-id="image://00b25787e61fa65dc450752795c99217" data-format="jpg" data-width="1277" data-height="719" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands before the screaming faces of Marvel heroes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Cullen Bunn</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Dalibor Talajic</strong></p><p>So much of <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>’s fun comes in just seeing the irreverent antihero interact with a long list of characters from across the Fox universe of movies, with no holds barred. It’s not like there will be a new Fox Marvel movie anytime soon, so <em>Deadpool</em> is going to go as wild as it wants. If you enjoy that all-encompassing multiversal mayhem, then there really is no better option than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/15487/deadpool_kills_the_marvel_universe_2011_2012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/15487/deadpool_kills_the_marvel_universe_2011_2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe</em></a></span>.</p><p>The name says it all with this iconic limited series. In it, Deadpool just goes out murdering all your favorite superheroes. The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and more all get violently done in. There is a reason for it all: He’s been brainwashed by super-villain to do this, but that doesn’t really matter. The comic gives readers the signature <em>Deadpool</em> humor mixed with a big dose of outrageous action. This arc also gets bonus points for making Taskmaster, one of the coolest villains Marvel has to offer, as a major antagonist.</p><p><em>Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe</em> is a short, four-issue series so you don’t need to commit a lot of time to reading it all. However, if you want more, then good news: this is actually the first of a three-part arc called the Deadpool Killogy. The rest of the trilogy pits Deadpool against famous characters from classical literature, and himself—it’s a wild ride from start to finish.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-recommend-id="image://b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine dresses Deadpool in a Jean Grey costume" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wolverine dresses Deadpool in a Jean Grey costume" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-recommend-id="image://b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine dresses Deadpool in a Jean Grey costume" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Stuart Moore</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Shawn Crystal</strong></p><p>Fresh off the <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>movie, many will want to see more shenanigans from the titular duo, and comics have a lot of stories to satisfy that hunger. If you want a perfect distillation of the partnership between the two, then check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/12690/wolverinedeadpool_the_decoy_2010_2011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/12690/wolverinedeadpool_the_decoy_2010_2011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wolverine/Deadpool: The Decoy</em></a></span>. The elevator pitch goes like this: An evil robot wants to kill Jean Grey, and in order to stop it, Wolverine—against his better judgment—turns to Deadpool for help. Hilarity ensues.</p><p>This is a one-shot that’s a great time. Deadpool delivers his signature jokes while Wolverine plays the comedic straight man, and it works to excellent effect thanks to writer Stuart Moore’s incredible handle on both characters. The story is also a great action showcase, with energetic panels showing off the duo in a high-octane battle against the evil robot.</p><p>Throughout their long history together, Deadpool and Wolverine’s best moments have been in random issues in larger series. The two have often been ships passing in the night. <em>The Decoy</em> embraces that one-off nature to deliver a short but pitch-perfect encapsulation of why everybody loves the oddball team.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-recommend-id="image://cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool wearing a tux gets cut in half by a laser" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool wearing a tux gets cut in half by a laser" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-recommend-id="image://cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool wearing a tux gets cut in half by a laser" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Christopher Hastings</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Salva Espin</strong></p><p>Deadpool is a character who works better when he’s put in the most outlandish scenarios imaginable.

But it continues to one-up itself in every issue, to the point things are so off-the-rails you can barely remember how it got there to begin with. Watching Deadpool throw himself into a story riddled with spy movie cliches is a delight, with fancy cars decked out with gadgets, secret island bases, laser beams, and every other thing you remember from every <em>James Bond</em> movie ever made.</p><p>Sure,<em> Secret Agent Deadpool</em> isn’t the usual superhero fare you get in a <em>Deadpool </em>comic, and surprisingly it has less violence than the character usually engages with, but it works nonetheless. It just goes to show that Deadpool’s humor and cavalier approach to any situation is what makes him such a great character, regardless of what genre he finds himself in.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-recommend-id="image://5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands facing front with Deadpool behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands facing front with Deadpool behind" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-recommend-id="image://5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands facing front with Deadpool behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Daniel Way</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Steve Dillon</strong></p><p>Let’s focus on Wolverine for a second. You may know and love Hugh Jackman’s thoughtful portrayal of the <em>X-Men</em> character, but <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>gives us a slightly different version. He’s a bit more gruff and depressed than in the past (though I suppose not as gruff and depressed as in <em>Logan</em>), and really doesn’t want to deal with Deadpool’s crap. If watching <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> reminded you how much you love the clawed hero, then pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/2375/wolverine_origins_(2006_-_2010)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/2375/wolverine_origins_(2006_-_2010)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wolverine: Origins</em></a></span>.</p><p>Not to be confused with <em>Wolverine: Origin</em>, <em>Origins </em>is a sprawling historical epic about Logan’s long life. It deals with his time in World War II and the Weapon X program, up to his time as a member of the X-Men. The story is tied together by Logan’s quest for revenge on all those who wronged him throughout his life, which is a long list of names. </p><p><em>Origins</em> nails the brooding persona of Wolverine, while digging into the emotional trauma of his past in fresh ways. It also acts as a great tour of the character’s messy comics history. There are a lot of cameos here too, including a substantial multi-issue showdown with none other than Deadpool.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-recommend-id="image://da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Psylocke, and Wolverine stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Psylocke, and Wolverine stand in a group shot" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-recommend-id="image://da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Psylocke, and Wolverine stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Brian Posehn</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Jerome Opeña</strong></p><p>Not only have Deadpool and Wolverine teamed up in the past as a duo, but they’ve been part of superhero teams together. Most notably the pair were a part of X-Force, the black ops branch of the X-Men, during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/9976/uncanny_x-force_(2010_-_2012)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/9976/uncanny_x-force_(2010_-_2012)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Uncanny X-Force</em></a></span>. </p><p>This run, by Rick Remender, is probably best known for the Dark Angel Saga, which is incredible. Though what makes that arc, and all of <em>Uncanny X-Force</em>’s arcs work, is the team. Wolverine acts as the leader, with Angel, Psylocke, Fantomex, and Deadpool making up the squad. Elsewhere, Deadpool is often so outrageous as to not be conducive to anything beyond a short team-up with one other character, but here he’s an integral piece of the puzzle. </p><p>This version of Deadpool is more understated,but he still puts on a facade of humor that covers a deeper emotional vulnerability. Watching the character actually learn to work with others in service of something beyond his own selfish goals is excellent. The book also gives us some incredible action scenes that build on the teamwork aspect, allowing us to watch Deadpool rip through enemies when he has a handful of friends to back him up.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-recommend-id="image://a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America stand in a group shot" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-recommend-id="image://a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Gerry Duggan, Brian Posehn</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Brian Posehn, Declan Shalvey</strong></p><p>Want to see more of Deadpool teaming up?

Like <em>Uncanny X-Force</em>, this book is a more serious take on the character and it digs heavily into what makes Deadpool tick.</p><p>The story revolves around the Weapon-X program, which ties together the three main characters in the book, and how it has affected all three of them in unique ways. Captain America as the original Super Soldier has to deal with how the world turned to gruesome scientific experiments to recreate him, while Wolverine and Deadpool have to sift through the trauma that the program inflicted upon them directly.</p><p><em>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</em> uses each character to hold up a mirror to the others in the cast. What makes this work is how multi-dimensional it allows that introspection to be. There are still quips and fights to enjoy, but this arc packs some surprising emotional punch</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd30c85cb0db96e3b6baeabab55052b5" data-recommend-id="image://fd30c85cb0db96e3b6baeabab55052b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool kicks a bunch of guys" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool kicks a bunch of guys" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd30c85cb0db96e3b6baeabab55052b5" data-recommend-id="image://fd30c85cb0db96e3b6baeabab55052b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool kicks a bunch of guys" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Gail Simone</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Udon</strong></p><p>Gail Simone has always been one of my favorite comic writers, thanks to her incredible talent for getting in the head of a character and turning them into the most compelling version of themselves for readers.

<p dir="ltr">Sowhatsthecatch (who credits members of the Not Finding A Cow Level Discord, Discord users Jimpen, Tweaked, Teire, and Raffi1337, as well as Reddit user nova_sgx for a video breakdown of the secret), further explains how to obtain the ring in their post. A group of five players (each playing a different class) must first each obtain the Lucky Coin item by looting a specific corpse while under the effect of a Greed Shrine. From there, each player tosses their Lucky Coin into the wishing well in Scosglen, after which they are rewarded with the "Well-Wisher" title and the secret Unique item.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the Ring of Misfortune's item description, it appears as "a seemingly ordinary ring" but fills its wearer with dread. It grants users +13 to all main stats, as well as to armor, thorns, maximum life, and life-per-second. It also grants +13% to all elements. Those are some extremely tiny stat boosts, but it's the Lucky Hit effect on the ring that truly gives the Unique its name--"Up to a 100% chance to lose all of your Resource." Each class has a different primary resource it uses to activate more powerful skills, and a ring that has an on-hit chance to completely drain players of it is, unsurprisingly, terrible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4345639-diablo4ringofmisfortune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345639" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4345639-diablo4ringofmisfortune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345639"></a><figcaption>The elusive Ring of Misfortune via Reddit user Sowhatsthecatch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4345639-diablo4ringofmisfortune.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even if nobody in their right mind would ever use this ring, it's still a fun little secret that has finally been blown wide open thanks to the efforts of the Diablo 4 community. Some in the community are hoping the Ring of Misfortune has some kind of connection to the game's still-undiscovered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-secret-cow-level-mystery-just-had-a-major-breakthrough/1100-6518576/" data-ref-id="1100-6518576">Secret Cow Level</a>, but Sowhatsthecatch states on Reddit that "there's currently no indication that it is tied to anything further."</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt Blizzard will add more secrets to the world of Sanctuary when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, arrives on October 8</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Actors have once again <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209881/mics-down-picket-signs-up">picked up their picket signs</a>. But this time, members of the Screen Actors Guild are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">striking against the video game industry</a> after negotiations for a new contract governing interactive media and video games fell through. The guild began striking on Friday, July 26th, preventing over 160,000 SAG-AFTRA members from taking new video game projects and impeding games already in development from the biggest publishers to the smallest indie studios.</p><p>Negotiations broke down due to disagreements over worker protections around AI. The actors union, SAG-AFTRA, negotiates the terms of the interactive media agreement, or IMA, with a bargaining committee of video game publishers, including Activision, Take-Two, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and others that represent a total of 30 signatory companies. Though SAG-AFTRA and the video game bargaining group were able to agree on a number of proposals, AI remained the final stumbling block resulting in the strike.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA’s provisions on AI govern both voice and movement performers with respect to digital replicas — or using an existing performance as the foundation to create new ones without the original performer — and the use of generative AI to create performances without any initial input. However, according to SAG-AFTRA, the bargaining companies disagreed about which type of performer should be eligible for AI protections.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez said that the bargaining companies initially wanted to offer protections to voice, not motion performers. “So anybody doing a stunt or creature performance, all those folks would have been left unprotected under the employers’ offer,” Rodriguez said <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6">in an interview with <em>Aftermath</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rodriguez said that the companies later extended protections to motion performers, but only if “the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica.”</p><p>SAG-AFTRA rejected this proposal as it would potentially exclude a majority of movement performances. “Their proposal would carve out anything that doesn’t look and sound identical to me,” said Andi Norris, a member of SAG-AFTRA’s IMA negotiating committee, during a press conference. “[The proposal] would leave movement specialists, including stunts, entirely out in the cold, to be replaced ... by soulless synthetic performers trained on our actual performances.”</p><p>The bargaining game companies argued that the terms went far enough and would require actors’ approval. “Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry,” wrote Audrey Cooling, a representative working on behalf of the video game companies on the bargaining committee in a statement to <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>SAG-AFTRA’s strike rules include a number of exceptions for struck companies and work, which makes it difficult to know the true scope of the strike, especially the games it affects.</p><p>For example, work done under SAG-AFTRA’s Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement or an Interim Interactive Media Agreement is exempt from the strike. Additionally, a specific clause in the IMA called “side letter six” grants an exemption to games in production before August 2023. This means that though Take-Two is a struck company, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>is not considered struck work. However, members of SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating committee have encouraged others to refrain from working on side letter six games.</p><p>“Side letter six permits but does not require performers to render services during a strike,” said Sarah Elmaleh, a video game performer and chair of SAG-AFTRA’s IMA negotiating committee in a TikTok video. “This language made its way into our contract for one reason only, to undermine our union’s most valuable tool: a strike.”</p><p>The last SAG-AFTRA video game strike was in 2016 and lasted 11 months, earning performers fixed rate increases, improved safety assurances on set, and better oversight to prevent vocal stress in voice performers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
