Activision officially announced the new release — called <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> — which will include remakes of both seminal skateboarding games and is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and the Switch on July 11th. It’ll also be available for subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">the previous remakes</a>, the new collection will include all of the content from the original games, alongside some modern additions, including brand-new parks and a handful of current skaters like Olympic stars Rayssa Leal and Yuto Horigome. They’ll join the original cast, including the likes of Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and, obviously, Tony Hawk.</p><p>The new game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, which worked with Vicarious Visions — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244924/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-remake-studio-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment-merger">now a part of Blizzard</a> — on the previous remake. Here’s a little before-and-after image comparing the original games to the updated version:</p><p>Activision says that the soundtrack — always an important part of a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game — will include classic songs from Motörhead, Gang Starr, KRS-One, and others, “alongside new tracks that capture the spirit of modern skate culture.” The game will also support cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p><p>The original remakes were well-received updates of some true classics, and the new game will be launching at a very interesting time for skateboarding games.

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remaster of the third and fourth games in the franchise, has been officially revealed. The reveal comes after weeks of rumors and teases about the game’s announcement.</p>



<p>Launching on July 11—confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-3-4-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier leak</a>—Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will feature the game’s original parks with a “classic roster of skaters”. There will also be new parks, skaters, and tricks for all players to experience on all platforms.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Skate through a robust Career mode taking on challenges across two tours, chase high scores in Single Sessions and Speedruns, or chill out and dig into the map in Free Skate,” Activision said via release. </p>



<p>The game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, the team that handled the development of the Steam version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Vicarious Visions, which initially developed the first remaster, was merged into Blizzard back in 2021 and rebranded as Blizzard Albany.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game  will have cross-platform multiplayer supporting up to eight players at once. There will also be a New Game+ mode for players that want to play through the career multiple times without losing their stats.</p>



<p>When it launches, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>



<p>Those who pre-order the game will get access to the Foundry Demo in June. Lastly, players who buy the Digital Deluxe edition will get access to Doom Slayer and Revenant skaters along with extra in-game music, skate decks, and create-a-skater gear alongside three days early access on July 8.</p>

<p>It has just been announced that Escape from Tarkov Arena, the session-based multiplayer platform set in the EFT universe, is coming to the Epic Games Store. This marks the first time that an Escape from Tarkov title will be introduced to a digital storefront outside of Battlestate Games’ launcher and store.</p>



<p>It wasn’t given a release date, but users can wishlist Escape from Tarkov Arena on the Epic Games Store <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-surprising-change">Surprising Change</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been the most popular extraction shooter for almost a decade. In December 2023, Battlestate Games released Escape from Tarkov Arena, a traditional multiplayer shooter with smaller maps, faster modes, and classic loadout mechanics. It was well received, but it has admittedly died off quite considerably in the months that have followed.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Wishlist Escape from </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Tarkov</a><span>: Arena now! </span><a href="https://epic.gm/tarkov-arena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic.gm/tarkov-arena</a><span>

Intense, hardcore close-quarters PvP battles with realistic weapon mechanics, and advanced ballistics are coming your way. Are you ready to dominate the Arena?</span></p></article></div>







<p>Earlier today, Epic Games Store revealed that EFT Arena would be debuting on the platform <strong>soon</strong>. This is a landmark move, as Escape from Tarkov, and by extension, Arena, have only been purchasable directly from Battlestate Games since they were respectively released.</p>



<p>The team released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - Epic Games Store trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Wmz3Yh_3xU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This is likely a bid to make Escape from Tarkov more accessible, with the hope that by making Arena more readily available, it’ll entice people to check out the full ‘version’ of Escape from Tarkov. For now, that’s still locked to Battlestate Games’ platforms and isn’t on Steam, Epic Games Store, or any other digital storefront.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov Arena is a great shooter, but it’s quite punishing – just like the full extraction shooter. It boasts a fairly realistic operating model, and it’s easy to come up against overpowered enemies. This also isn’t <strong>really </strong>a shooter for anyone who mains a game like Call of Duty – it’s not an arcade game at all, and it can’t be played with a controller.</p>



<p>Watch this space to learn when Escape from Tarkov Arena <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will be released on Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-review.1125147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After winning the Game of the Year gong for It Takes Two at the The Game Awards 2021 I’m certain that developer Hazelight Studios was positively brimming with ideas of what to do next. I’m certain of this because the team appears to have used every one of those ideas in Split Fiction. An enchanting and confident two-person adventure like no other, Split Fiction is non-stop, co-op satisfaction that had me smiling consistently as we progressed, parkoured, and pulverised our way through to one of the best finales I’ve ever played. Is it a puzzle platformer? Is it a third-person action adventure? Is it an extreme sports game, or a side-scroller, or a twin-stick shooter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is yes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is the story of two young and unsuccessful authors, Zoe and Mio, lured to a mysterious tech company by the prospect of finally being published. What they didn’t count on, however, was having their brains strip mined of every story they’ve ever conceived. When a scuffle involving a suspicious Mio thrusts her into Zoe’s personal instance within the computer system, the two find themselves forced to work together to escape and foil the company’s plot. Zoe and Mio are quickly and effectively established as polar opposites in everything from their attitudes to their accents, but Split Fiction wastes little time tossing them together. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Split Fiction is two proud middle fingers to the conga line of entitled tech bros who’ve decided art is a commodity that can be scraped, stolen, and repackaged by their plagiarism engines.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an easy-to-grasp premise, and it’s almost baffling that it hasn't come along in a dozen games already. That is, the idea of being trapped in an interactive, virtual world is a trope that’s been remixed repeatedly in film for decades. Of course, Split Fiction nonetheless arrives in 2025 as a particularly timely takedown of our grim future of being drenched in AI slop against our will. The fact that, at its heart, Split Fiction is two proud middle fingers to the conga line of entitled tech bros who’ve decided art is a commodity that can be scraped, stolen, and repackaged by their plagiarism engines only adds to its charm.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Non-friction</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with It Takes Two before it, Split Fiction’s platforming is immediately on point. With a jump, double-jump, and air dash at each character’s disposal, Split Fiction boasts the same high degree of aerial maneuverability as its predecessor. Wall runs can be spectacularly chained, grappling hooks are thrilling swings or slingshots, and rails, poles, and tiny landing spots have a soft lock that draws Zoe and Mio onto them – so long as you’ve pointed them largely in the right direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is a movement system that’s extremely approachable and easy to become adept with quite fast, and one that focuses on momentum and timing rather than getting too bogged down punishing tiny mistakes or a lack of expert-level finesse. It’s like having just one bumper up in a bowling alley; it’s happy to give you a slight nudge in the right direction on occasion, but it’s not going to render you immune from making mistakes entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My only real criticism of the platforming is that there are a few occasions where it becomes tricky to catch up after falling behind your partner, as one player hurtles ahead and the other gets stuck in a brief loop of dying and respawning trying to get back on track. It’s also a minor bugbear having both Zoe and Mio simply clipping through each other whenever they occupy the same space, as it results in a surprisingly unfinished look. Make no mistake, having one character become an actual obstacle for the other would totally destroy the snappy pace of Split Fiction, but it would’ve looked so much better (and still made perfect sense) with some kind of digitised effect breaking up Zoe and Mio’s avatars whenever they found themselves perched on the same tiny platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, Split Fiction’s fast-paced platforming is perfect for its exclusively co-op approach, particularly when played by people of differing skill levels, as it’s mostly frictionless. Die outside of a boss battle and you’ll rapidly respawn near your partner automatically. Die <em>within </em>a boss battle and you can re-enter the fray after some brief button mashing. Checkpoints are generously frequent, even during boss fights. Chip their health down to halfway and you won’t need to repeat an encounter entirely, even if both Zoe and Mio are defeated at the same time. This is welcome because, as incredibly imaginative as the many bosses are, it’s not unusual to suffer a couple of cheap deaths during the fights – commonly after getting respawned under a salvo of deadly attacks that wipe you out the instant you blink back into existence. As such they were only ever brief setbacks, and we never had to repeat anything to the degree it felt like a chore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall it’s not a particularly difficult game for, say, two dads with somewhere in the vicinity 80 years of video game literacy between them, but I don’t crave punishing difficulty and never have. For me Split Fiction soars thanks to its satisfying focus on communication, collaboration, and constant variety. It’s figuring out the path and the joy of suggesting the right puzzle solution. It’s laughing at untimely misunderstandings knowing the penalty for failure is never especially severe. It’s deciding whether to go on three, or if it’s one, two, three, <em>GO!</em> Split Fiction is nothing if not a game that makes you know what it would feel like to need your best friend to drag you off your booby-trapped toilet before it explodes. You’ve all seen Lethal Weapon 2, right? I did mention we’re a pair of 40-year-old dads, yeah?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Split Fiction is nothing if not a game that makes you know what it would feel like to need your best friend to drag you off your booby-trapped toilet before it explodes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Watching two of my kids play after I’ve finished it I’ve since seen a couple of possible bottlenecks (related to timing their way past a deadly obstacle) but if less experienced players have no one around to swoop in and save the day, the option to simply skip forward to the next checkpoint is available as a last resort. Split Fiction doesn’t want to stall anyone indefinitely. It wants to be played.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Clever, bending story</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring. If you’ve ever wondered whether it would be possible to squeeze SSX and Shadow of the Colossus into the same story, wonder no more. Split Fiction found a way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe and Mio are fantasy and sci-fi authors respectively, and the action is essentially divided equally between the two genres, but the fantasy and sci-fi branches of Split Fiction are anything but static. That is, the story doesn’t pendulum between a single sci-fi world and a single fantasy world repeatedly for 14-hours – the levels are always different, each with their own special hooks. Mio’s mental archive of sci-fi ideas range from a neon-splashed, futuristic city full of flying traffic – with gravity-defying cyber ninjas that will have you and a partner helping each other down a high-altitude highway while operating on <em>totally different axes</em> – to a space complex next to a dying star releasing pulsing blasts that will disintegrate Zoe and Mio if they’re caught out of cover. That’s just two, and I’m extremely hesitant to drill down on any more. Not knowing how each new level and side story will shake up the backdrop and the gameplay is a huge part of what makes Split Fiction such tremendous fun to scoot through. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe’s fantasy worlds are initially a bit twee by comparison, and generally had me looking forward to the short sci-fi diversions that are scattered throughout, but they do feature the better boss battles (I’m reluctant to spoil the specifics of any of those either but, broadly speaking, the fantasy bosses are more impressive in size and have personalities than make them vastly more memorable). The fantasy portion does peak later in the story as it becomes a little darker and more grand-scale, which is a good springboard for the lengthy and meticulously engineered final level. It’s not just the most impressively executed stretch of Split Fiction overall; it’s one of the most memorable finales I’ve ever played. Split Fiction is a fine-looking game throughout, but the spectacle of the entire ending segment is a real visual victory for Hazelight.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-is-a-gorgeous-roguelite-from-the-makers-of-streets-of-rage-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Streets of Rage 4 developer Guard Crush Games is once again partnering up with publisher Dotemu for a beat-’em-up. This time, though, it’s Dotemu’s first original IP, with gorgeous hand-drawn-styled animation from Supamonks and a soundtrack by decorated video game score composer Gareth Coker. That’s a lot of talent on one unproven project, but if my hourlong hands-on with that project – it’s called Absolum – is any indication, it’s not going to be unproven for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Absolum is a roguelite side-scrolling beat-’em-up action-RPG designed for, in the developers’ words, “deep replayability with branching paths to explore, quests, characters, and challenging bosses.” I can attest to all of those things being true. It’s an absolutely gorgeous fantasy romp with multiple player classes – I got to try out the tank-y dwarf-like Karl and the lank-y ranger-ish sword-wielding Galandra – where you kill evil creatures, smash up the environments (often hoping a carrot or other health-replenishing pickup will reveal itself), duck into the occasional building to pop open treasure chests or get ambushed by goblins, battle bosses with gargantuan health bars, die, and repeat the whole thing over again. Oh, and though I didn’t get to try it, you can also play two-player same-screen co-op. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For me, someone who has fond memories of many a two-player beat-’em-up back in 1980’s and early-’90s arcades as well as games like Golden Axe on the Sega Genesis, Absolum felt nostalgically familiar in a good way – perhaps owing to its Saturday morning cartoon-style art and animation. And you’ve got a relatively shallow but nevertheless slightly layered two-button combat system that allows you to mix up attacks depending on the enemy in front of you. But the roguelite element modernizes it in a way that gives it both an edge and a ton of obvious built-in replayability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you go, you’ll discover both hidden and obvious power-ups – some are equippable active weapons or spells that are activated by pulling one of the triggers and then hitting the corresponding face button, and others are passives that live in your inventory. All will randomize from one run to the next, but not all the items are necessarily desirable. Or at least, there’s a serious risk-reward system that might change your approach in that run. For instance, in one early run, I picked up not one but TWO orbs that gave me a 20% boost to damage, but at the expense of 20% of my health. So with both of them I had a frighteningly small health bar, but I could dispatch enemies pretty quickly. Fortunately, you can drop any item from your inventory at any time if you’d rather not deal with the trade-off of a particular power-up.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Absolum - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I did say this is a roguelite, so that means when – not if – you die, the realm you return to has a shop where you can spend in-game currency to buy items or power-ups for the next run. This wasn’t fully working yet in the early build I played, leaving me at the whim of what amounted to a dice roll regarding the quality of items and power-ups on each new run. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Absolum has a ton of potential, and dare I say even a high probability of being good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because I couldn’t spend any of the hard-earned gold in between runs, I had a heck of a time with the first major boss – who I sadly don’t have footage of, but at least I can show you another, later boss that looks far tougher. But mine was a mammoth troll that swung a gigantic mace, and who’d summon smaller goblins, some of whom would leap onto you and start biting away at your face like they were piranhas. I would’ve loved to have gotten a chance to experience two-player co-op, as it would not only split the boss’s attention, but as anyone who shares those fond memories of the beat-’em-ups of yore knows, these kinds of games shine brightest in two-player mode. Always. Every single time. No exceptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, between the art style, animation, old-school side-scrolling beat-’em-up gameplay, and roguelite loop – not to mention the developer’s pedigree in this genre – Absolum has a ton of potential, and dare I say even a high probability of being good. If you’ve been lamenting the loss of couch co-op games over the years, Absolum is almost certainly one that’s going to stem that tide, at least for a little while. I’m very much looking forward to playing a more polished build as development progresses, but for now, I’m incredibly optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

                <p>PlayStation has unveiled a new beta program that will make it easier to access game betas, test out new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a> and PlayStation App features early, and more.</p><p>Aptly called the "Beta Program at PlayStation," this new initiative is similar to the Xbox Insider program Microsoft currently runs for its gaming hardware and apps. Sony Interactive Entertainment's Sid Shuman describes this program as "an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas" in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>.

The PlayStation Blog post specifically calls out beta tests for PS5 and PC games, new PS5 console and PlayStation App features, and new UI capabilities on PlayStation.com. Companies like Sony need to thoroughly test games and software updates before they release them to the masses. This new program gives Sony a way to involve fans in that process.</p><p>While the website is down as of the writing of this article, the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a website of its own </a>where interested PlayStation fans can sign up for free. All you need is to meet the age and region requirements and to have an active PlayStation Network account with no restrictions or violations currently applied to it.</p>

			<p>Firaxis has launched the next update for Civilization VII, which has made some of the changes listed from the content roadmap that they released. Most of the content from the update are updates and suggestions that have been left by the community and the feedback provided. Below are some of the highlights of the update.</p>
<p>First is the new Natural Wonder that all players will be able to discover for free, which is the Bermuda Triangle. Cross-play between PC and consoles will also be re-enabled when this update releases. The update includes UI adjustments and addressing reported issues from the dedicated community.</p>
<p>For those that manage to make it to the Modern Age, there have now been some major changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory, as AI leaders have now been given a better opportunity at completing a Cultural Victory. This means that players can expect to see fewer Explorer Unit stacks scattered across the map.</p>
<p>Those going for a Religious Victory will now be able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. When players create their own Missionary Units, they will automatically follow the player's chosen Religion.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">Dispersing Independent Powers</a> is a large part of Civilization VII, and previously, land units were the only ones able to disperse them. Now, Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers, which can be incredibly helpful if you don't have units in that area.</p>
<p>Along with this update, it's announced that the first in-game event that was planned for Civilization VII will instead be postponed to a later update. This includes future events as well, with them all taking a backseat so that the developers can focus on prioritizing quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide.</p>
<p>After today's update, there will then be another major update taking place this month, with Update 1.1.1 of Civilization VII slated for March 25 (subject to change). This will add in the Quick Move functionality, as well as the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities and a new Natural Wonder, which is available to all players.</p>
<p>Looking even further into the future, the developers are planning on adding new map sizes for all platforms except Nintendo Switch, mod tools and Steam Workshop support, and further customizations that can be made to a player's game.</p>
<p>If you want the nitty-gritty of each change made in today's update to Civilization VII, or any future updates, you can find the information on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Civilization VII website</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Sony has announced the new PlayStation Beta program. You may remember participating in previous limited-time beta programs for various system updates for PlayStation consoles, but this will be a unified Beta program going forward. Sony says it will be an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up for future beta testing across a wide range of PlayStation experiences.</p>
<p>With a single sign-up to the Beta Program at PlayStation, users may register their interest in testing access to participating games for the PlayStation 5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on the official PlayStation website. Interested users only need to register to be considered for all these different betas, and if they receive an invitation to a specific beta, it's of course up to them to decide whether to take part.</p>
<p>Here are the requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid PlayStation Network account in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where the PlayStation Beta program is available on PlayStation. For example, it is not yet available in Italy, as well as likely in many other countries across the world at this time.</li>
<li>Players must be of legal age in their region.</li>
<li>It's free to join, and registration is open worldwide from today <a href="http://playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this address</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sony also clarifies that sometimes there simply may be more interest than they can accommodate. Joining the PlayStation Beta program will allow you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee that you will be selected for a beta test.</p>

Monolith Productions co-founder Jace Hall has expressed a strong interest in remaking rancid horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> and its sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. It's not entirely clear how he'd do this, given that Monolith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">no longer exists even as a brand name</a>, following cuts at parent company Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, and that Hall himself doesn't seem to be directly involved with game development or publishing these days. That said, he <em>is</em> the sole current owner of the Condemned intellectual property. So if a remake is going to happen, it'll need to happen through him.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes in the form of a single tweet, following a grieving Monolith fan's request to "make the Condemned 1 &amp; 2 Remake &amp; quite f**king around". Hall <a href="https://x.com/JaceHall/status/1896149517063663708">responded</a>: "I will see what may be possible. Absolutely no promises. Please have ZERO expectations. This will take me some time."
</p>
<p>
Hall left Monolith in 2003 - two years before Criminal Origins launched on Xbox 360 - to work in an executive role at Warner. While at Warner, he co-led plans for a Condemned connected universe, spilling into the realm of film, but these ambitions never quite came to fruition. Hall departed Warner in 2008 to work at a string of outfits broadly concerned with game-as-service business models, entertainment production and esports. 
</p>
<p>
Even as he has moved between roles, however, Hall hasn't forgotten about Condemned. Back in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726144727/https://www.facebook.com/JaceHallShow/posts/10152999663109303">wrote on Facebook</a> that "I am consistently asked when a third game might be created" and that he is "contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/condemned-3-would-be-made-without-interference-or-limitations">Ian Games</a> subsequently, Hall reiterated that: "I am going to grant a license to use the Condemned franchise in general, and the chosen developer will be able to pick what kind of game they want to make. They can choose their vision of the content. They can build up momentum. Perhaps a prequel. Perhaps a simple mobile phone app for starters. It's all on the table. I'm open to hearing new ideas."
</p>
<p>
Would you like Condemned to return? I think Criminal Origins is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">a well-crafted horror game</a> with excellently vicious and antsy melee combat, but "well-crafted", here, risks being a justification for the fantasy of playing a cop who beats up homeless people and addicts with a pipe. That the cop's victims have been mutated and driven berserk by a sci-fantasy McGuffin doesn't really counter the argument that the game actively channels hatred towards the less fortunate, though Monolith are hardly the only horror game developers to do this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which game developer I'd trust to bring Condemned back. I guess the quickfix corrective optics would be to turn the tables and have you fight a bunch of deranged and screaming police.

                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>

Luck? A consequence of split tickets derived from first-past-the-post voting systems? Maybe! Or maybe not? At the ceremony, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet told Game Developer there might be something bigger going on behind the wins, a "deeper message" that indicates game developers and players are ready to embrace "more compact" games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Fun doesn't have to come in a large size&quot;">"Fun doesn't have to come in a large size"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we flagged down Doucet, he'd already passed by several times, accepting the studio's awards for technical, animation, and design achievement, as well as 'family game of the year.' He said he wished more of the studio could have been present in Las Vegas for the show, since the wins are a huge collective achievement for Team Asobi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But give Doucet credit—he has frequently devoted time at award shows to praise not only his collaborators, but his peers in game development. At The Game Awards in December 2024, he thanked </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/">a certain developer in Kyoto</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for being such a huge inspiration and for "showing there's innovation and quality consistently" in platformers, acting as a huge inspiration for him and Asobi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've managed not to mention them, have you noticed?" he asked, eyes flickering across the crowd—possibly towards where Sony management was sitting.

"It's important that we made a game that's quite compact, that is not trying to be too big," he said. "I recognize the fact that it means it's a deeper message than we thought we had sent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What message was that?

<p>The upcoming combined remake will feature new skaters (so, professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">let slip he was part of the game ahead of today's announcement</a>), as well as "gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack, and, for the first time in 10 years - brand-new parks". That soundtrack will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motorhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture".</p>
<p>The game will also boast cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p>

<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">Activision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that clearly wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself teased something was in the pipeline. More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to get back on your boards when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 releases this summer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He also has a fully charged Ultimate, letting you use the most powerful ability of any character being played. Double up on defensive ultimates, use a powerful offensive ultimate, then enjoy a few seconds playing as that character before reverting to Loki. Incredibly powerful and flexible, and one reason why Loki players have so much room for self-expression in how they play him.</p><p><strong>Regeneration Domain</strong> (LB) - One of the most powerful abilities in the entire game, Regeneration Domain spawns at your feet and those of each of your Doppelgangers. It reverses damage, converting it to healing, meaning it can completely negate enemy Ultimates and a wide range of attacks. Because of this, you can save an enemy across the map by spawning a Doppelganger next to them and activating the Domain. Incredibly powerful and worth more than its weight in gold. <em>(Can game moves have mass? -Ed)</em></p><p><strong>Doppelganger</strong> (Right Click / RB) - The key to Loki’s movement and enemy confusion. Creates a duplicate of himself which will remain immobile but imitate his actions. Because of this, it’s best to stand still when trying to confuse enemies, since only the <em>real </em>Loki could be strafing and jumping around. Attacks from Doppelgangers still deal damage to enemies and heal allies, so you always want to have two (the maximum) Doppelgangers out.</p><p><strong>Devious Exchange</strong> (B / Circle) - Switches places with whichever Doppelganger you are looking at. A fantastic way to move around the map, avoid enemy attacks, or get closer to the action. Always keep them guessing.</p><p><strong>Backstab</strong> (R3) - Loki has a melee attack, and it (appropriately) does more damage when attacking from behind. Remind them all how much betrayal stings.</p><p><strong>Deception</strong> (LT) - Turn invisible until you turn it off. A glorious way to avoid enemies, and it creates a Doppelganger at the location where you first activated it, making it a way to jump-start your duplicitous ‘shell game.’</p><p><strong>Laufeyson Reborn</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with Hela, Loki can be revived instantly if Hela gets a final blow while you are respawning. If you are still alive, you get Bonus Health instead. Nice bonus to playing with Hela.</p><h2 id="h12597"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Loki?</strong></h2><p>Loki has an incredibly high ceiling, but he is also a competent healer and damager even without optimizing your trickery. For starters, make sure you always have two Doppelgangers out when engaging in battle. The clones will fire at your targets from wherever they are, meaning you can easily triangulate, sniping from upper angles (hitting enemies over walls and other obstructions), and healing allies from great distances.</p><figure id="" data-id="dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-recommend-id="image://dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-recommend-id="image://dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keep Regeneration Domain available, as it is (effectively) an “I Win” ability when used against powerful offensive enemy Ultimates. If enemy Duelists are flanking you, they’ll also be forced to retreat as they realize how futile their attacks are, and how formidable you and your clones are at fighting back while invincible.</p><p>The only exception are enemies like Spider-Man and Winter Soldier, who have abilities that can move you. If they can push or pull you out of your healing circle, it’s game over, so take them out first, or keep a teammate close.</p><p>If you have an Ultimate charged, you can turn the tables by transforming into them and using it, but make sure you have learned their abilities and Ultimates and what they do, or you’ll be making a quick trip to the Respawn Room.</p><p>Experiment with spawning clones on top of buildings, then swapping places with them, to reach truly bizarre locations to snipe and heal from. A skilled Loki can carry their team to victory with a powerful and versatile set of skills that can adapt to nearly any situation. He also rewards creative thinking in a way few other characters can.</p><hr><p>I may be playing the God of Lies, but you can (probably) trust me. Now get there and trick them all, sowing chaos and laughing all the while. They’ll wish they never crossed you.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Springtime Celebration--which is live now on all platforms--allows players to join Kitty White (and her friends) to collect sakura petals, which can be found all over the island.</p><p dir="ltr">But with winter's chill still in the air, the game has also dropped a new content update for Apple Arcade players: Update 2.4: Snow &amp; Sound.

<p>First up, Firaxis says it's made some tweaks to the Geographic Society victory condition, improving "how this victory feels and plays". It should no longer be quite as easy to "breeze through this path when no other players are aiming for this victory".</p>

<p>Changes to this effect include Explorer units costing more, fewer Exploration Age artifacts spawning per continent, and the ability to study Natural Wonders for Artifacts, plus more.</p>

On the PC side, these changes include improvements to the game's AI and various systems, as well as improvements for its UI.</p>

<p>Console changes are also pretty extensive, with many smaller changes to UI, gameplay systems, and more. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1.0 <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not this is enough to placate players who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">still feel angry</a> about&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s launch remains to be seen. Last month, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to address</a> players' common criticisms of the game, so let's hope the UI improvements in this update are a good start, at least.</p>

<p>The first half of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s inaugural paid DLC pack has gone live as part of this update as well, and it includes a new Leader, two new Civilizations, and new Natural Wonders. Again, though, you will have to pay to enjoy that stuff.</p>




<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series of turn-based strategy games. It includes a new Age system to more clearly demarcate time periods, as well as changes to city-building, diplomacy, and more.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 has a new Sid Meier's game update that makes changes to Sid Meier's user interface, leader AI, Age mechanics, Mementos and naval unit handling. Developers Firaxis have also stirred in a free bonus Natural Wonder, Sid Meier's Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the on-going arguments about whether (Sid Meier's - OK, enough of that now) Civilization 7 is an unambiguous low point for the series, or yet another flawed 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim that will find its feet via post-launch updates, I love the idea of a Bermuda Triangle just popping up in my simulation, like a black hole spawning in my fridge. I hope it works as in legends about the real-life Bermuda Triangle (or in the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>), with whole armies and fleets getting swallowed up in transit and/or scattered across the globe at random.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Formally titled Update 1.1.0, the patch is reportedly based on “community suggestions and feedback”. It’s live today and – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/upcoming-civilization-vii-expansion-release-dates-seemingly-leaked-by-nintendo">as rumoured last week</a> - accompanies the first part of the paid Crossroads Of The World DLC Collection, which features a new leader, Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (in the Modern Age) and Carthage (in Antiquity), and a Natural Wonder pack with four more Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.
</p>
<p>
The developers had planned to launch Civilization 7’s first in-game Event, Natural Wonder Battle, alongside the update, but “events are now being postponed to a later update to allow us more time to prioritize quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide”. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s a PR-supplied highlights reel for Update 1.1.0. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players)
</p>
<p>
- Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues
</p>
<p>
- Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!)
</p>
<p>
- Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion
</p>
<p>
- Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers
</p>
<p>
- Balance pass on several Mementos
</p>
<p>
- Refinements to the Army Unpacking action
</p>
<p>
- Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account
</p>
<p>
- For console players: all prior updates from Update 1.0.1 Patches 1, 2, and 3 will be implemented, in addition to the items noted above
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There’s another Civ 7 patcheroo on the way on 25th March, called Update 1.1.1. It introduces Mount Everest as a free Natural Wonder, adds quick move functionality, and tinkers further with the AI, amongst other things. It's timed to accompany the second half of the aforesaid Crossroads Of The World DLC, which adds another new leader, Simón Bolívar, together with Nepal (Modern Age) and Bulgaria (Exploration Age). Here’s a breakdown in advance:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes. Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. 
</p>
<p>
- Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI
</p>
<p>
- Adding Quick Move functionality
</p>
<p>
- Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities
</p>
<p>
- Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games
</p>
<p>
- Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in Civ VI
</p>
<p>
- Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible
</p>
<p>
- New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In our fashionably late <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civilization 7 review</a>, Actual Game Designer Greg Costikyan concluded that “despite its flaws, Civilization 7 sustains that “one more turn!” desire to plow through history and see what happens next.” I am certainly interested to see what happens next with Civ 7. Going by site stats, you are all very intrigued by it, despite some cogent and withering assessments of its failings.
