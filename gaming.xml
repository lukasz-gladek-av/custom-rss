            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft is making another round of sweeping layoffs across its businesses of around 4% of its worldwide employees, with Phil Spencer sending an internal memo which has immediately leaked publicly.</p>
<p>The memo has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">reviewed and published by IGN</a>, who also had a source relay that Candy Crush developer King has been hit particularly hard, and that Bethesda’s London offices and marketing team are also affected.</p>


<p>In total, Microsoft is making layoffs of around 4%, per <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">The Seattle Times</a>, or around 9,000 employees from the worldwide headcount of 228,000 as of June 2024. Individual teams and employees will be given specifics of what is happening over the coming days. This comes shortly after 6,000 employees were let go in May and June.</p>
<p>In Spencer’s memo, he said that “we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management”. He also acknowledges that this is at a time when Microsoft’s gaming business has a wider reach than ever before, he blows smoke up a future roadmap which has “never looked stronger”, but asserts that “The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously,” and that “a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.”</p>
<p>This all sucks, and once again feels more callous than it really needs to be for a company that continues to be obscenely wealthy and profitable. We will have to wait and see the specifics of the job cuts, but our thoughts go to those affected.</p>

<p data-cy="paragraph">The silver lining is that Microsoft should be able to give supportive exit packages, including pay and healthcare coverage, while anyone being let go will have priority review for any open positions within Microsoft that they could apply for.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">The full message from Phil Spencer is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p></blockquote>

<figure><a title="Xbox Game Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afd3dfea7a4b5/xbox-game-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft has begun informing staff of a huge second wave of job cuts this year, and the layoffs are expected to hit over 9,000 employees.</p>
<p>In a report published by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, studios affected include King — the team behind Candy Crush — where around 200 staff (roughly 10%) are being laid off, and ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. Staff have informed Schreier they weren't authorised to speak to the press.</p>
<p>Other US-based studios will be told of the cuts later today, and the cuts go beyond the gaming division. Many who are losing their jobs today only found out about the incoming cuts due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?srnd=undefined">a previous Bloomberg report</a>. These layoffs follow the 2,000 cuts made in January 2024, and the closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May 2024.</p>
<p>It's galling stuff, and it comes despite the fact that, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html">CNBC</a>, " $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter". As a result, it's reportedly one of the most profitable companies in the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKu_ZSYOos0cnYjMoZ4Emgzx0Wk4z-5LcUARMrLW2FCD-ZYxhyklcUDTygMIUSiLefK1-1OeNKSWM_l1u9MD9aYTQ_REJLnvOcWVKyoM2EgLGDenVhZTizdXJcASovGM9lfMplCFYMhblYNKLSoU7URjjmOlT3xcL_i9Ejt4b8TD">S&amp;P 500 index</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN also reports</a> that Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer has been vague on the details, telling staff in a memo that organisational shifts and changes "will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days".</p>
<p>Below is Spencer's note in full, sent to staff and shared by IGN earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p>
<p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p>
<p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p>
<p>—Phil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rare may also be part of the layoffs as the studio's upcoming action game <strong>Everwild</strong> — which was bound for Xbox and PC — has reportedly been cancelled as part of the cuts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN</a> claim that MS have begun informing staff of the cuts today, June 2nd, with workers based in Europe seemingly the first to learn their fates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division">Bloomberg</a> claim that Candy Crush developers King, acquired by Microsoft as part of the Activision Blizzard deal in 2023, are laying off 10% of their staff, which is "about 200 jobs". They also report that the European arm of Zenimax, Bethesda's parent company, are cutting staff, but there aren't any numbers to share as of this writing.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">The Seattle Times</a>, Microsoft have said that as much as 4% of the company’s total employees, roughly 9,100 workers across all of its departments, could be affected by these layoffs.</p>
<p>While Microsoft have yet to comment on all this publicly, IGN have circulated an email from Xbox chief Phil Spencer to all of the staff in Microsoft's gaming division about today's layoffs. You can read it in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started testing headsets on my new Nintendo Switch 2, I dove in from a casual perspective seeking a pleasant experience with pals on GameChat while running some Knockout Tours in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. I’m not an audiophile, after all. I’m just a guy who enjoys an easy-to-use, comfy headset with generally good sound quality and solid battery life. I found a handful of such headsets that I’ve really enjoyed using on my Switch 2, and I’m here to tell you about them. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the Switch 2 doesn’t allow mic input while using Bluetooth, every wireless headset on this list includes a USB dongle that allows for audio output <em>and</em> input. </p><h2 id="h32345"><a id="1"></a>Alienware Pro</h2><p>At $230, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alienware Pro</a></span> is the most expensive headset I tested since the launch of the Switch 2, and I’d argue it’s (mostly) worth the asking price. Its exceptional ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) was miles above other headsets I tried. And it’s easily the most comfortable option in my current collection. Because of this, it’s been one of only two headsets I’ve used consistently since finishing my initial tests.</p><p>I found the Alienware Pro produces a somewhat muffled voice output, which is admittedly disappointing at this price point. But I’ve otherwise loved many of its other offerings, such as its sleek aesthetic, soft and cozy earpads, 70+ hour battery life, and detachable mic. The latter is especially nice, as it allows the Alienware Pro to function as attractive out-and-about headphones, too. </p><h2 id="h32346"><a id="2"></a>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a></span> is a $200 option that should appeal to competitive gamers. This award-winning headset is well-liked in the eSports community due to its excellent spatial audio and killer wideband mic that provides some of the clearest voice delivery I’ve ever heard from a headset. With the touch of a button, you can even select useful EQ presets, including a few created by pro players for specific games.</p><p>One of my favorite things about the BlackShark V2 Pro is its helicopter pilot-esque visual style, which gives it an understated vintage vibe that looks unique in an era of “gamery” devices. The fact that it’s so comfortable that I often forgot I was wearing it is also nice. If it only had noise canceling capabilities so I could drown out the sound of my cat summoning demons in the background while I’m getting my ass kicked in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it’d be basically perfect.</p><h2 id="h32347"><a id="3"></a>Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</a></span> mostly delivers on its $200 price tag thanks to stellar 60mm dual drivers that offer crisp audio, a cool flip-to-mute mic, phenomenal battery life (up to 80 hours), and sturdy build quality. Admittedly, the high clamp force of the headset occasionally caused minor discomfort after extensive use (4+ hours), but it was never so bad that I felt compelled to take it off. You really shouldn’t wear a headset that long without a break anyway.</p><p>But while the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) isn’t necessarily the most <em>comfortable</em> headset I’ve used, one feature has kept me coming back: <strong>This bad boy sports two USB dongles out of the box so that you can swap between consoles (or PC) with the touch of a button.</strong> As someone who frequently jumps between PS5 and Switch 2, this is a godsend that keeps me from having to switch out headsets when doing so. Efficiency is king for lazy asses like me.</p><h2 id="h32348"><a id="4"></a>Razer Barracuda X Chroma</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer Barracuda X Chroma</a></span> sits at a cool $130, which places it in that sweet mid-range spot. And that seems about right for this aesthetically pleasing headset that does pretty much everything well without feeling like it needs to be particularly exceptional at any one thing. It provides great sound and mic quality, an ergonomic fit, and 65-70 hours of battery life that ensures you stay in the game and off the charger. It’s just a good all-arounder for the average user, and that’s a win in my book.</p><p>There’s also a nice selection of RGB customization on the Razer Barracuda X Chroma, though you probably won’t really get to see any of them since the headset is on your head, of course. I appreciate this neat touch for those with a penchant for some fun visual flair, even if it’s not my cup of tea. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to download a companion app to get all of this stuff up and running.</p><h2 id="h32349"><a id="5"></a>OXS Storm G2</h2><p>Landing just above the budget crowd and just below the mid-range selections is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OXS Storm G2</a></span>. And it’s a serviceable $80 headset that I found myself using quite a lot during the first week of owning my Switch 2. This is a good-looking set of cans with a solid sound profile, fairly decent mic quality, and a 40-hour battery life (20ish with RGB lighting turned on). And its lightweight design was so comfortable that I didn’t feel compelled to rip them off after my pals bounced out of GameChat for the night.</p><p>The cheap plastic build quality means you probably shouldn’t be tossing the headset around your game room or letting kids get too happy-go-lucky with it. But seeing as the OXS Storm G2 isn’t trying to fulfill the same promises as premium options, I’d say it’s still a catch at this price point. And I’ve frequently seen it drop down to $60 during sales, making it even more appealing.</p><h2 id="h32350"><a id="6"></a>Turtle Beach Recon 70</h2><p>Coming in at only $40, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Recon 70</a></span> was one of the few wired headsets I tried on my Switch 2, and it was certainly my favorite budget option. I don’t like being tethered to my controller by a wire, so I probably won’t continue using this one, but it’s a satisfyingly low-cost option with sound quality that punches above its weight. Its mic quality is also significantly better than I’d expect from something twice its price.</p><p>Despite being made of plastic, the Turtle Beach Recon 70 is shockingly comfortable and sturdy, too, so I never felt like I had to be too careful with it. And since it plugs into a 3.5mm jack on your controller, there’s very little to fiddle with on the cups themselves. This lack of extra buttons and thingamajigs to keep up with makes this headset exceedingly easy to understand and use for casual players and youngsters alike.</p><p>Though the Switch 2 is still quite young, having only been out for about a month, there are already some great peripherals out there to upgrade your gaming experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-best-headsets-alienware-razer-turtle-beach-1851785500]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Layoffs have started (again) at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC </a>reporting that the company will lay off around 9000 people. Many of those cuts are expected to hit Xbox, as first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported this morning that <em>Candy Crush</em> maker King, based in Barcelona, is losing 10% of its staff, or around 200 people. Bloomberg also reported cuts to other European ZeniMax offices. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> reports that Bethesda, including its London office, will be affected. US cuts are expected; a memo to gaming staff from Phil Spencer published by IGN says that “the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by [Microsoft] team leaders in the coming days.”</p><p>Spencer writes in his memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p>Spencer goes on, in classic tone-deaf executive style, to praise Xbox for having “more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger.” He writes</p><blockquote><p>We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You’d be forgiven for being confused that Microsoft sees the need for <em>more</em> layoffs, given the company’s decision to lay off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 6000 people in May</a>. And you might wonder how the company could see the need for more gaming-specific layoffs, given the multiple rounds of layoffs Xbox has seen over the last few years. In <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2024</a>, Xbox cut around 2000 people primarily at <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Blizzard</a>, following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a>. In <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May</a> of that year, Microsoft closed four Bethesda studios in Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games. The company laid off an additional 650 people in <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has seen an explosion of unions at the company in the wake of all this. <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA workers at Zenimax reached a contract agreement in May</a> after nearly two years of bargaining. Workers at Bethesda unionized in<a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> July 2024</a>, quickly followed by <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at <em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, and&nbsp; <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenimax Online Studios</a> unionized in December of that year. These unions have been able to form due to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> Microsoft signed with the Communications Workers of America in 2022, though that hasn’t stopped the company from <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dragging its heels</a> at the bargaining table. Still, the unions are one way Microsoft employees are fighting back against the company’s frequent, brutal cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a breaking story and will be updated.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

A cut that big would be 10% of the total employee head count in Microsoft's gaming division, which reportedly has 20,000 employees. </p><p>The cuts to the King studio in Spain were approximately 10% of the studio, so it might be a sweeping 10% cut across the board. </p><p>We'll continue to update this story as more details around the cuts are revealed. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-age-verification-changes-uk-eu-users/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/age-verification-and-more-changes-are-coming-to-nexus-mods-for-uk-and-eu-users-as-new-owners-work-to-keep-%E2%80%9Cillegal-content%E2%80%9D-off-the-site.1233891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<div><p>Nexus Mods has announced that there will be significant changes coming to the website for users in the UK and EU, as its new ownership is working to comply with new EU and UK laws on child safety and the harboring of "<em>illegal content</em>" online.</p><p>Two weeks prior to this writing and the announcement of these changes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/">Nexus Mods changed ownership</a>, with its founder selling the website after 24 years. This is the first major change and action the new owners are taking with the website, though these changes are less about the new owners deciding to shuffle things around, and more about complying with the<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/"> UK's Online Safety Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">EU's Digital Services Act</a>.</p><p>The biggest change for UK and EU users is that Nexus Mods will implement some form of age verification in the near future, to try and prevent children from accessing mature and adult content. Adult content isn't being removed from the website, as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">Nexus Mods says in its blog post announcing the changes</a>, "<em>Adult content is a core part of what makes Nexus Mods what it is; we don't consider removing it a viable option. We are aware that some users may find the changes irritating; however, we are obligated to do this to ensure we can continue to host adult content legally.</em>"</p><p>Some of these changes involve Nexus Mods updating its terms of service to include "<em>more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content under UK law and how we protect children from harm whilst on the site.</em>" Nexus Mods clarifies that the content it is discussing here, including content depicting child sexual abuse was already not allowed on the website. It is just making the language in its terms of service even more clear than it previously was. </p><p>Nexus Mods will also be adding automatic detection for any mods and content that include child sexual abuse. Creators found including that kind of content in their mods will have it removed from the website, be banned from Nexus Mods, and be reported to the UK's National Crime Agency.</p><p>The other major changes include an overhaul of how adult and mature content is categorized, with 10 new content tags being introduced that users in the UK and EU will be allowed to access after they have verified their age. Users will also be able to select which tags they see on the website and which they want to hide. These new tags also do not change users ability to vote on content tags for mods, nor does it change a mod author's ability to tag their own mods. The new tags are: </p></div>



<ul>
<li>Body stigma</li>



<li>Depression</li>



<li>Eating disorders</li>



<li>Extreme violence</li>



<li>Harmful substances</li>



<li>Pornographic</li>



<li>Self-harm</li>



<li>Sexualized</li>



<li>Suicide</li>



<li>Swearing or Profanity</li>

<div><p>The response to these changes has been mixed, to say the least. While no one is arguing that children shouldn't be protected from adult and mature content online or that child sexual abuse material should be hosted on the website, the sticking point around it all is how the age verification will work. All Nexus Mods is saying for now is that "<em>the specifics of this [age verification] are being carefully considered as we want to get this right so that the option to view adult content remains available to adults, whilst fulfilling our legal obligation to ensure children are safe on our website</em>."</p><p>Nexus Mods could add age verification that's no deeper than clicking a box to verify a user is 18 years or older, which anyone who has been on the internet for more than five minutes will tell you that children on the website will just lie through. If the age verification is deeper than that, it could involve users being required to upload a form of ID. How that information will be protected and stored is what has users concerned. Either way, a new form of age verification is coming, one way or another, and its unfortunate for the new owners that this is their first major issue to deal with. </p><p>Founder and former owner of Nexus Mods, Dark0ne, piped into the comment section to make it clear that if he were still running the website, this would be his mess to deal with, and that he would've had to deal with it this year. He said that he's "<em>relieved" </em>it's not him at the helm of this, and adds that he would have made the changes the new owners are making now. </p><p>"<em>You can be worried or angry with the direction the internet is taking and the amount of control governments are enforcing on it around the world</em>," Dark0ne writes,  "<em>but the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</em>"</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new round of layoffs at Microsoft has apparently begun, and employees at studios like&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga&nbsp;</em>developer King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax are losing their jobs, with up to 9,000 company-wide employees reportedly in the firing line.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier, 200 staffers at King will lose their jobs, which represents around 10% of the company's total headcount. We don't yet know the number of layoffs at ZeniMax's European location.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-to-cut-9-000-workers-in-second-wave-of-major-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;these cuts are part of a wider layoff wave at Microsoft, in which "about 9,000 workers" will be caught up. A spokesperson told the publication that the layoffs will represent less than 4% of the company's workforce, but that the cuts are - say it with me - part of "best position[ing] the company...for success in a dynamic marketplace". Yuck.</p>

<p>This is the start of the layoff wave <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">predicted by Bloomberg last week</a>, and it's also not the first time Microsoft has laid off a large number of employees in the last eighteen months or so.</p>

<p>The company's most recent layoff round came in May, when Microsoft reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go of around 3% of its workforce</a>&nbsp;"across all levels, teams, and geographies" (according to news platform CNBC).</p>

<p>Prior to that, another wave of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">took place in January</a>, although a smaller number of employees were apparently affected by those layoffs than in subsequent job shearing efforts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=ag33jupa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=jzBOm8lz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax and King are almost certainly not the only studios affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>I could go on, but the point is that Microsoft has laid off a lot of employees in recent months, and the company is showing no signs of stopping on that front.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these layoffs stopped CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> back in October, and given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-payrise-andrew-wilson" rel="nofollow">recent CEO payrise trends</a>, I'd be extremely surprised if that doesn't happen again this year. Stay tuned for more on this as it develops.</p>

However, it wasn’t really the “indie” project it sometimes appeared, given that by this point the development studio was majority owned by Chinese publisher Perfect World, based on a valuation of around $3.5 million. In 2019, a year after the release of <em>Subnautica</em>, Perfect World sold off most of its shares, and in 2021 the studio was bought outright by Korean developer Krafton (publishers of mega-hits <em>PUGB </em>and <em>InZoi</em>), which at the time said it would allow Unknown Worlds to continue to operate independently. Clearly, that has now changed.<br></p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> put out July 2, Krafton declared that long-time game producer Steve Papoutsis (<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>) has been brought in to be the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, with a goal to “prioritize development momentum and delivering best possible fan experience for [the] long-anticipated <em>Subnautica 2</em> launch.”</p><p>Krafton states that Papoutsis is replacing all three members of the original leadership team, “effective immediately.” The rather combative tone continues:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While KRAFTON sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <em>Subnautica</em> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.</p></blockquote><p>Not so much reading between the lines as just reading the lines themselves, this gives the impression that Krafton had enough of how long the sequel to the 2018 game was taking, and so fired the company’s founders. We’ve reached out to find out if this is the case. The news has clearly come in fast, given at the time of writing, Ted Gill’s X account still states “CEO of @UnknownWorlds.”</p><p>This time pressure is stressed over and over, including in this statement from Krafton’s CEO, CH Kim. “There is nothing more important than the gamer experience,” he begins. “Given the anticipation around <em>Subnautica 2</em>, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.” There’s <em>nothing more important</em>. The statement then goes on to seemingly just outright chastise the previous team, lecturing the reader:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> As part of its oversight, KRAFTON is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios. These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.</p></blockquote><p>It really is quite something. And that’s fewer than half the times the same press release reiterates the importance of timely development. It’s astonishingly passive-aggressive.</p><p>My guess—and I stress I’m guessing—is that Cleveland et al would have been pushing for a delay before the early access release, and Krafton drew a line in the sand. Which, if true, would be all the more interesting given this isn’t a game that’s publicly slipped; it was initially announced as a 2025 release, and no one would have batted an eye if it was made known it was now sliding into 2026. It’d be fascinating to learn the internal situation that’s led to this apparent coup d’état.</p><p><em>Subnautica</em> was a sublime game (albeit with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373">its own controversial firings</a></span>), and will be a hard act to follow. Rumors that the sequel was going to be a multiplayer live-service thing caused a ferocious response, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327">rapidly quashed by Unknown Worlds</a></span>. Hopefully we’ll still get a chance to play a not-quite-finished version of the game via early access some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has begun another round of layoffs at Xbox. At the time of writing, Zenimax and King are reportedly affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">According to a report by Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's Barcelona-based King Division is losing 10 percent of its staff, which comes to roughly 200 people. Staff at Zenimax have also been informed of layoffs across its European offices, though the number of impacted employees is currently unclear. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025">According to a report by Windows Central</a>, Zenimax's London-based marketing team - as well as staff in Rockville, Maryland - are included in these cuts. Meanwhile, a memo <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">seen by IGN</a> has been sent around the Xbox gaming division by Phil Spencer, confirming layoffs within the company. You can read it in full below:
</p>
<p>"Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organisation. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organisational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.
</p>
<p>"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p>
<p>"Prioritising our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental - it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.
</p>
<p>"HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.
</p>
<p>"Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey."
</p>
<p>In a subsequent statement shared with Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson said: "We continue to implement organisational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>These layoffs are part of extensive changes across Microsoft - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html">CNBC</a> has reported around 9,000 employees have been cut from across the business. That amounts to around four percent of its global workforce. CNBC also stated Microsoft reported nearly $2.6bn in net income on $70bn in revenue for its March quarter. As such, Microsoft is still ranked as one of the most profitable companies, according to FactSet data.</p>
<p>Word of today's layoffs first began last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has seen key members of its leadership team - including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> - 'replaced' by owner Krafton, just months before the underwater survival sequel's long-awaited early access release.
</p>
<p>
Krafton, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021</a>, announced the leadership changes in a <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">press release</a>. Cleveland - who founded the studio in 2001 and has variously served as designer, programmer, team lead, chief executive office, and franchise creative director since then - is out, alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill, and special projects director Max McGuire.
</p>
<p>
Krafton did not specify a reason for the departures in its announcement, but claimed it had "sought to keep the Unknown Worlds' co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development". All three have been replaced by Steve Papoutsis, who'll oversee the Subnautica developer while maintaining his current role as CEO at Krafton's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. "The company wishes [Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire] well on their next endeavours," Krafton added.

<p>
There are, however, hints throughout Krafton's statement that it wasn't happy with Unknown Worlds' planned timeline for the development of Subnautica 2. There are references to owing "our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible", as well as talk of "delivering the right game at the right time" using "clearly defined metrics and targets". New Unknown Worlds boss Papoutsis is said to "fully [support] this process". Unknown Worlds had previously announced Subnautica 2 was - much like its highly acclaimed proginator - anticipated to remain in early access for two to three years.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone Subnautica expansion Below Zero), was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">confirmed to be in the works back in 2022</a>. A first cinematic trailer finally arrived last October, tipping a nod to the sequel's new co-op mode, and additional details have slowly emerged since then in the run-up to Subnautica 2's planned early access release later this year.
</p>
<p>
So far, Unknown Worlds has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">aired small snippets of gameplay</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-talks-silent-protagonist-a-big-ol-ocean-map-and-more-in-latest-qa">some of the things players can expect to see in Subnautica 2</a>. The sequel will, for instance, ditch Below Zero's controversially chatty lead and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game. That's alongside the introduction of a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", customisable characters, new vehicles, and more.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 doesn't have an early access release date yet, but when we last heard from Unknown Worlds the aim was still to launch it sometime this year.

<p>Reports began to emerge recently which indicated that Switch 2 consoles in use with the MiG carts could be outright banned by Nintendo, restricting access to all online services. This became even more prevalent when it was discovered that said banned consoles were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-strict-policy-on-mig-carts-is-creating-a-problem-for-secondhand-switch-2-buyers">being sold in the second-hand market</a>.</p>
<p>As such, Brazil's consumer rights watchdog has now argued that this policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for. Procon-SP, Sao Paulo's office of Brazil's public Consumer Protection and Defence Program, now has a <a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/">complaint filed with Nintendo</a> and has requested that this policy be removed entirely.</p>
<p>Consoles affected by the ban would display “Error Code: 2124-4508”. A few folks who have bought the console at a second-hand, discounted rate have stated that the console simply doesn't work and displays the same error message. Thankfully, in one instance, a user was able to return the device after it was bought from Walmart, but when it comes to online marketplaces, purchasing a second-hand Switch 2 might not even seem feasible given the possibility that it might not work at all.</p>
<p>Nintendo has reportedly stated that it will respond to Procon-SP's complaint within 20 days, so we'll be sure to provide an update on the case as soon as we're able.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl says that the updates in question are part of Nexus Mods' "legal obligation to comply" with the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Online Safety Act</a> and the EU's <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>, plus new guidance issued by UK regulator Ofcom.</p>

<p>This legislation means Nexus Mods must, in SlugGirl's words, "ensure [it continues] to remove illegal content and add additional restrictions to children's access to certain adult content".</p>

Nexus Mods says "the specifics of this are being carefully considered", as the site "want[s] to get this right" and ensure that adult content is still available for those of appropriate age. Those outside of these regions won't be subject to age verification.</p>

<p>Other upcoming changes include "a clearer, more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content" in Nexus Mods' terms and conditions, as well as new automated detection for child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>

<p>Adult content guidelines and categorization will also be overhauled, with new revised tags being introduced for mods that feature adult subjects like pornography, extreme violence, or suicide and self-harm.</p>

<p>Nexus Mods' block and mute systems will be rebuilt "to make them clearer and more effective", and the site's automated spam detection tools will be expanded to other site areas, including comments, which will now be "manually reviewed by staff/moderators", according to SlugGirl.</p>

            <p>Look, EA and Maxis, did you really have to do this? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s virtual humans, who've long been able to take solace in the fact that random virtual people in the street couldn't see absolutely everything their despotic overlords force them to do indoors, no longer have that privilege. The game's latest update has made glass walls for houses a thing.</p>
<p>You can also stick plants on roofs, to give your prisoners something nice to stare at through their transparent cells when you inevitably delete all of the doors and watch them die. Yep, I know the myriad crimes that've been perpetrated with pool stairs over the years, and this looks like it'll start a terrifying new chapter for sim cruelty.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-ep19bgu-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=84574&amp;ts=1751455982007">the notes</a> for the update - which lays some groundwork for a paid expansion pack that's set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-enchanted-by-nature-looks-perfect-for-cottagecore-lovers-on-tiktok-circa-2020">make fairy sims a thing</a> on July 10th - EA show these new glass walls being used to build a cosy greehouse. You can find them under the misc heading of the wall patterns section in build mode. How nice.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's only taken a look at Reddit less than 24 hours after the update went live for me to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lpfl1c/took_advantage_of_the_new_update/">a glass prison cell</a> someone's stuck a sim in. It's ok, they were just doing a one-off build inspired by the glass box <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a43215821/you-season-4-joe-goldberg-glass-cage/">from that Netflix serial killer series</a>. I'm sure no sims are about to be trapped in doorless see-through cages en-masse.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sims players have been pulling tricks with windows to create walls that are pretty much transparent for a while now, but you didn't have to cut out the middlemessing, EA. Our species invented opaque walls for a reason. I know, natural light and all that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the update also introduces the ability to stick certain plants on the roofs of houses, because when you pop down the garden centre and buy some hydrangeas, you definitely want to stick them somewhere that means watering'll require some chimney climbing or a big ladder. Other changes it brings include the introduction of a special inventory section where food'll be moved once it goes off, so you can definitely not make a point of feeding your sim it anyway and maniacally cackling at the consequences.</p>
<p>Alongside a wider inventory overhaul are updates to the game's notebook and household collections designed to make those menus easier to navigate, plus a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Now go, and close the glass door to the glass office I definitely don't regret installing in my real life house on the way out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-sims-4-update-adds-glass-walls-and-i-hope-your-virtual-humans-throw-stones-at-you-from-their-see-through-prisons]]></content:encoded>

It will also likely be the cornerstone of a long-threatened push to launch its own app store on smartphones following anti-trust losses by Apple and Google. </p><p>The current wave of mass layoffs hitting Xbox follows multiple other rounds that Microsoft has implemented in the wake of its gaming acquisition spree. Nearly 2,000 staff across the gaming division were cut in January 2024, followed by the closures of critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May. Around 600 more layoffs followed in September, with Microsoft saying at the time that no games were canceled as a result of that round of cuts. </p><p>That’s unlikely to be the case this time around, with the full extent of the culling rumored to potentially include entire studios. Microsoft’s expansive portfolio of game development teams includes ones like Obsidian Entertainment which have prodigiously shipped almost half a dozen games since being bought, as well as others like Undead Labs which have spent years working on sequels that have yet to materialize. Xbox has also been retreating from its console hardware business amidst reported pressure to improve its bottom line, leading to major first-party exclusives like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>going multiplatform on PlayStation 5.</p><p> “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest in June</a></span>, hinting at the current upheaval. “That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because...we are the business that we are.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492]]></content:encoded>
