On May 8th, one day later, Testut got another email <em>from Apple</em> that suggested his app might be at risk because Adobe had reached out to allege Delta was infringing its intellectual property rights. </p><p>“We responded to both Apple and Adobe explaining our icon was a stylized Greek letter delta — not an A — but that we would update the Delta logo anyway to avoid confusion,” Testut tells us. </p><p>The icon you’re seeing on the App Store now is just a temporary one, he says, as the team is still working on a new logo. “Both the App Store and AltStore versions have been updated with this temporary icon, but the plan is to update them to the final updated logo with Delta 1.6 once it’s finished.”</p><p>Adobe does have <em>one</em> logo that’s pretty similar to Delta’s, and all of Adobe’s logos contain stylized triangles with an almost identically shaped gap. They’ve <a href="https://adobe.fandom.com/wiki/Marva_Warnock?file=Adobe_logo_design_by_Marva_Warnock.jpg">had such a gap since 1982</a> when Marva Warnock, the wife of company co-founder John Warnock, first designed the mark.</p><p>But Adobe adopted a negative space version of the logo in 1993 and has used it ever since, one that’s harder to confuse with Delta:</p><p>I certainly didn’t think of Adobe when I first saw Delta’s logo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With two weeks left before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-features-dynamic-handling-the-series-most-comprehensive-physics-update-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a>, the latest installment in the licensed Formula 1 racing game series, we have sent a few questions to Codemasters to discuss some of the new features and improvements that fans will find in the game. The answers were provided by Senior Creative Director Lee Mather and Senior Producer Simon Lumb.</p>
<p>As a reminder, F1 24 debuts on May 31 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X. However, the Champions Edition ($20 more expensive than the Standard Edition) grants three days of early access, allowing owners to start playing on May 28.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BWyNOpuzid8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What was the community's reaction to the announcements? Will you address some of the feedback that has emerged in the launch version and afterward, and if so, which?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> We’ve seen positive feedback to the F1 24 announcement and players have really engaged with the deep dive videos we’ve delivered. Players are really excited about the handling and physics updates alongside the new Driver Career. As always, we’ll be looking to log all player feedback once the game has launched. Players who have been part of our beta program have given feedback on stability, physics, handling, and AI, and we’ve already made adjustments based on this.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of tweaks and changes have been made to the AI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> With the significant changes in the physics and car setup in F1 24, the AI have also undergone a considerable amount of development to allow them to extract the best performance from the new model. This will be evident to the player in how they brake and exit corners and in the level of confidence they have when going wheel to wheel. The added stability of the cars this year impacts the ability of the AI to race cleanly in close proximity to the player.<br>
Another area of major change in F1 24 is in how the AI will manage the updated ERS system. ERS management will have a significant impact on how both the player and the AI attack and defend.</p>
<p><strong>What's your personal favorite new feature of F1 24?</strong></p>
<p>Lee: I can never answer this with just one thing because most of the features in this year’s game are complementary to one another. We have the fantastic new Driver Career, which represents the world of F1, giving players so many ways to fulfill their goal of becoming an F1 World Champion or taking a team to the top of the Constructors Championship. None of this would be possible without an amazing and immersive on-track experience. The core of any racing game is how the cars feel and race and, of course, how great they look. These are both areas of significant advancement in F1 24.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any improvements to the ray tracing features in F1 24?</strong></p>
<p>Simon: Yes, in F1 24, we have extended the Ray Traced Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination solution. DDGI is a technique that better represents the light response in shaded areas. This gives us an extra dose of realism in terms of softer shadows, light response, and light bounce across such dramatic F1 locations as a bright (or rainy!) Monaco, the unmatchable light show of Las Vegas, or the lush forest of Spa Francochamps.</p>
<p><strong>NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ser-improves-ue5-lumens-hardware-rt-performance-says-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shader Execution Reordering</a>, a feature from RTX 40 GPUs that accelerates ray tracing performance, was supported at launch in F1 23 but did not work as intended and was subsequently removed. Will it be available in this new game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Working with our partners at NVIDIA, we aim to give every user the best possible performance in F1 through our technology implementation. SER is a feature on their latest GPUs that helps with some specific ways that game engines work regarding Ray Tracing efficiency. When SER support was introduced in F1 23 at launch, we discovered that the technology did not provide enough benefit on the whole as EGO is already heavily optimized for the Ray Tracing workloads that SER was designed to improve in other engines. As there was no benefit for players, we removed the option from the UI. It remains off for F1 24.</p>
<p>What we have enabled in F1 24, which was not previously available in F1 23, is NVIDIA's Frame Generation performance solution. We hope that players with 40-series enjoy this upgrade for F1 24.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any graphics updates (e.g., higher rendering solution, etc.) for the VR version of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> The VR solution will benefit from all of the new graphical updates added to the engine, with compatible hardware and a sufficiently powerful GPU.</p>
<p><strong>Will F1 24 support NVIDIA and AMD's frame generation techniques at launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> F1 24 will support Frame Generation for NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game support triple screens/surround setups?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> As has been the case in previous games, the game can be stretched across as many monitors as you have VRAM for. It is not currently perspective-correct, so in a 3-monitor setup, the side monitors look more stretched than the middle one. The UI is always rendered in a 16:9 aspect ratio, so in a 3-monitor setup, it will appear on the middle monitor only.</p>
<p>We are continuing to evaluate how we might better support such set ups and appreciate the enthusiasm from our players who want to get as close to the sport as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any joystick support additions compared to last year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> We’ve added support for the Turtle Beach Velocity One. With the changes to the physics this year, players will really feel what the car is doing beneath them on both a force feedback wheel or controller with rumble and haptic feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to ever bring back classic cars/tracks and integrate them in a more meaningful way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> We always have great fun with the classics and I’d never say never to them making a return at some point but there are no immediate plans for this. This year we’ve really focused on delivering an improved, expanded and deeper modern day F1 experience. Of course, the legends are all playable as part of the new Driver Career which is really fun, being able to play with such legends as your teammate opens up a whole new way to play Career.</p>
<p><strong>Will other racing series, such as Formula 3, ever be included in the future? Are there plans to bring back the paddock atmosphere from games like F1 2010, 2016, and 2017?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> There are no immediate plans for this. We are currently hard at work and focusing on F1 24.</p>
<p><strong>You've mentioned that F1 24 is still powered by EGO Engine, which is bespoke and currently best for the game. However, your fellow Codemasters team from EA WRC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-tech-q-no-plans-to-add-lumen-or-nanite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched to Unreal Engine</a>. Do you see yourselves considering the same option for next year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> The EGO engine which F1 is built upon is bespoke to F1. It’s what gives us our ability to move and change effectively, we are continuously adding new physics and rendering tech allowing us to keep the engine up to date and delivering the latest tech. The requirements of F1 and WRC are very different with WRC moving to Unreal to open up the opportunity to deliver a specific feature, that being long stages, which isn’t really a need for a track-based game like F1.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of EGO is its ability to scale and deliver a high quality experience based on the hardware it’s being played on. While people might think it is the same engine, every year we adapt and grow EGO adjusting it to support what we want to achieve in the game that year.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159200/twitch-shaking-butts-twerking-emotes-unbanned<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RO52d7">Finally, all those little dumpy Crewmates from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/among-us/40702"><em>Among Us</em></a> can start shaking their asses on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/twitch">Twitch again</a>. CEO Dan Clancy announced changes to the platform’s Community Guidelines  on Wednesday, allowing cute animated emotes where characters shake their butts and twerk will be allowed on the platform. </p>
<p id="BETmn0">Emotes help cultivate lively and active viewers in Twitch. Oftentimes, spamming emotes and using channel-specific icons in the chat can be just as fun as consuming the content itself. Now, the team is changing the emote content rules so that they’re in line with the general Community Guidelines. This means: time to twerk. </p>
<p id="5l17XY">“So in particular emotes that feature shaking butts — commonly referred to as twerking but we’ll just call them shaking butts — are now permitted under our guidelines,” Clancy said on <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulExpensiveEmuRalpherZ-bGLmmLakcLJN5oER">Patch Notes livestream on Wednesday</a>. </p>
<p id="x7FYvO">The banned emotes were never particularly graphic to begin with and impacted a lot of simple cartoon drawings. Twitch users reported strict moderation in response to the emotes <a href="https://x.com/KaraCorvus/status/1412529590359117825">in the summer on 2021</a>. But now, those restrictions won’t apply. Polygon reached out to Twitch to ask about the change and a representative of the company replied with the following statement: </p>
<blockquote><p id="CNGnrg">We set out to clarify how emotes are evaluated for approval by our teams. Before today, the guidelines we used to evaluate emote requests differed from our Community Guidelines, in some ways. We realize that this may have caused confusion, as it wasn’t always clear how we made approval decisions. Now, we’ve brought our emote guidelines more in line with the rest of our Community Guidelines. We think this step will help to clarify our decision-making process for the community, something that’s important to us.</p></blockquote>
<p id="J58fvN">Twitch users have already embraced the change with open cheeks. Popular memes — like a GIF where a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/21/21449498/among-us-fans-pretty-sus-meme-explained">Crewmate from <em>Among Us</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/among-us-twerk">shakes and bounces its butt</a> — will be able to make a return to Twitch chat. The ass-shaking has long been a popular format for emotes in general so artists have been responding by sharing art of various characters and other cute little drawings of characters shaking their butts. So if you’re a fan of cheeky art like of <a href="https://twitter.com/sweetxsage/status/1790832110334312598/photo/1">this voluptuous Kirby</a>, well ,you’re in luck, because now you might see plenty of it on Twitch. </p>

However, <em>Animal Well </em>also contains some standalone brainteasers that even a full set of tools can’t overcome. Take, for instance, the three-lever wave chart puzzle you’ll encounter in the bottom-right quadrant of the map. You’ll see a line on the wall alongside three dots, and you must use the levers beneath it to manipulate the shape of the line.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As you might have guessed, you’ll solve this puzzle by adjusting the line so it passes through the three dots on the wall. Fortunately, you don’t have to get the line exactly through each dot; as long as you see each dot light up, it counts. <strong>The middle and right levers will manipulate the intensity of the line itself, while the left lever will wholesale move the line vertically</strong>.</p><p>The trick here is that you have to imagine what shape the line needs to be to hit all three lights at once. If, for example, you just try to pass through the first light, you may undo that work by the time you manipulate the line to hit the third light. Fortunately, <strong>you can adjust the levers to make the wave straightforwardly pass through the three lights in a gradual slope shape</strong>.

That allows for some of the "Tower defense mechanics" <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">mentioned</a> by Gabe Follower, along with "fast travel using floating rails, similar to <em>Bioshock Infinite</em>." The maps reference a "modern steampunk European city (little bit like <em>Half-Life</em>)," after "bad feedback" about a sci-fi theme pushed the development team toward fantasy.</p>

<p>Valve doesn't release games often, and the games it does release are often in development for long periods. <em>Deadlock</em> purportedly started development in 2018, two years before&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> existed. That the game has now seemingly reached a closed (though not closed enough) "alpha" playtesting phase, with players in the "hundreds," could suggest release within a reasonable time. Longtime Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/what-to-make-of-valves-recent-fan-project-takedowns/2/">watcher</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-unreleased-half-life-multiplayer-mod-that-you-can-play-now/">modder</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/recent-valve-vr-update-contains-hidden-half-life-demo-code/">code examiner</a>) Tyler McVicker suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k">in a related video</a> that <em>Deadlock</em> has hundreds of people playing in this closed test, and the release is "about to happen."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>McVicker adds to the descriptor pile-on by noting that it's "team-based," "hero-based," "class-based," and "personality-driven." It's an attempt, he says, to "bring together all of their communities under one umbrella."</p>

<p>Many of Valve's games do something notable to push gaming technology and culture forward. <em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>brought advanced scripting, physics, and atmosphere to the "<em>Doom </em>clones" field and forever changed it. <em>Counter-Strike </em>and <em>Team Fortress 2</em> lead the way in team multiplayer dynamics. <em>Dota 2</em> solidified and popularized MOBAs, and <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> gave VR on PC its killer app. Yes, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(video_game)"><em>Artifact</em></a> moments, but they're more exception than rule.</p>
<p>Following any of those games seems like a tall order, but Valve's track record speaks for itself. I think players like me, who never took to <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Overwatch</em> or the like, should reserve judgment until the game can be seen in its whole. I have to imagine that there's more to <em>Deadlock</em> than a pile of very familiar elements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-ar-loadouts-in-warzone.874515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-ar-loadouts-in-warzone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-ar-loadouts-in-warzone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="226" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">ARs are very well balanced at the moment in <em>Warzone</em>. There isn’t one particular weapon that is significantly better than other options, and several rifles are worth using in standard battle royale matches or Resurgence. </p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone’s</em> long-range meta is usually dominated by LMGs because of their large magazine sizes and powerful damage output. Yet, in <em>Modern Warfare 3’s</em> iteration of <em>Warzone</em>, ARs tend to reign supreme as Resurgence has emerged as the more popular game mode, which has smaller maps that ARs perform better on thanks to their improved mobility. If you are a fan of ARs, here are the best options in Season 3 Reloaded. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best AR loadouts in Warzone, ranked</h2> <h3 id="h-5-bal-27" data-injectable="false">5. BAL-27</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle:&nbsp;</strong>ZEHM35 Compensated Flash Hider</li> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>Crown-H3 Barrel</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel:&nbsp;</strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine:&nbsp;</strong>60 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Stock:&nbsp;</strong>Sandbard Heavy Stock</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Without attachments to help improve recoil, the BAL-27 will feel like it’s bouncing all over the place while firing and too inconsistent to reliably take out an enemy 30 meters away or further. We did our best to mask that deficiency, but this AR still, unfortunately, gets outclassed in that category by other options. With that being said, the&nbsp;<strong>Sandbar Heavy Stock&nbsp;</strong>greatly improves recoil control, gun kick, aiming idle sway, and firing stability. In addition, the&nbsp;<strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip&nbsp;</strong>also checks off all of those boxes to make the AR shoot more predictably.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">4. Kastov 545</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>VT-7 Spirtfire Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>IG-K30 406mm</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Bruen Heavy Suport Barrel </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>60 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Most <em>MW2</em> weapons haven’t quite found a place in <em>Warzone’s</em> meta this year, but the Kastov 545 is a surprisingly consistent weapon that deals enough damage to compete with other popular weapons. Our loadout focuses on improving overall recoil and performance in medium to long-range engagements. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3.SVA 545</h3> <figure data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid </figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>STV Prevision Barrel </li> <li><strong>Ammunition: </strong>5.45 High Grain Rounds </li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 60 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless </li> </ul> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Players can either decide to use the SVA in burst mode or fully-automatic fire. Either way, this AR will shred through enemies and is extremely easy to use. This rifle’s time-to-kill speed doesn’t jump off the page, but the weapon never suffers from a massive drop-off at longer ranges and won’t have any issues going toe-to-toe to with any other top-tier option. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">2.MTZ 556</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle:&nbsp;</strong>L4R Flash hider</li> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>MTZ VLDL-3568 Barrel</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel:&nbsp;</strong>Chewk Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine:&nbsp;</strong>50 Round Drum</li> <li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>MK.3 Reflector</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Our loadout focuses on addressing all areas to round out the MTZ-556. The&nbsp;<strong>L4R Flash Hider</strong>, for example, improves recoil control and gun kick so the versatile AR can extend its range. Then, the&nbsp;<strong>MTZ VLDL-3568 Barrel</strong>&nbsp;improves ADS and sprint-to-fire speeds to make up for what’s lost from the barrel.</p> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">Next, the&nbsp;<strong>Chewk Angled Grip</strong>&nbsp;hits a little bit of everything, improving aiming idle sway, aiming walking speed, and horizontal recoil. With these attachments equipped, this loadout should have no issue taking on opponents up to 30 meters away. Anything else will require the sniper rifle. Finally, a&nbsp;<strong>50-round drum</strong>&nbsp;makes it easier to take on multiple enemies simultaneously, while the&nbsp;<strong>MK.3 Reflector</strong>&nbsp;compensates for poor iron sights.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">1. BP50</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Casus Break</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>LORE-9 Heavy Barrel </li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>DR-6 Handstop </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>45 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>MOAT-40 Stock </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="false">The BP50 is the best AR in <em>Warzone</em> Season 3 Reloaded. According to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the BP50 has the best TTK by a wide margin from 0-15 meters compared to other ARs, and remains fast for most medium range engagements. We don’t recommend using this weapon for any gunfight past 40 meters as there is a massive drop off in damage, but you won’t find a better option for short to mid-range gunfights in this class. </p>

This is according to leaks from playtesters posted on social media earlier today, with some of the details verified by known Valve data miner Tyler McVicker.</p><p>“Since testers started sharing <em>Deadlock</em> screenshots all over the place, here’s ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon,” <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285">McVicker posted on X</a>.</p><p>The post included four screenshots allegedly from the game, which features characters (one of which looks like the Sniper from <em>Team Fortress 2)</em> battling in a city map that seems reminiscent of <em>Half-Life 2’</em>s City 17. Another image shows a hero named Grey Talon and includes the character’s weapon and ability icons with a short description.</p><p><em>Deadlock</em> wasn’t a game Valve gave any indication was in the works, so its reveal is certainly surprising. Earlier this week, McVicker shared <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793">more information about <em>Deadlock</em> on his X page</a>, writing that the game is “fast-paced interesting ADHD gameplay. Combination of<em> Dota 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Smite</em>, <em>Orcs Must Die</em>.” <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p>Though Valve is now mostly known for its PC publishing platform Steam and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">the Steam Deck</a>, the company is still making games. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23893279/valve-counter-strike-2-launch">Valve released <em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>, an update to the perennially popular <em>Counter-Strike GO.</em> Back in 2017, Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell shared that the company was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14578652/valve-vr-games-announced-htc-vive-gabe-newell">working on three “<em>full</em>&nbsp;games” for VR</a>, with one of them being the 2020 hit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>. <em>Deadlock</em> doesn’t seem to be a VR title, so there might be even more secret Valve games looming on the horizon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new claim from a Call of Duty data miner suggests that the next Xbox console could launch as soon as 2026. The console would also feature that year’s Call of Duty as a launch title.</p>



<p>“Hearing from trusted sources that the next Xbox is planned to be released in late 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1791524663807328666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ghost of Hope wrote</a>. “Very likely that COD2026 is a day one release for it.”</p>



<p>Call of Duty 2026 is being developed by Infinity Ward. It’s also worth noting that Ghost of Hope has sources within Activision, which could be where his information is coming from.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Microsoft has gone on record multiple times in saying that a next-generation Xbox console would be coming. In an episode of the official Xbox podcast in February Xbox president Sarah Bond said that the company was exited about what’s coming with future Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>“We’re also invested in the next-generation roadmap,” she said. “What we’re really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation, which makes it better for players and better for creators and the visions that they’re building.”</p>



<p>In April, according to an <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-president-sarah-bond-has-set-up-a-new-team-dedicated-to-game-preservation-and-forward-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal email</a>, she reiterated the company was “moving full speed ahead” on the next system.</p>



<p>As far as a timeline for a next-gen console goes, it was discovered as part of the case investigation Microsoft’s purchase of Activision that the belief was that next-gen consoles from both Microsoft and Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-xbox-series-xxx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t be coming until 2028</a>. The document sourced in the case was from 2022.</p>



<p>In it’s most recent earnings, however, Microsoft says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xboxrevenue-up-and-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox hardware sales were down</a> 31% year over year. That could change the timeline for getting its next console out the door.</p>



<p>Aside from a next-gen system, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-images-of-white-xbox-series-x-all-digital-leaked-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new white Xbox Series X</a> is expected to be released at some point.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that nothing regarding the next generation Xbox console has been confirmed by Microsoft, and likely won’t be addressed. So, with any rumor like this that hasn’t been confirmed or independently verified by Insider Gaming, please take the claims with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>
In news that should be of no surprise to anyone given Fortnite's all-consuming nature, post-apocalyptic RPG series Fallout will soon be making an appearance in the battle royale game.
</p>
<p>
Fallout is, of course, currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">Amazon's recent live-action TV adaptation</a>, making it a prime target for the popularity vampire that is Fortnite.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's impending Fallout collaboration was teased on its <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1791499072789979575">official X account</a>, where a winky face and thumbs-up emoji (squint a bit and it could be Vault Boy) accompanied an image of someone in T-60 power armour staring pensively out of frame amid clouds of belching smoke.

<p>
A little more information was shared in Fortnite itself; as per a caption under the same image in-game, Fortnite's next season - officially titled Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked - is said to come "courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel" when it begins on 24th May. At which point players can probably expect Fallout-themed skins, quests, and whatever else Epic can cook up as all involved look to capitalise on the Bethesda series' recent success.

<p>
Fallout's impending arrival in Fortnite will follow the battle royale game's recent collaborations with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-adds-big-new-star-wars-world-this-week">Star Wars</a> - to celebrate 4th May - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">pop star Billie Eilish</a>. Entities less likely to appear in Fortnite in the coming months include the Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets - which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">fined Epic €1.1m</a>, accusing it of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children" - and rap star Doja Cat, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rap-star-doja-cat-says-only-horrible-and-garbage-players-use-fortnites-most-over-powered-weapon">isn't particularly happy with Epic</a> thanks to Fortnite's Chains of Hades.

But the last version of the dungeon crawling board game, its fourth, was published way back in 2008, well before the modern board gaming Renaissance really began. Now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998290/hasbro-layoffs-before-christmas">Hasbro</a> is bringing it back for a fifth edition. Pre-orders, priced at $59.99, are live now. The game returns to mass market retail on July 1.</p>
<p id="H8wlLh">In <em>Talisman</em>, players take on the role of stock fantasy heroes on the quest for a MacGuffin called the Crown of Command. The highly linear board game takes players round and round a citadel, where they encounter traps and monsters, and even fight against the other players at the table. It’s an unusual hybrid of an action-oriented tabletop role-playing game and something like <em>Candyland</em>, but a novel format that has resonated with generations of casual fans of tabletop games.</p>
<p id="nfoVAo">Polygon reached out to Hasbro following Friday’s press release. They confirmed that the IP hasn’t changed hands. Instead, the game is being produced under license from Games Workshop. Here’s the official description:</p>
<blockquote><p id="7L4wFA">In the game, players set forth on an epic adventure, racing to be the first to obtain a Talisman, reach the Crown of Command in the center of the board, and defeat the elder dragon to win. With a diverse range of characters to choose from and a vast world of possible scenarios plus an easy to use, revised 5<sup>th</sup> Edition Rulebook, this strategy game offers limitless adventures!</p></blockquote>
<p id="3NG3x7">While the game retains the traditional spiral game board, new cover art was revealed showing a crumbling staircase leading to a glowing crown while giant statues of gilded heroes look on. Product photos also show plastic 12 plastic miniatures for each of the 12 included character classes. More information is promised in the weeks ahead. For now, all we have is the gallery of images below.</p>

One is Naoe, a ninja who will don the hood and hidden blade commonly associated with the titular Assassins of Ubisoft’s open-world action franchise.

Grab your hidden blades, it’s time to pit assassins against each other. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-recommend-id="image://426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Altaïr draws his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Altaïr draws his blade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-recommend-id="image://426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Altaïr draws his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Altaïr, the protagonist of the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,<em> </em>was the blueprint (derogatory) for how the franchise would portray its heroes. He was used to establish a format: a modern-day character uses the Animus, a virtual reality simulation, to view the memories of a historical ancestor. But in its first iteration, <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>seemed hesitant to make its hero more than an avatar for Desmond Miles, Altaïr’s modern-day descendant. He’s serviceable as a premise, but as a character? There’s probably a reason Ubisoft ditched him for Desmond’s far more popular ancestor, Ezio, in the sequel. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-recommend-id="image://105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1483" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arno points his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arno points his blade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-recommend-id="image://105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1483" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arno points his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> “Discount Ezio” is the easiest, if not the nicest, way to describe the protagonist of <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity.</em> It’s also accurate. Arno lost his father and was raised by a wealthy family, making his origin similar to Ezio’s. They both do some brooding, too. But while Ezio is a charming vagabond who oozes personality and zest, Arno is the exact opposite. He spends most of <em>Unity </em>moping around, sulking, and being annoying. His story also runs out of steam by the end, but nobody really cares (not even Ubisoft) because everyone understandably forgot about Arno and moved on. -Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-recommend-id="image://d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Connor talks to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Connor talks to someone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-recommend-id="image://d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Connor talks to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poor Connor Kenway, born Ratonhnhaké:ton, he deserved better. <em>Assassin’s Creed III </em>is a mess of a game and the biggest victim is Connor. The son of a Templar and a Native American woman, Connor struggles with his place in the world. While he ultimately ends up an Assassin, he often questions and criticizes the white leaders he’s forced to work alongside. It’s an intriguing setup.</p><p>But, sadly, Connor ends up acting more like a monotone broken record than a real character throughout the game’s main storyline. It doesn’t help that Ubisoft’s decision to make<em> ACIII </em>bigger than any previous game meant that Connor’s arc got covered in sidequests and busy work. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-recommend-id="image://f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1535" data-height="857" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline is perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aveline is perched on top of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-recommend-id="image://f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1535" data-height="857" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline is perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s a shame so few people played as Aveline de Grandpré when <em>Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation</em> launched on the Vita in 2012, because she’s an anomaly for the series even 12 years later. She was the first female protagonist in the series, and unlike future characters, she wasn’t a choice you could simply swap out, or sharing the spotlight with anyone else. <em>Liberation</em> follows her in the 1700s as the daughter of a freed slave who becomes inducted into the Assassin Brotherhood due to her attempts to free and protect slaves. The game makes great use of its period setting, and Aveline’s unique place in it, having her navigate different situations covertly by donning “personas” to blend in with different elements of New Orleans society.</p><p>Thankfully, more people have gotten a chance to play her story in the years since its release on Sony’s handheld, as <em>Liberation </em>has been remastered and ported to every system under the sun. Still, there’s something damning about her resurgence, as it calls attention to the fact that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>has been hesitant to give a character like her sole presence in the spotlight since. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-recommend-id="image://14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob stands in front of a clocktower" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob stands in front of a clocktower" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-recommend-id="image://14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob stands in front of a clocktower" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One half of the Frye twins who headline 2015’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>, Jacob is a likable scoundrel who, frankly, is overshadowed by his even more charismatic and captivating sister. Jacob certainly has his moments of roguish charm, the ability to deploy a winning smile and defuse all the exasperation you were feeling toward him just a moment before. He’s also, at times, a rousing leader, as he attempts to organize the exploited poor of Victorian London and thwart their oppressors. However, Jacob can also come across as a real jerk sometimes, and the fact that <em>Syndicate</em> focuses more and more on him (and less on his sister) as it builds toward its climax feels like a miscalculation. Jacob is…fine, but if one of the Frye siblings had to be second fiddle, it should have been him.—Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-recommend-id="image://8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1101" data-height="620" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cormac points his gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cormac points his gun at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-recommend-id="image://8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1101" data-height="620" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cormac points his gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Most <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> protagonists are heroes, more or less, but Shay Cormac is the big exception. As the star of<em> Assassin’s Creed: Rogue</em>, Shay lets us slide into the boots of someone who joins the Assassins and then leaves for the Templars after he loses faith in the Brotherhood’s motives and leaders.</p><p>What makes Shay such a compelling character is that Ubisoft does a good job of making him sympathetic, and his turn to the Templars seems reasonable. In a series that rarely puts a microscope on the Brotherhood, it’s refreshing to see Shay and his journey. Sure, maybe the Templars are worse, but <em>Rogue </em>and its star, Shay, make the case that the Assassins might not be as noble as the legends and its leaders suggest. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-recommend-id="image://a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eivor wields two axes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eivor wields two axes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-recommend-id="image://a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eivor wields two axes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>’s Viking protagonist has a fair bit of baggage. Eivor is one of the more malleable playable characters in the series, as <em>Valhalla </em>is pretty entrenched in the choice-driven RPG genre that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>has shifted into of late. But Eivor is also one of the weirdest attempts at dealing with canon while giving the player some freedom to make the character their own. Because of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>’s mix of mythology and science fiction, Eivor is an incarnation of Odin, the Norse god. But you can play as either a male or female version of Eivor…only to find out that the male version is just Odin’s DNA being projected through the Animus.</p><p>Ubisoft put this in as a solution to making a specific Eivor “canon,” because now no matter what you do, Eivor was a woman and her male counterpart is just her previous iteration’s DNA confusing the virtual reality technology. But all this late-game twist does is make you ask why <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>can’t have a sole woman as its lead. It even ends up complicating things like its slew of gay romantic relationships for a male Eivor, asserting that they were secretly heterosexual ones the whole time. <em>Valhalla</em>’s choice-driven structures invite the player to define who Eivor can be, only to pull the rug out from under them in the eleventh hour.</p><p>Pushing all the baggage away with all your might, Eivor is a very likable protagonist. She’s caring, loves her clan, and is, interestingly enough, pretty separate from the usual Assassins vs. Templars storyline. I appreciate some of the interesting narrative swings Ubisoft took with her, but Eivor ends up being a case study in how the modern-day framing of historical fiction is both an asset and a disadvantage to the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series this many years in. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-recommend-id="image://5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adéwalé steers a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adéwalé steers a ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-recommend-id="image://5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adéwalé steers a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If it wasn’t for Adéwalé, <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> protagonist Edward Kenway would likely not have joined the Brotherhood at all. So that alone makes it worth giving Adéwalé some extra credit. But Adéwalé is more than just a sidekick of Edward.</p><p>He’s a slave who escaped that nightmare via the pirate’s life and who returns to help other freed slaves. As seen in the fantastic standalone DLC <em>Freedom’s Cry</em>, with Adéwalé’s leadership and skill, this group of freed slaves helped disrupt the slave trade and likely saved many lives in the process. It’s just a shame his adventure was so short. -Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-recommend-id="image://dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basim talks over a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Basim talks over a campfire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-recommend-id="image://dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basim talks over a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Basim Ibn Ishaq was first introduced as a mysterious and possibly dangerous Assassin in <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. </em>And, spoilers for that game, it’s eventually revealed that he’s actually the reincarnated Issu god Loki. Don’t worry about it. Anyway, 2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed: Mirage</em> reveals Basim’s origins, including his early life as a street thief and his journey within the Brotherhood. Throughout <em>Mirage </em>it’s clear that Basim is being manipulated and yet, even as people he trusts betray him, the assassin never stops trying to help people.</p><p>And, like Ezio before him, Basim is a charming rogue, too. The people’s hero. Someone willing to always help the oppressed and fight the power, even if that means the Brotherhood itself. That makes the end of <em>Mirage </em>and Basim’s evolution into a more troubled villain—who appears in <em>Valhalla</em>—all the more painful. He was once better than that. It also makes him one of the more complicated and nuanced protagonists in the franchise. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-recommend-id="image://c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Evie in her assassin clothes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Evie in her assassin clothes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-recommend-id="image://c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Evie in her assassin clothes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I admit, I haven’t played <em>Syndicate </em>since its release almost a decade ago, and I don’t deny that some of my enjoyment of Evie at the time rested in the novelty of her being (at long last!) the first playable female character in a mainline <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game, albeit one who had to share the spotlight with her brother. But there’s more to her greatness than that. Where her hotheaded brother Jacob is reckless and unreasonable, Evie’s ability to stay cool under pressure makes her the real brains of the operation, making it all the more frustrating that the story increasingly focuses on Jacob as it progresses. She’s also genuinely charismatic and likable, which is especially important given how bleak and oppressive the streets of Victorian London can often feel. Evie isn’t naive about the horrible conditions of the city she lives in; far from it, she’s determined to do something about them. But rather than letting the gloom of it all infect her, she stays focused, clever, hopeful, and capable. And her battle-of-wits rapport with her brother is often delightful, leaving little doubt as to who’s the smarter and sharper of the two. Thankfully she wasn’t the <em>last </em>female protagonist in a mainline <em>AC </em>game, but as the first, she proved to be a terrific demonstration of how empty and absurd an excuse for their absence “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.autostraddle.com/ubisoft-cant-have-female-characters-because-women-are-too-difficult-to-animate-one-million-eyes-are-rolled-241278/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.autostraddle.com/ubisoft-cant-have-female-characters-because-women-are-too-difficult-to-animate-one-million-eyes-are-rolled-241278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women are too hard to animate</a></span>” had always been.—Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-recommend-id="image://5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward standing on a ship as a whale passes by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edward standing on a ship as a whale passes by." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-recommend-id="image://5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward standing on a ship as a whale passes by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> holds a special place in fans’ hearts for its sea-faring pirate spin on the franchise. A big part of why that tonal shift works so well is thanks to protagonist Edward Kenway. As a swashbuckling, brash assassin, he’s the opposite of what we’d been taught to expect from this series’ heroes. No sly, subtle shadow operative, he’s more synonymous with bar fights and ship battles reeking of gunpowder. As such, he’s a rollicking, exciting hero to play whether he’s on land or sea, but he also has moments of quiet reflection that round him out. Shoutout to <em>Constantine</em> actor Matt Ryan for capturing the character’s emotional range in his lone video game credit. Get him in more games, I say. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-recommend-id="image://05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1918" data-height="1076" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kassandra readies to deliver a killing stab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kassandra readies to deliver a killing stab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-recommend-id="image://05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1918" data-height="1076" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kassandra readies to deliver a killing stab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em>’s Greek heroes, though distinct characters in the canon, serve the same role in the game regardless of which you choose to play as. Though Kassandra is technically the canonical choice, as per her appearance in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, both embody the same bold, heroic nature. Like Eivor, Kassandra and Alexios are RPG protagonists that are somewhat defined by player choice, but they’re known for their headstrong and witty nature, which makes their heroics and human interactions memorable. Their journey culminates in a stunning final scene in which they survive until the modern day by using the Staff of Hermes. It’s fascinating that Kassandra and Alexios both set things into motion in their prime in Greece, and survive long enough to nudge the course of history once more in the present. They are heroic, charismatic, and some of the most memorable characters in the series. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-recommend-id="image://3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ezio with his hood up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ezio with his hood up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-recommend-id="image://3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ezio with his hood up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s almost impossible not to feel like Ezio Auditore da Firenze epitomizes<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>. First introduced to players in <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em>, the suave Italian stuck around longer than any other protagonist in the series. He got not one, not two, but three mainline games. What makes Ezio so enduring as an<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonist is his undeniable charm and transformative story.</p><p>He starts as an uncaring rich boy and soon finds himself thrust into the path of the order after his father’s death. <em>Assassin’s Creed II </em>gives us the journey we all wanted from an <em>AC </em>game: the one that takes us from nobody to master Assassin. But Ezio’s story doesn’t stop with that. Starring in a trilogy turned Ezio into a much more complex character that players grew with through different stages of his life. It’s what makes his last outing, <em>Revelations</em>, remain so interesting. Whether an old man weighed down by a heavy life or a young brash kid out for revenge, Ezio is human and exceedingly well-portrayed in the series. There will simply never be another protagonist like him. — Willa Rowe</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-recommend-id="image://cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bayek enters a tomb." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bayek enters a tomb." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-recommend-id="image://cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bayek enters a tomb." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As was said in our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813">ranking of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a></span>, <em>Origins</em>’<em> </em>main star, Bayek, is the best protagonist in the franchise’s history. He’s both a nobleman trying to bring justice and peace everywhere he goes and a father mourning the loss of his child. Watching him try to help people while also dealing with so much rage leads to some of the best moments in <em>Origins</em>. It also doesn’t hurt that Bayek is extremely likable, and written with just enough charm and wit that he doesn’t feel like a boring vessel meant only to be controlled by the player.</p><p>Bayek and his wife, Aya, are also very important characters in the <em>AC </em>universe. They both essentially founded what would become the Brotherhood of Assassins out of the grief of losing their son to an evil man, and their journey for revenge would both destroy their relationship and change history forever. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Forty-five minutes to prep a lasagna. Twenty minutes to caramelize some onions. Fifteen minutes to bake cookies. Except in the case of cookie baking speedrunners, that’s actually not as outrageous as it sounds. In fact, it’s way longer than it took Twitch streamer QTCinderella to make a batch of 12 chocolate chip cookies. She completed the task in under four minutes earlier this week, throwing the cookie baking speedrun leaderboard into chaos in the process.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>“I AM THE CURRENT SPEED RUN RECORD HOLDER FOR A DOZEN COOKIES,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790486384953987170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790486384953987170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> on May 14. A snapshot of the Speedrun.com leaderboard showed recent players shredding the previous records, many of which were in the double digits. So how did QTCinderalla, a popular stream who has frequently incorporated baking into her content, including last year’s Master Baker Twitch competitions, manage to bake cookies in under four minutes?</p><p>The record-breaking run required a few significant time-saving tricks. The first was having all of the ingredients pre-measured, including oil substituted for butter. The second was having the oven and baking sheet pre-heated and extra hot. Finally, QTCinderalla used her hands to mix, a cookie scoop to quickly get blobs of dough on the cookie sheet, and then a second cookie sheet smooshed on top to expedite the baking process. It took roughly two minutes to get the confections in the oven and just 96 seconds to cook them to, well, maybe not perfection, but something surprisingly close. “Still moist, not raw, bitch,” she told her stream. “And they taste good!”</p><p>This was all in keeping with the loose rules of the speedrunning challenge, a niche IRL offshoot of the<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fuck-me-i-cant-stop-playing-cookie-clicker-1847794400&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fuck-me-i-cant-stop-playing-cookie-clicker-1847794400"><em>Cookie Clicker</em> PC game category</a></span>. In addition to being completely baked through, the cookies were also more than big enough at over three inches wide each. But not everyone was pleased with the record-setting breakthrough. Shortly after celebrating her victory, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.speedrun.com/cclickermemes/news/13ejp564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.speedrun.com/cclickermemes/news/13ejp564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speedrun.com decided to re-evaluate the category</a></span>. “We are temporarily archiving the IRL baking category in order to reevaluate the rules and come back with a more cohesive and comprehensive set of rules,” moderator TheStrahl wrote on the website. The new rules would codify things like which tools could be used and which cookies would pass the “baked” test.</p><p>“They are afraid of me,” QTCinderella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790560102728278070/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790560102728278070/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> in response.</p><p>“We’re not afraid, just trying to make the rules better before the inevitable shit storm of shitty speedruns you just sent my way,” TheStahl <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheStrahlTTV/status/1790912819606458585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheStrahlTTV/status/1790912819606458585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later responded</a></span>. QTCinderalla wrote back,” Oh so I shouldn’t try to do a speed run on ? Fuck me right? The fun part of speed running is that ANYONE can do it. I think it’s COOL to draw attention to an unknown category. There is no reason to be rude.”</p><p>According to TheStahl, the speedrunning leaderboard gets swamped with spam, trolling, and other nonsense when niche categories blow up like this. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaElKdZsW6N0KcKwF2rcaYFGKFrDHLWqY1zc1mo3JIA/edit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaElKdZsW6N0KcKwF2rcaYFGKFrDHLWqY1zc1mo3JIA/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New rules for the 12 cookie baking speedrun challenge have already been floated</a></span> and they include things like contestants having to measure ingredients during the challenge rather than beforehand and making sure the finished cookies are circles and “as close to round as possible.”</p><p>Things get even more intense after the run is complete and the cookies are tested to make sure they’re properly baked. “First the runner will pick up a cookie to show it is structurally sound,” the new proposed rules read. “The aforementioned cookie must not completely break apart as a result. Show the bottom of the cookie to show that it has browned. The cookie will be broken in half to show that the cookie is cooked internally. Eat cookie.”</p><p>These draft rules may still be revised but they would certainly disqualify QTCinderalla’s existing record. It’s unclear if once they are settled she’ll return to protect her legacy and reclaim her title. What I do know is that the next season of The Great British Bake Off needs to include a speedrunning challenge just like this one. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games just confirmed that between March 15 and May 17, it banned more than 30,000 cheaters from Escape from Tarkov, the (decreasingly) popular extraction shooter. This news might come as a wonder to some, but for those familiar with the product, it’s just another day on the job. These ban waves seem to occur once every month or two, and despite BSG kicking out tens of thousands of cheaters every time, the number never seems to meaningfully decrease.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant">Constant.</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has a long-standing issue with cheaters. It’s a plague that has spoiled the game time and again over the years, and it has put off veteran players from continuing their extraction-based adventures and fully prevented some new players from investing in the platform.</p>



<p>Today, Battlestate Games revealed that in a two-month window, some 30,000 cheaters were banned.</p>



<p>But in March 2024, 33,000 cheaters were revealed to have been banned in two months.</p>



<p>And in January 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-ban-tarkov-cheaters/">11,000 cheaters were banned</a> in two weeks.</p>



<p>And in September 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned/">16,600 cheaters were booted off</a> the platform in one month.</p>



<p>It’s great that we’re getting a rolling tally of the number of cheaters banned, but the figure is either growing or fluctuating wildly. It’s no easy thing to stay ahead of today’s hackers and malicious operators, but it’s arguably <strong>the number one issue </strong>in Escape from Tarkov, and it doesn’t seem to be improving enough to fill players with confidence.</p>



<p>That and the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-conclusion-tarkov-drama/">controversy surrounding ‘The Unheard Edition’</a> is enough to make any Tarkov player baulk at the idea of investing a sizeable amount of time in the game.</p>



<p>Once again, Battlestate Games named and shamed the thousands of cheaters, providing a spreadsheet with the name of every cheater banned from the game in this wave. There are some interesting names on the list, and fans typically scour these pages for the names of big streamers – not that they’d be named by Battlestate, of course…</p>

Ubisoft suggests a SSD for the best experience. Ubisoft's shooter has been a long time coming, having held an open beta last summer only to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-cod-style-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6518278/" data-ref-id="1100-6518278">delayed multiple times</a> despite nearly releasing late last year.

It also features character classes representing factions from other Ubisoft games like Splinter Cell, The Division, and Far Cry. One key way <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">XDefiant looks to set itself apart is by not including skill-based matchmaking</a>, something that has been a hot topic among Call of Duty fans in recent years. It will also feature cross-play and cross-progression across platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-animal-well-1000xresist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry is clearly in a transition period, and even though the full effects won’t be felt for years, we’re already getting hit by reverberations. Triple-A games have been <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few and far between recently</a> while indies have been absolutely flourishing – and getting some much-deserved shine from the press and public. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss why a less triple-A-heavy future might not be such a bad thing.</p><p>Chris, Riley, and I begin by discussing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, which is set in feudal Japan and stars two main characters: a ninja and a samurai. It looks more interesting than the past few games in the series, if nothing else! Of course, since the ninja is a woman and the samurai is black, <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a certain subset of gamers are Big Mad</a>. We (begrudgingly) talk about them, too. Then we move on to<em> </em><a href="https://www.animalwell.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, an unexpected Metroidvania-but-not hit that came out last week. Chris loves it, Riley doesn’t get it. (Gentle) fireworks ensue.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we talk about <a href="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1788599443341599114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent flood of extremely good indie games</a> and how triple-A publishers – who’ve chosen to go all in on a small handful of big hits, <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the expense of everything else</a> – have forgotten how to make these types of games that there’s clearly still a hunger for. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>1000xResist</em></a> is basically a new <em>Nier </em>while <em>Nier</em>’s actual creator is off making gacha games.<em> </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a> is a spiritual successor to <em>Morrowind </em>in the year of our lord 2024. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885110/Cryptmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cryptmaster</em></a><em> </em>is… well, <em>Crypmaster </em>is just cool as hell.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually fund Chris’ idea for a<em> Splinter-Cell</em>-esque spies-versus-mercs-style multiplayer game, except it’s ninja-vs-samurai and it’s set in feudal Japan. It practically sells itself!</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think [<em>Animal Well</em>] hits at the right time, which is – narratively, I guess – indies are having a bigger moment now specifically because of the environment that we’re in. Because big companies don’t know how to handle small-to-medium-sized games anymore. And so, to just have this one drop and to be like “Oh, this is a perfect game. What was stopping [bigger companies] from doing that?” Particularly relative to all the Microsoft shit and the Square Enix shit, where they don’t know how to market these small and medium-sized games.&nbsp;</p><p>You had a great week this week of indie titles – more than I could play. I actually tried to play all of them. I was playing <em>Cryptmaster</em> earlier, and that game is so fucking good. That game is really funny. There’s just a lot of games out. There’s a lot of bangers in a row. And it just comes at a time when it doesn’t seem like any big publisher knows what the fuck they’re doing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think it’s [a byproduct of] something we saw a lot this week with Square and Ubisoft and with some earnings reports last week. All these companies are like “We’re pivoting to less games.” And you have in contrast to that all these killer indies, and a big company can’t just say “Let’s do that!” I’m sure there’s somebody in a room somewhere demanding Ubisoft’s <em>Balatro </em>or whatever the heck. But are the big companies lumbering in the wrong direction, or is it <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Luke’s article posited</a>: Have indies kind of– I don’t want to say risen to fill a gap, because they’ve always existed. But what is it that’s letting this moment happen?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> If there was a big, forgettable release right now, would we be caring about [these games]?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> But there have been, though. What happened to <em>Rise of the Ronin</em>? That came and went, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, that came out the exact same day as <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>. That was just really bad timing on their part. Also, it’s a medium-sized game.</p><p>But yeah, <em>Crow Country</em>, <em>Animal Well</em>…</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <em>Cryptmaster</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>…</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong><em>1000xResist</em>, which I did play a little bit of, though not enough to really give it an assessment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> People say good stuff about it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, people are saying wildly good stuff. Some are saying it’s one of the best games ever.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s weird! I said it looks almost like <em>Second Life</em>. I don’t say that in a negative way, but it looks like some shit made in Unity. Not in a bad way; it has this affect of [being] sort of a narrative, <em>Nier</em>-type of game about the experience of diaspora. It has this high concept of going back into digital memories, and there’s clearly a lot there. It looks really interesting. It’s like if the kind of lesbian that wears Fox Racing gear to raves talked only in riddles. It’s like “I don’t actually know what you’re saying, but it’s fascinating.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s definitely got that sort of queer <em>Nier Automata</em> affect to it, but done in an indie game. Which I also like because it’s like, Yoko Taro’s not gonna make a <em>Nier </em>game; we’ve got one at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I find it all interesting because there’s clearly room for these games, and there’s clearly hunger for these games. But then you have Square Enix, who had this strategy for a while of putting out some smaller games, and a lot of those games I think found audiences. People clearly love a lot of them, like <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. But those games did not meet “sales expectations.” And of course Square Enix has always been really bad at predicting these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But you have these companies that could create a lot of these smaller games. They have the means to do it, but it’s not going to please their shareholders enough. And so they’re pivoting to these much bigger games that represent this kind of horrible roll of the dice. It’s like “Well, if this game succeeds at the scale we hope it will and expect it to, then we have our big hit – our <em>Fortnite</em>-sized, decade-lasting hit.” But if not, that is hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain. You’ve got to lay tons of people off. You’re basically done. They’re betting it all on these titanic projects, and that just doesn’t seem wise.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The shit that makes me so mad about Square Enix is, their strategy of exclusivity was always going to be a bad idea. That was always going to bite them in the ass, particularly given the install base of the PS5. On top of that, they just don’t know how to market stuff. I know that’s an easy excuse, but they don’t try. I think that if you gave <em>Harvestella </em>to Atlus, they would have known how to deal with that. That would have been an interesting game for them to pitch. Square Enix was just not a good shepherd of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Because I hate myself a little bit – or like inflicting pain on myself – I went back and read a year-end review from the president of Square Enix. And it starts like “This was the year of the metaverse” and then proceeds to lay out all the shit they wasted time, energy, and money on for the last three years: crypto scams, NFTs, AI horseshit. Every hit you can think of – of a scam or a bad idea – they’ve been really into. What if you spent any of that time marketing these little games? Maybe you would be in less of a bad place than you are now. Maybe if you weren’t banking on a trilogy that takes ten years to make, of one game with an increasingly smaller install base and fewer people that are on board every single time, maybe you wouldn’t have this issue. But they’re baking on this [less is more] strategy, and I think it’s not going to work out for them. I think it’s going to be a bad idea – just the shortsightedness of it all.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s sad on one hand, because we are going to miss out on a lot of these smaller, more inventive games that Square Enix was making. But I guess the upside – and we’re seeing it in real time – is that other people will make games like that. Other people will take the reins and go from there. They’ll be indies, and they’ll be different. Instead of another Nier, it’s gonna be <em>1000xResist</em>, which definitely doesn’t look as big-budget, but if the ideas are there and the game is fun to play, then are we really losing that much?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I like all these indie games. I’ve definitely hit that age where shorter, smaller games are definitely more my speed than “Here’s some 60-hour big-budget thing that strains the limits of my PC.” It’s exciting too, now that we have Aftermath, that we can write about these games without stressing out as much – which isn’t to say that we didn’t write about them at our other sites. But it was always a bit of a harder proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>More different things, as opposed to fewer big things from big companies, just seems great to me. What does it mean for the broader industry? All these companies are having layoffs, and they employ far more people than a developer making an indie game. But I think it’s a good thing [for games], mostly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beloved board game from Japan is coming overseas. Not a localization of a popular TTRPG like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west"><em>Bouken</em></a>, or a translated licensed work like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/shin-megami-tensei-ttrpg-finally-gets-english-localization"><em>Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne</em> TTRPG</a>. It is an official English-language of the <em>Ito</em> card game, courtesy of publisher Arcane Wonders.</p>

<h2>The <em>Ito</em> Card Game English Localization Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Ito</em> card game is a wildly popular, easy-to-learn cooperative card game. It is designed by Mitsuru Nakamura and has gained over 300,000 fans in its native region.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ito-card-game-component-screenshot.jpg?itok=izMn2p2B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ito-card-game-component-screenshot.jpg?itok=QL04Hsyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, is it a prime number or is it double digits?</figcaption></figure><p>In <em>Ito</em>, each player is given a secret number. This number can be between 1 and 100. From here, players need to work together to put their secret numbers in order on the board. Each player can provide clues to one another about what number is theirs based on several categories. They cannot directly tell their teammates their number.</p>

<p>The English localization of the Ito card game carries a mark of status. Not only is Arcane Wonders publishing the game for English-speaking territories, it will be distributed under their Dice Tower Essentials line. This is a curated line of board game whose titles include <em>Onitama</em>, <em>Aquatica</em>, and <em>Smartphone Inc. </em></p>

<p>The Dice Tower Essentials line titles are handpicked by prolific board game reviewer Tom Vaesel, the same Tom Vaesel behind The Dice Tower podcast and designer of <em>Vicious Fishes</em> and the <em>Nothing Personal</em> series.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We are incredibly excited to partner with Arclight Games to bring <em>Ito</em> to a global audience," said Robert Geistlinger, President of Arcane Wonders. "We believe that <em>Ito</em> perfectly embodies the spirit of the Dice Tower Essentials line of games. Its engaging gameplay and universal appeal make it a perfect addition to any gamer's collection."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The English version of the <em>Ito</em> card game will retain all of the elements that made the original game great. In addition, it will add cards to randomize category selection. The game is set to make its English debut October 2024.</p>

            <p>Microsoft is poised to add the newest Call of Duty series entry to Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c">As reported by The Wall Street Journal</a>, the decision aims to bring new subscribers to the service.</p>
<p>The publication adds that consumers will still have the option of purchasing the new shooter for seperately PC or consoles.</p>
<p>The announcement to add the latest Call of Duty to Game Pass is expected <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-9-news-in-brief">during next month's Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-blizzard-expects-to-add-games-to-game-pass-next-year">Word of the first-person shooter series coming to the service was expected</a> following the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Back in October 2023, the company said on social media, "While we do not have plans to put Modern Warfare 3 or Diablo 4 into Game Pass this year, once the deal closes, we expect to start working with Xbox to bring our titles to more players around the world."</p>
<p>Regarding other Activision Blizzard titles joining Game Pass, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/03/26/need-to-know-diablo-4-with-game-pass">Diablo 4 was added to the catalog back in March</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-actors-in-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If someone asks you what your favorite <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-spy-movies">spy movie</a> is, it’s nearly impossible to keep James Bond from coming to mind. With gadgets, gizmos, guns, girls, and goons, James Bond is the gallant good guy who introduced the global audience to the thrill of on-screen espionage. Though the world has had time to reflect on the shortcomings of this flawed character and his over-the-top machismo, Bond remains one of the most exemplary and immortal characters to ever exist in modern media. Though James Bond has been present in film (and literature) for 70+ years, there seems to be no end in sight as new actors for new iterations are considered for the role every decade or so. As of late, many up-and-coming stars are being considered to reprise the role but it seems the prestigious protagonist has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aaron-taylor-johnson-reportedly-offered-james-bond-role">offered to MCU star Aaron Taylor-Johnson</a>.</p><h2>How many James Bond Actors are There?</h2><p>The most iconic movie spy of all time, James Bond has been portrayed by multiple actors since his film debut in 1962. There are a total of 7 actors who have played the role of our beloved spy: Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig. All have brought their own unique twist to the character and all are worthy of mention in this article. </p><h3><strong>1. Sean Connery – 1962 - 1967, 1971, 1983</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/10/31/0-signed-photo-of-sean-connery-posing-as-james-bond-1280x720-1604162798616.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sean Connery </figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Films</strong>: Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, Never Say Never Again (Non-EON production)</p><p>Best known for his role as James Bond (despite having almost 100 acting credits on IMDB), Connery is undoubtedly the best and most favored to have ever portrayed the slick, sexy spy. Though Connery very much earned the title, being the first to step into these metaphorically gigantic shoes must have been more like tailor-made dress shoes for him. Starring in what are, to this day, a few of the best Bond movies of all time (Goldfinger, Dr. No), the story of his success after these films is no mystery to unravel. </p><h3><strong>2. David Niven – 1967</strong></h3><p><strong>Films</strong>: Casino Royale (Non-EON production)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/david-niven-1696614100299.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>David Niven </figcaption></figure></output><p>A truly one-of-a-kind portrayal comes from the comedic prowess of David Niven: an unfortunately, largely forgotten role from a top-line British actor. As the only spoof movie on this list, Niven stands out in uniqueness but falls short due to the absolutely polarizing tone of this one-off film. While this film garnered a cult following over the years despite its critical reception, fans of Bond are quick to forget it amongst the crowd. </p><h3><strong>3. George Lazenby – 1969</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/10/13/george-lazenby-1665702898966.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>George Lazenby</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Films</strong>: On Her Majesty's Secret Service</p><p>The only actor to portray Bond only once – in a serious role, that is – is George Lazenby: an unjustly hated replacement for Sean Connery at the time. While his acting was indeed in the lower rankings of the 7 iterations, the immediate hatred he received even before the film's release ensured his fate as a one-and-done James Bond. Over 50 years after its release, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service has been hailed as more of a gem to audiences than had been originally perceived. Some even say that, at its core, it is one of the best Bond films but give little credit to poor George. </p><h3><strong>4. Roger Moore – 1973 - 1985</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/10/13/roger-moore-1665702959820.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Roger Moore</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Films</strong>: Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill</p><p>Holding the record for most Bond films starred in, Roger Moore steps in for an impressive 12-year, 7-film streak as James Bond. Though the quality of the films he starred in greatly varies, Moore became a pill much easier for audiences and fans to swallow. Bringing more of a cheeky, goofy quality to the character, the average Roger Moore Bond film is noticeably more campy than the Sean Connery predecessors but ultimately checks all the boxes that a Bond film should. </p><h3><strong>5. Timothy Dalton – 1987 - 1989</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/10/13/timothy-dalton-1665703022269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Timothy Dalton</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Films</strong>: The Living Daylights, License to Kill</p><p>One of the more arguably underrated actors to portray Bond is Timothy Dalton: Mr. Eyebrows himself. While he ultimately undersold audiences resulting in his measly two-film streak, Dalton brought a quality of darkness to the character that would change the tone of Bond films forever. As usual, the focus is always on the actor portraying the character rather than the film itself, which is why these two arguably underrated Bond films have been largely overlooked – probably also since License to Kill has been quite a popular film title since. </p><h3><strong>6. Pierce Brosnan – 1995 - 2002</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/10/13/pierce-brosnan-1665702819372.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pierce Brosnan</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Films</strong>: GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day</p><p>Commonly referred to as the second best (for some, <em>the</em> best) actor to play Bond, Pierce Brosnan with his sharp looks and undeniable charm was almost immediately accepted by viewers and critics alike. Helped along by the nearly-perfected Bond film formula, Pierce combined all the greatest things about past iterations and made it his own. Though the films are a bit over-the-top at times, the representation of all Bond film elements can be seen through a whole new lens that makes them truly unique. </p><h3><strong>7. Daniel Craig – 2006 - 2021</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/12/07/skyfall-daniel-craig-as-james-bond-with-aston-martin-db5jpg-0d6973.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Daniel Craig</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Films</strong>: Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre, No Time to Die</p><p>Another actor to be severely criticized even before his first Bond film release, Daniel Craig has since carved out his very own, very special streak of Bond films that are now seen as a great re-imagining of what Bond films can be. As the first series of Bond movies to follow a clear chronological order and continuation of events, Craig was given the rare chance to develop this character into a dark, embittered, lonely narrative with an earth-shattering conclusion. These films also broke the fourth wall a bit by cementing the concept into the canon that 007 is just a number: when he is gone, another comes to take his place as 007. </p><h2>How to Watch the James Bond Movies in Order</h2><p>If you’re looking for a more detailed list of how to watch all of the movies by actor or release date, look no further than our guide to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-movies-in-order">James Bond movies in order</a>. While most of the Bond films do not follow a continued narrative throughout the timeline, it’s still very useful to have a full list of all the Bond films, their release dates, and who is starring in each one.</p><p><em>Connor Sheppard is an Oregon-grown culture writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24159055/summer-gaming-events-xbox-showcase-nintendo-direct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">corpse of E3 lies a-mouldrin’ in its grave</a>, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft">spirit marches on</a> in the form of a bevy of video game showcases and events. There’s a hefty number of them — some notable, some not (but they should be) — and they encompass a wide range of games and genres. Here’s your guide to the whats, wheres, and whens of this year’s summer of games.</p><p><h3><a href="https://access-ability.uk/2023/11/17/access-ability-summer-showcase-2024-announcement/">Access-Ability Summer Showcase 2024</a>&nbsp;</h3></p><p>Accessibility has become a major feature of games, with developers often incorporating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/3/23668538/sony-playstation-store-accessibility-tags-ps5">accessibility features in their marketing materials</a>. The Access-Ability Showcase takes that one step further, curating an entire digital event around games with robust accessibility features. “Our aim is to make sure that if a game looks exciting, you don’t have to worry about getting hyped, only to learn later that a game doesn’t support your needs as a player,” wrote Laura Kate Dale, host of the Access-Ability showcase. The showcase starts on June 7th at 11AM ET on <a href="http://twitch.tv/LauraKBuzz">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FYoutube.com%2FLauraKBuzz">YouTube</a> and will feature viewing options for American and British sign language and audio descriptions.<br></p><p><h3><a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">Summer Game Fest</a></h3></p><p>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest was one of the first on the scene to take over when E3 started foundering during the covid-19 pandemic. This is the fourth year of Keigh-3, and it has only gotten bigger with this year’s event boasting over 55 gaming partners, including the big hitters like Xbox and Playstation to smaller outfits like Annapurna Interactive and Thunderful Games. You can watch the main showcase on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40thegameawards">YouTube</a> on Friday, June 7th, at 5PM ET.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/events/">Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition 2024</a></h3></p><p>Immediately following the Summer Game Fest presentation, iam8bit and Double Fine Productions are hosting the SGF edition of their Day of the Devs showcase. Day of the Devs is one of my favorite parts of Summer Game Fest since it always exposes me to games I’ve never heard of before that quickly become my favorites. In 2022, that’s how I heard about <em>A Little to The Left</em>, <em>Escape Academy</em>, and <em>Desta: The Memories Between</em>. It also was one of the first showcases that featured a little game called <em>Animal Well —</em> maybe you’ve heard of it. Make sure you tune in to the Day of the Devs showcase on June 7th at 7PM ET on Twitch and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40DayoftheDevs">YouTube</a> so you can find your next indie obsession.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fevents%2Fxbox-games-showcase">Xbox&nbsp;Games&nbsp;Showcase</a></h3></p><p>Just a few days after the main Summer Game Fest showcase, Xbox will host its own event on Sunday, June 9th, starting at 1PM ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fxbox">YouTube</a>. Though Xbox just held an indie partner showcase in April, debuting a handful of interesting indie titles — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144596/theyre-just-giving-away-toes-for-free">including this one about Japanese mascots</a> — this showcase promises to be much bigger. Xbox is incorporating all its studios, including the recently acquired Activision, so expect a bunch of heavy-hitter AAA games from the biggest studios in the world. After Sunday’s event, Xbox is also teasing a second showcase it’s dubbed a “[REDACTED] Direct.” Though the company is trying to be coy, it’s widely rumored <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145262/xbox-games-showcase-summer-2024-call-of-duty-direct">that the [REDACTED] in question is the latest <em>Call of Duty </em>game</a>. There’s also a chance Xbox will share more information on the report that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans">this next <em>Call of Duty</em> will be added to Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://wholesomegames.com/">Wholesome Direct 2024</a></h3></p><p>If the high-energy / high-action games featured in the bigger showcases aren’t your thing (and even if they are), then the Wholesome Direct may have what you’re looking for. The Wholesome Direct features games that are, according to the event’s curators, “incredibly hopeful, artistic, and creative.” Last year’s Wholesome Direct featured<em> Venba</em>, and the game’s creators credit (<a href="https://x.com/venbaGame/status/1668407220411805696">literally</a>) being featured in the showcase as a major factor in their success. Watch the Wholesome Direct on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wholesome_games">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fc%2FWholesomeGames">YouTube</a> on Saturday, June 8th, at 12PM ET. </p><p><h3><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-pc-gaming-show-2024-announcement/">PC Gaming Show</a></h3></p><p>The PC Gaming Show, hosted by <em>PC Gamer</em>, is a showcase that was initially designed to address the lack of PC gaming representation during E3. Ten years after its debut, it’s still going strong with the showcase taking place June 9th at 4 PM ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pcgamer">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fpcgamer">YouTube</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fnextfest%23%3A~%3Atext%3DSteam%2520Next%2520Fest%2520will%2520take%2Cwhen%2520Steam%2520Next%2520Fest%2520begins.">Steam Next Fest</a> </h3></p><p>Like the PC Gaming Show, Steam Next Fest is all about the games <em>not</em> on Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo Switch. (Although some of the games featured during Next Fest might also be on those consoles, too.) Steam Next Fest does its presentation a bit differently, though. It lasts for a full week, giving gamers access to demos of forthcoming games, livestreamed developer interviews, and deep dives on the games featured. Next Fest starts June 10th at 1PM ET and lasts until June 17th, so you have plenty of time to check everything out. </p><p><h3><a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fforward">Ubisoft Forward 2024</a></h3></p><p>Ubisoft Forward returns for Summer Game Fest 2024. Ubisoft will share updates on its games on June 10th at 3PM ET. We should expect more details about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, the second season of <em>Skull and Bones</em>, and more.</p><p><h3>Nintendo Direct</h3></p><p>Buried in all the speculation regarding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">Nintendo’s next console and when it will be revealed</a> was a message from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about the next Nintendo Direct. “We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024,” <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197">he said in a post on X</a>. Though there’s no specific date attached to the Direct, we should probably expect it around the same time as all the Summer Game Fest activities since Nintendo likely won’t want to be left out of all the fun.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en">Gamescom 2024</a></h3></p><p>Rounding out this year’s summer of games is Gamescom 2024. The event is kinda like the European version of E3 and will feature its own showcase event similar to the keynote addresses of E3s past. Gamescom kicks off on Wednesday, August 21st (my birthday!), and lasts until August 25th, with the Opening Night Live showcase, hosted by Geoff Keighley, typically taking place during the week, time TBD.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series has been dormant since 2007, so fans haven’t been able to pit a lot of modern rappers against one another in a fighting game. But this <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>mod is a decent enough substitute. The Def Jam MK1 Pack has two options to play as Lamar, one makes the “Not Like Us” rapper a skin for Reiko, and the other lets you play as him as a skin for Kung Lao. Drake, meanwhile, is a skin for Johnny Cage.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Mortal Kombat 1:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Kombat-1-PlayStation5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C5S14X7Q/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-drake-kendrick-lamar-mod-beef-feud-1851485363&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0C5S14X7Q" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/ckYyMqhSH8B&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/ckYyMqhSH8B" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>The Drake vs. Kendrick beef has been entertaining to watch unfold and I don’t think I’ve ever seen people be so unified online.

In the northeastern quadrant of the map, you’ll encounter a large chameleon that, among other things, can defeat you in one hit using its tongue. With some trial and error, you can figure out how to overcome this big old lizard and continue exploring. Or, if you don’t have time for that, you can find out exactly what you need to do below.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>For those who just need a few quick hints, you’ll have to face off against the chameleon twice in <em>Animal Well</em>. In the first encounter with the green chameleon, your goal is to press the three yellow buttons and pass through the gate beneath it. Use the grass as bait to survive its tongue attacks. In the second encounter with the red chameleon, you’ll have to bait it into eating the hedgehogs on the platform. This will defeat the chameleon once and for all, which will net you one of the four flames required to beat the first layer of the game.<br></p><p>Of course, there’s a bit more to these encounters than that.

The first—and by far the most dangerous—is its tongue attack. It will extend its tongue towardswherever you’re standing at the time the attack starts, and it will eat up the first applicable thing it touches (unless it strikes nothing at all). If it eats you, that’s an instant game over. Fortunately, you’ll notice that there are several patches of grass on the ground. <strong>If you hide underneath the grass, the chameleon will grab the greenery instead and leave you safe</strong>.</p><p>Granted, you don’t <em>need</em> the grass to dodge this attack either. The trajectory of the tongue is decided once the attack begins, so you can jump or move out of the way after it reaches out to you for a snack. This is especially helpful once you need to ride the floating platform above you, since your perpetual motion will make you a harder target for the boss to hit.</p><figure id="" data-id="72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-recommend-id="image://72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The chameleon's eyes turn red, and it uses its projectile attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The chameleon's eyes turn red, and it uses its projectile attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shared Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-recommend-id="image://72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The chameleon's eyes turn red, and it uses its projectile attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chameleon will telegraph its second attack when its eyes turn red, which will coincide with a distinct gurgling sound effect. After a short pause, the chameleon will fire four projectiles from its eyes that will follow a set trajectory onto the ground. This is a much easier attack to dodge, and it won’t trigger its tongue move during this time.</p><figure id="" data-id="733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-recommend-id="image://733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player dodges the chameleon and uses the yo-yo to press a button." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player dodges the chameleon and uses the yo-yo to press a button." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shared Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-recommend-id="image://733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player dodges the chameleon and uses the yo-yo to press a button." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for pressing those three buttons, you can easily reach the two on the bottom side of the screen using the Yo-Yo. You can manipulate the chinchilla and jump on it to press the buttons as well, but that’s obviously a slower option. Afterwards, use the chinchilla to jump onto the small platform under the chameleon, and wait for an opening to ride the floating platform above over to the last button. It may feel scary to get so close to the chameleon, but remember, you can use the grass as cover. Just don’t hang out after it eats all the grass there.</p><p>After you press the final button, make a dash toward the gate and pass on through.

Instead, you want to use what you learned from the previous encounter to <strong>bait the chameleon into eating the hedgehogs</strong>. The easiest way to do this is to <strong>tap the left button in front of any of the hedgehogs, inching forward at roughly the speed at which they walk</strong>. This will naturally goad the chameleon into trying to snack on you, only to catch a hedgehog instead. <strong>You’ll need it to eat all five hedgehogs to win</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="09742a2cb1e2b2e867b433ea8720836a" data-recommend-id="image://09742a2cb1e2b2e867b433ea8720836a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player plays the animal flute to stop the hedgehog.

As you get down to the last hedgehog, you may find it hard to line it up with the chameleon when it’s trying to use its tongue attack.

This will momentarily stop the hedgehogs until you stop playing, which can help you control the flow of the encounter.</p><p>That said, I can’t stress this point enough: <strong>Make sure to only use the Animal Flute when the hedgehogs are on top of the platform</strong>.

<p>In a post on X (that’s the first time I’ve referred to it as that), Epic Games teased an impending Fallout-themed update to Fortnite, the legendary battle royale game. In a simple post, we see the bust of a suit of power armour, a figure that has been all over our screens since the Fallout TV show was released on April 10.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a reference in the game’s news feed suggested that the Brotherhood of Steel – the most recognisable faction in the Fallout universe – will help to usher in Chapter 5, Season 3, which is set to be released on May 24.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-but-how">Fallout, But How?</h2>



<p>That’s all there is to know about the upcoming Fallout crossover event in Fortnite. It hasn’t been confirmed in what capacity the crossover will work, and it could be anything from full-blown skins to music, emotes, and backbling bundles. It’s easy to imagine a collaboration between Bethesda Game Studios and Epic Games that would see the Amazon-backed Fallout TV show ported into the world of Fortnite.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For instance, I could imagine a variety of skin packs including the three core characters from the recently released television show: Lucy, Maximus, and The Ghoul (Cooper). They’d fit very nicely in the world of Fortnite, given that they all have signature weapons, tropes, and even quips. If I were a betting man, I’d say that’s what’s on the way from May 24.</p>



<p>Keep a weather eye on the horizon – the Brotherhood of Steel is coming to Fortnite, and who knows what else?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now," the executive <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693998-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Previously, GTA VI was set for release at an unspecified point in 2025, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-now-set-for-fall-2025/1100-6523520/" data-ref-id="1100-6523520">now it's lined up to launch specifically in Fall 2025</a>. It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">pretty much every Rockstar Games release gets delayed</a>, so it's possible GTA VI might slip like GTA V and Red Dead Redemption II did before it.</p><p>Also during the call, Take-Two management said the company expects to have sequential growth following the release of GTA VI, which struck some as odd or even unbelievable. That's because GTA VI is expected to generate an enormous amount of money for Take-Two, making for a difficult comparison during the next fiscal year. An analyst pointed out that Take-Two experienced sequential declines following the launches of GTA V and Red Dead Redemption II. So how will things be different this time? Zelnick said "it's a fair question," going on to note that the video game business has "really changed" since Red Dead Redemption II and GTA V came out years ago.</p><p>He said Take-Two will post sequential growth due to the company's pipeline of titles that includes other major releases (though he did not name any outright). He also said he expects GTA VI to keep selling well for years after launch, just as GTA V did and continues to. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-gta-6-approaches-gta-5-passes-200-million-copies-sold/1100-6523542/" data-ref-id="1100-6523542">in the past three months of 2024, GTA V sold another 5 million copies</a>, which is more than most games sell in their lifetimes.</p><p>"We actually think there is a compelling case that the full game sales [of GTA VI] will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline both announced and unannounced that's very exciting," he said, further noting that Take-Two now owns Zynga, which brings in tons of money on a level the company didn't have when GTA V and Red Dead Redemption II released.</p><p>Not only that, but Zelnick pointed out how Take-Two plans to expand its business to new geographies. He said Take-Two currently mainly does most of its business in the US and Western Europe, but he believes there are "enormous opportunities" for growth in Asia, India, and Africa.</p><div tabindex="0"

was pressed to answer why Take-Two has so much confidence that GTA VI will be a hit. There is obviously a huge amount of hype behind the game, but Zelnick also reminded everyone that the data shows astonishing ongoing growth for GTA V and GTA Online more than a decade after the game came out.</p><p>"I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers," Zelnick said.</p><p>Finally, Zelnick said GTA VI has the makings of being another big hit because the current-generation console market is already big and growing bigger still. Citing data from IDG, Zelnick said there are around 81 million current-generation consoles sold, with projections for 111 million by the end of 2024 and 175 million by the end of 2027.</p><p>Zelnick said he doesn't necessarily believe these numbers and projections will turn out to be accurate, but he does believe the console market is still growing. He also pointed out how he expects GTA VI to have a "very significant attach rate" for consoles. Zelnick was asked if GTA VI might help draw lapsed gamers back to the market, but he did not answer this question outright.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more GTA VI news as it's announced.</p>

Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.</p>

<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/five-nights-at-freddys-2-release-date-december-2025-1236006597/">Variety</a></em>, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including <em>M3GAN 2.0</em> and <em>The Black Phone 2</em>. It's not surprising to see <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em> getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/11/27/five-nights-at-freddys-continues-box-office-success-becomes-highest">Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever</a>, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tagline<i> </i>for <i>Five Nights At Freddy's 2 </i>reads<i>,</i> "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>FNAF 2</em> won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em>, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/mortal-kombat-2-movie-gets-october-2025-release-date">recently confirmed</a> to release in October of that year.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/17/steamworld-heist-ii-announced-and-it-launches-august-8th/">SteamWorld Heist II was announced</a> last month, much to many people’s surprise. Today, Thunderful Games has released a new video that delves into the story of the pirate themed sequel, which comes nine years after the first SteamWorld Heist originally released for the Nintendo 3DS, which was set in Space.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Story Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7xT0nemVpc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SteamWorld Heist II is set on the Great Oceanic Shard, a remnant of the shattered planet that revolves around its core. The water of the Shard sea are essential for the survival of the SteamWorld residents, who need it to keep running. However, the water is becoming corrosive and dangerous for everyone that relies on though no one knows why. Captain Quincy Leeway is more concerned about the location of his submarine, rather than the Royal Navy’s strict control over the Shard sea’s water.</p>
<p>Captain Leeway is the character players will be controlling in between missions, travelling around the Shard recruiting new members to the crew, as well as upgrading them too. Quincy has one arm and is not playable in missions, with the crew instead taking on the jobs instead. You will start with a couple of crewmates including Daisy, who is loyal to Quincy, and Wesley, who is seeking an honourable death in battle.</p>
<p>The world of Steamworld Heist II is a mystery, covering in fog until you go into areas, so you will not know what you are going into at first. The Royal Navy patrols the sea too, and is a danger to players as these ships will attack without warning. The world is also split between the warm Caribia sea and the cold Arctica sea. In Arctica, it is the Rattler faction that pose the danger to players. Combat is key to surviving on the sea, and your submarine will deal damage when lining up against enemy ships, however some enemies are very powerful. If you lose a battle and become shipwrecked, you will respawn at the last bar you visited. The submarine can be upgraded too with more powerful weapons and armour, an engine that allows for more speed, and an upgrade to dive under the waves.</p>

<p>Steamworld Heist II will be released on August 8th for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.</p>

There are a few reasons. For one, it opens the console up, letting you freely back up game installs and saves. You can also run emulators on the PS4 and play your installed games without a disc. And yes, some people are pirating new games and playing them on these hacked consoles, too. But we are not here to talk about that. Instead, I want to share a strange way people are jailbreaking PS4s. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackaday.com/2024/05/16/you-can-now-jailbreak-a-ps4-with-an-lg-tv/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/05/16/you-can-now-jailbreak-a-ps4-with-an-lg-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>HackADay.com</em></a></span>, a recently created method for jailbreaking a PS4 involves plugging it into a jailbroken LG smart TV. (And yes, in case you didn’t know about this already, people are jailbreaking smart televisions, too.) Once you’ve hacked your LG TV, you install a digital tool onto the TV and hook your PS4 up to it using an ethernet cable. Then run the exploit tool on the TV and set up a LAN connection on the PS4...and that’s it. At that point, the tool should work its magic and you’ll soon have a jailbroken PS4.</p><p>This new tool is built upon the work of other modders and hackers who were able to figure out new ways to jailbreak Sony’s last-gen console. And to be clear, I’m not suggesting you go buy an LG TV, jailbreak it, and then use that device to hack your PS4 and start downloading pirated games. </p><p>But being able to take full control of expensive electronic devices, like phones, TVs, and consoles, is something that we should all support as it allows these pieces of tech to be useful long after their corporate owners have moved on. </p><p>And based on what a lousy job <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-some-video-games-are-in-danger-of-disappearing-fore-1789609791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-some-video-games-are-in-danger-of-disappearing-fore-1789609791">video game companies</a></span> have been doing at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857">preserving old (or even fairly new) games</a></span>, in 20 years or so, a modded PS4—jailbroken using a TV—might be the easiest way to play digital games you bought years ago but lost access to because the servers were killed. And what a story to tell the grandkids as you hide from the Facebook and Google AI drones looking to hunt down the last humans alive.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
