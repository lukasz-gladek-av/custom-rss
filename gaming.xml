Remedy's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> will be an "action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>", the developers have announced, and while I have already caved and written it up, I'm not sure this is really news. Wasn't the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn't every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn't have RPG-style elements. No wait, don't actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news comes care of Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">latest investor presentation</a>, from which the studio have helpfully lifted a few titbits and <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094">posted them on social media</a>. Amongst other things, we learn that Control will receive a free update next year, unlocking some previously released stuff (is it too much to hope that they'll give away one of the paid DLC packs?) and that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now sold 1.8 million units, bless him. There's some discussion in the Twitter thread as to whether Control 2 being an action-RPG is really such a highlight - the developers insist on calling it "brand new information" in a reply. 
</p>
<p>
That sour electric aroma you can smell is the collective anxiety-stench of games journalists trying to decide whether it's worth sitting through the full investor presentation in the hopes of discovering some proper context for these pitiful morsels  - perhaps even a unique angle which none of those <em>other</em> hacks have discovered, the feckless layabouts. It's two hours of people preaching about ROI, though, and there's the terrible suspicion that you might get to the end and realise that it was all for naught, and that you are two hours closer to death with no headline quote to show for it. Damn you, Roi, why do you mock me so?
</p>
<p>
Such are the burdens of games journalists, the hardest-working people on Earth. I'm still on the fence, myself - perhaps I'll try to watch the full presentation in the bath. In the meantime, I invite further discussion as to whether Control was an action-RPG, and what Remedy emphasising the label for Control 2 suggests about its design.

They’re entirely premade and can feature cards you’ve yet to get. However, this unique mechanic is balanced out by some heavy limitations. Here’s what you need to know about how to unlock them and when to best use them.</p><h2 id="h24"><a id="unlock"></a>How to Unlock Rental Decks</h2><figure id="" data-id="4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-recommend-id="image://4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Deck tab for the Missions screen, with a Venusaur ex Rental Deck waiting to be claimed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Deck tab for the Missions screen, with a Venusaur ex Rental Deck waiting to be claimed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-recommend-id="image://4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Deck tab for the Missions screen, with a Venusaur ex Rental Deck waiting to be claimed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>The trick to unlocking Rental Decks is to acquire their highlight cards.</strong> This can be done by getting it out of a pack, through a Wonder Pick, or by crafting. Just as you can assign front-facing cards to represent your decks, every Rental Deck has one or two that represent the core of their game plan. These are the twelve currently available highlight cards and the basis for their subsequent decks:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Venusaur ex</li><li>Charizard ex</li><li>Blastoise ex</li><li>Pikachu ex</li><li>Mewtwo ex</li><li>Machamp ex</li><li>Nidoqueen &amp; Nidoking</li><li>Kanto Fossils (Aerodactyl, Kabutops, and Omastar)</li><li>Blaine</li><li>Lt. Surge</li><li>Brock</li><li>Koga</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a notification once you’ve pulled the necessary cards. Head over to the Mission screen and then onto the Deck tab to see the completed missions. Accept the reward to be granted with the related Rental Deck. They should be available to switch to next time you’re about to head into a Solo Battle. If you want to view what cards they have, you’ll need to click on the Decks button on any Battle screen. You cannot view them through the My Cards submenus.</p><h2 id="h25"><a id=""></a>Best Time to Use Rental Decks</h2><figure id="" data-id="8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-recommend-id="image://8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-recommend-id="image://8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rental Decks come with two limitations: They can only be used in Solo Battles and they have a limit of ten uses. That might leave you feeling unsure of what their purpose is. What’s the point if you can’t use them online and they’re not permanent options either?</p><p><strong>In my experience, Rental Decks are best used when you’re having trouble in Expert Solo Battles.</strong> These matches are the toughest challenges for those playing against the CPU. They’re even worse if luck hasn’t been on your side and you’re missing out on some key cards. With 25 Shop Tickets up for grabs from Battle Tasks and some decent first-time completion rewards like seven Pack Hourglasses and 200 Shinedust, it’s worth testing these different decks out.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Has A Staggering 12 Different Currencies, And Counting</a></span></p><p>Another potential use for Rental Decks is during Solo Events, such as the ongoing Lapras ex Drop Event. I haven’t had too much of an issue beating these even on the Expert level, but I’m lucky to have some decent Lightning-type cards. Those who aren’t as lucky can use the Lt. Surge Rental Deck to stand a chance and hopefully nab some cool promo cards. That being said, the Event Stamina isn’t wasted when you lose or concede in these battles. It’s arguably better to just keep trying with the cards you have.</p><p>Speaking of things being wasted, I do want to point out that Rental Decks do not function the same way Event Stamina does. <strong>These aren’t limited by wins but by your uses.</strong> If you lose a match or concede, you will go back to the Battle menu with one less use available. Make sure you’re 100% confident before you use one of these in a match.</p><hr><p>Anyone with a good eye has likely noticed that there is an Expansion button on the Deck Missions screen. It stands to reason that whatever expansion comes next to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> after Genetic Apex will also have its own premade sets. While the limited ten uses are a little disappointing, I do encourage people to use them. It can be a fun experience trying out new strategies and cards. Plus, even if pulling cards is entirely based on luck, eventually you could rebuild these rental decks on your own.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He also noted that the combat flowed smoothly from melee weapons like swords to magical attacks, not unlike the way Geralt fights in The Witcher 3.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is the follow-up to the highly successful RPG of the same name that was released in 2013. With the original being released over a decade ago, it's no surprise that it's still missing some modern features that we expect in games today. One of those features is cross-play, which has never been brought to the original Path of Exile. Fortunately, the developers at Grinding Gear Games have confirmed that Path of Exile 2 will feature cross-play support.</p><p>You can learn all about how the feature works and what you need to do to access it in the guide below.</p><h2>How cross-play support works in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Grinding Gear Games is going in the opposite direction in Path of Exile 2 compared to the original. The upcoming sequel will feature total cross-play support. This means you'll be able to play with any other player, regardless of the platforms you'll be playing on.</p><p>For example, if you're on PC and you want to play with someone on Xbox One, you can easily party up with them. The same works for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users and any other platform combination. Path of Exile 2 is being initially released on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. However, if future platforms are added to the mix, cross-platform support will likely include those platforms, as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401884"></a><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 launches in early access on December 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg"></figure><p>When you find a friend you want to play with, all you have to do is add them in Path of Exile 2 through their username. If the friend is on the same platform as you, they can join you through your system's friends list, in addition to the game's friends list. Once your friend is added, you can invite them to your party, or you can join theirs. <strong>Path of Exile 2 supports up to six players per party</strong>.</p><p>Cross-play support in Path of Exile 2 also means trading can be done across different platforms. So you don't have to worry about another player being on a different platform if you want to trade an item with them.</p><h2>Is there cross-save progression in Path of Exile 2?</h2><p>While cross-play support is terrific, what about cross-save support, also known as cross-progression? This is another feature that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed will be included in Path of Exile 2 during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-still-releasing-in-2024/1100-6527447/" data-ref-id="1100-6527447">early access launch</a>.</p><p>Cross-progression support means players can log into their Path of Exile 2 account on any platform and keep all of their saved data. For example, if you mainly play on PlayStation 5 but need to swap over to PC, you can do so without having to worry about losing your account's progress.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 is set to hit early access on December 6, but if you're looking for something to play sooner, check out our gallery of November's biggest games.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control/">Control 2</a>, the sequel to developer Remedy Entertainment's eerie game will be an action-RPG. This was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared</a> during Remedy's Capital Market day on November 19, alongside additional details to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control's</a> Mac support and an upcoming free update.</p><p>Action-RPG might conjure the image of a game like Diablo, but it doesn't sound as if Remedy is straying greatly from the formula of the first Control. In a statement to GameSpot, the developer expanded on the news: "Let people speculate, but suffice to say, Control 2 is a natural continuation to the first game, holding on to key tenets of storytelling and spectacle, but leaning even further into player agency, exploration and RPG mechanics."</p><p>Elsewhere in the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investor video</a>, Remedy said that the sequel is being made to appeal to a wider audience, but didn't elaborate exactly on what this means for the game. In addition, Control will receive a free update in early 2025, which will unlock "some previously released content."</p><p>The previously released content could refer to a few existing exclusive and paid DLC outfits--the Extradimensional Suit available through the AWE DLC, the Tactical Response outfit as a preorder reward, the Astral Dive Suit as a day-one bonus for PS4, and the Urban Response outfit as a goodie included in the Control Digital Deluxe edition for PS4.</p><p>Lastly, Control Ultimate Edition will be available on Mac on February 12, 2025. While the sequel doesn't have a release window, the multiplayer spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC Firebreak</a>, should ease the wait when it launches next year. If you want a closer teaser, there's a glimpse of the sequel in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2: The Lake House DLC</a>, which is an additional chapter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-expansion-is-both-an-epilogue-and-prologue/1100-6527270/" data-ref-id="1100-6527270">you shouldn't miss</a>.</p>

		<p>If there’s one thing we know and love Media Molecule for, it’s pushing creativity and experimentation within its game design. The studio burst onto the scene with PS3 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>, before taking the concept of in-game creation to new heights with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dreams">Dreams</a>, but nestled between those projects was something a little smaller, something that you could fit in your pocket. I am, of course, talking about the paper-folded platforming adventure of Tearaway.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tearaway - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0oxBviRGlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tearaway is certainly a more conventional game that the rest of what Media Molecule has made. Sure, LittleBigPlanet had its Mm created story and was a side-scrolling platformer, but those were an introduction to the potential that the level-creation tools could offer, and had the unique quirk of multiple planes. By contrast, Tearaway is a rather traditional 3D platformer.</p>


<p>But that meant that the team could go all-in with using the PS Vita’s additional features, perhaps most distinctively the rear touchpad. This was used for all sorts of gameplay mechanics, from piercing through the game world to move platforms and flick away enemies, to drumming on platforms to help Iota/Atoi jump higher to reach higher locations in the world. The touchscreen, meanwhile, is used for the game’s crafting where you can trace designs on pieces of paper that are then cut out, as well as place accessories on different characters.</p>


<p>The PS Vita’s camera has a central part to Tearaway too, as your face is in the game’s sun, basically turning you into the baby from Teletubbies. You are watching over the world at all times. The camera also brings parts of the world back to life where the Scraps, the enemies, have stripped all colour from different items and characters. Take a photo of them and you will bring back their features. Finally, the microphone lets you record little messages and sound effects, when prompted, to add your voice to Iota/Atoi’s world.</p>
<p>Sure, they’re all gimmicks, but they tie in with the overall charm and whimsy of the story that the game is telling, bringing you into the game and casting you as a You.</p>
<p>This part is as integral to Tearaway’s plot as Iota/Atoi’s journey in, because these characters are letters that are on a quest to deliver themselves to you. Not that they know that at first, and in fact are properly terrified when your face suddenly appears in the Sun so try to hide. It is only when they speak to other characters that they realise that you are an ally.</p>

<p>11 years on from its initial release. Tearaway’s level designs really hold up, as do the little side characters that act as guides and quest givers. The artistic vision of the development team took the main character from woods to labs, harbour towns to tears in reality. Each location is unique, and the way each location is fully made to look like it is made from paper really makes Tearaway stand out even now. The Scraps are fun designed enemies too, even if they do appear to be cardboard boxes with legs or wings. They are a danger to Iota/Atoi but they can be easily defeated with your help.</p>
<p>For me, Tearaway is also a window back to an era where Sony really let its developers explore fun and exciting ideas in its smaller games, while still investing well in its triple AAA space. The game space has changed in the last decade, and the Sony that released the PS Vita has become the Sony that’s had the success of the PS4 and PS5, the hits of Horizon, God of War and Spider-Man. There’s the odd PlayStation Studios game that stands out in this quirky manner, most recently Astro Bot, but it feels like we’re unlikely to see a new Tearaway game or a similarly offbeat effort any time soon, and that’s a real shame.</p>

I would love to see how the game we referenced would look with the HD-2D art style.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy VI</em> was the last <em>Final Fantasy </em>to appear on SNES and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695">considered by some to be the series peak</a></span>, with a sprawling cast of nuanced characters, a grand continent-hopping campaign, and meaty but traditional turn-based combat that sports a unique progression system based around ancient magical creatures collected throughout the journey. It represents the height of a timeless art style and the pinnacle of craftsmanship from the series’ early development team. </p><p>That’s part of why <em>Final Fantasy VI </em>seems like a better candidate for a retro-infused makeover rather than a full-scale Unreal Engine update in the style of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy. Plus, Kitase Yoshinori, <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>’s original director who now overseas the <em>FFVII </em>remakes, previously suggested doing the same thing to the SNES classic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1751840614952698239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1751840614952698239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would require a 20-year timeline</a></span> to rebuild the dense 16-bit RPG in modern terms. </p><p>That doesn’t mean that giving it the HD-2D treatment wouldn’t require several years of work. While some fans treat it like a simple filter that can be applied to the original game, Hayasaka explained to <em>Inverse</em> that the process of transforming <em>Dragon Quest III</em> required a lot of time, learning, and attention to detail. He pointed to how different the remake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFkbeCsEDrk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFkbeCsEDrk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first trailer in 2021</a></span> looked compared to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwFNq06bQk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwFNq06bQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent launch one</a></span>. </p><p>“Some say that because HD-2D is pixel-based and this game is a remake, it should be easier to produce, but that is far from the truth!” he said. “In my opinion, this style requires a higher level of artistic sensibility, and a remake faces more project-level limitations compared to a brand-new title, making the difficulty extremely high. After all, the expectations from the fans of the original game are a monumental hurdle we must work hard to meet.”</p><p>Ideally, the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake could serve as a training grounds of sorts for an HD-2D overhaul of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. With four years of experience on the project under the team’s belt, maybe the pieces are finally in place to make the long-standing fan dream become a reality.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-battlefield-6-is-undergoing-franchise%E2%80%99s-biggest-playtests-ever-to-prevent-another-disastrous-launch.1039680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield players have had a reasonably tough time with the franchise these past few years. 2018’s Battlefield V launch was a disaster, but 2021’s Battlefield 2042 was worse, pushing a lot of Battlefield fans away from the franchise. But now, with just a year until the next major installment in the Battlefield universe set to release, EA and DICE have a lot of making up to do. </p>



<p>Officially, EA has said all of the usual buzzwords you’d come to expect in its financial calls to promote the next game from “innovation” to “groundbreaking.” An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with IGN earlier this year</a> with head honcho Vince Zempella confirmed Insider Gaming’s past reports that the franchise was taking a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“back to its roots approach”</a> with 64 players, all-out destruction, and a modern setting. It all looks promising on paper, yet the scars of the past still burn today with its community, and fans of the franchise are still apprehensive about the future. Considering the franchise’s last two blunders, it’s understandable, but this time, EA and DICE seem to be all-in on ensuring it doesn’t happen a third time.</p>



<p>On a funding front, the next Battlefield has the most resources in the franchise’s history. Four studios are currently working on Battlefield: DICE, Motive, Criterion Games, and Ripple Effect. More importantly, EA and its studios seem more interested in gaining player feedback this time around. Of course, it’s not uncommon for games to have playtests during development. Almost every game has them at one point or another, but this time around, things are a lot different. </p>



<p>Sources say that playtests with external players are happening much more frequently than in past installments, and the amount of data and feedback collected is the most the franchise has seen in its history. From small feedback sessions to large-scale player tests, Battlefield is now taking the much-needed “player first” approach. It’s an approach that we’ll see continued to be played out coming to the start of the year, too, as it’s understood that EA and its studios have been eying up the return of the Battlefield Community Test Environment, but to what scale that’s incorporated at this time is unclear. </p>



<p>All in all, Battlefield seems to be trying to mend the mistakes it’s made, and with a return to a modern military shooter with destruction, four classes, and 64-player battles, EA could have a win on its hands. That being said, we’re still a year-ish from release and things can change, but so far at least, Battlefield could be back.</p>



<p>If you have any questions on the next Battlefield game, please <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/battlefield.26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a thread on the Insider Gaming forum</a>, and I’ll answer them throughout the next couple of days.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard had fans waiting a decade, and it seems so far <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the wait was worth it</a>, but the latest entry isn't a return to the franchise--it was a return to the Golden Age of BioWare. Along the way in its development, Dragon Age: The Veilguard originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">included multiplayer elements</a> until EA and BioWare changed course.</p><p>The massive decision for the overhaul was supported by EA and has seemed to have been the right call. Speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/corinne-busche-john-epler-game-directors-dragon-age/id1665581266?i=1000677429520" rel="nofollow ">My Perfect Console</a> podcast, The Veilguard directors Corinne Busche and John Epler described taking the game back to its roots and going against the stream with some gaming trends.</p><p>"I felt very supported through this by BioWare and EA," Busche said (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chasing-live-service-and-open-world-elements-diluted-biowares-focus-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says-discussing-studios-return-to-its-roots" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>).

from the studio.</p><p>"You know, I personally love Mass Effect Andromeda but there was also, we had open-world that was a big thing in the industry at the time and that starts to dilute your focus," Epler said. "We had Anthem-live-service dilutes your focus. So for us, it was really understanding what it is that people come to the studio to do--they work here for a reason, they want to make big stories that allow you to be a big hero of your own creation, but also a focus on characters, a focus on that experience of living in a different world."</p><p>When the decision was called for the change, Epler said he looked at the things that made the studio what it was known for: storytelling and epic single-player RPGs.</p><p>"For The Veilguard we just wanted to get back to those things that made the studio what it was, that contributed to what I would call the Golden Age of BioWare, when there was hit after hit being turned out," he added. "The Veilguard was a very conscious return to that with a focus on characters, storytelling and being just this really bombastic single-player RPG."</p><p>For more info on BioWare's latest fantasy RPG, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review-in-progress</a>.</p>

Due to launch on 21st November, Update 1.3 will deliver "a gargantuan number of improvements, fixes, and some entirely new features". These broadly consist of combat and balance overhauls together with changes for the Skirmish &amp; War Games modes, though they've shown the campaign a little love as well.

<p>
The devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025">announced that they would condense the game's launch roadmap</a> back in September, so update 1.3 is actually several updates rolled into one.</p>
<p>As regards the game's combat, Blackbird want to "increase the importance of strategic decision making", "make those decisions more intuitive and relevant to the outcome of battles", and "eliminate inconsistencies between how you'd expect units to react to orders and how they were actually behaving". 
</p><p>
To be specific, they've introduced a new armada-wide armour system that groups ships according to four tiers of damage mitigation - 10% for light armour, 20% for medium armour, 30% for heavy armour and 50% for mothership armour. This accompanies a new approach to directional damage: shots to the rear now have a 2.5X multiplier, but there's no longer a multiplier for damage to the side of a ship, "to better emphasize the advantage gained from clever positioning".
</p>
<p>
Other highlighted changes from <a href="https://www.homeworlduniverse.com/dev-update-unpacking-the-biggest-improvements-coming-to-update-1-3/">Blackbird's announcement post</a> include increasing the potency of strike craft. Calling upon community playtester feedback, they've shortened the distance strike craft fly before turning for another run on the target, beefed up bombers across the board, and made it harder for capital ships to shoot fighters and bombers down. The future is now, Hiigaran Torpedo Frigate captains!
</p>
<p>
With regard to controls, Blackbird have added a "reinforce targeted ship" ability to all ships. Command a ship to partner up with another using this ability, and it'll automatically adopt the formation, stance and current target of the ship being reinforced. You'll still need to manually add ships to control groups, however.
</p>
<p>
There's a new logic for target selection and prioritising. Give a group of ships a bandbox attack command, and they'll now "seamlessly split into smaller formations and spread fire more intelligently and evenly across the targeted units", prioritising ships they're more effective against. In other words, you can point ships at a mixed enemy fleet and let them figure out engagement tactics by themselves.
</p><p>
More diffuse changes include tweaking the retaliation range and "personality" of several ships so that they behave more consistently. Battle Cruisers and Destroyers, for example, used to be "a little too hyperactive", preferring to jockey for position at length rather than opening fire.
</p>
<p>
As for the changes to Skirmish mode, the update introduces the ability to hyperspace jump around the map, tweaks the resourcing system to encourage more strategic thought, especially early on in a match, and reworks the research element. "Now, Research functions like a classic tech tree, where ships and abilities are spread across branches that you gradually unlock piece by piece," the post explains. They've also expanded the AI difficulty settings with new bot "personae" such as "Sentinel" and "Swarm". Oh, and they've given Motherships fusion missiles, an endgame tech capable of blowing whole fleets away. Let's see those wily bomber pilots dodge that.
</p>
<p>
The roguelitey War Games mode now has 45 new artifacts, including "ultimate" artifacts that mitigate the negative effects of other artifacts. They've also "[injected] some much-desired variety into War Games missions with Interstitials" - aka randomly occurring mini-missions like bombing a certain number of targets against the clock - and revamped each War Games faction's tech tree.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, Blackbird have made changes to Homeworld 3's campaign based on player feedback. In particular, some missions will now let you linger on, repair your fleet and farm the map after achieving victory. Oh, and "a number of improvements have also been made to the Homeworld 3 mod tools, such as the ability to inject custom Unreal Blueprints and the inclusion of Homeworld 3's Campaign Blueprints". 
</p><p>
This "will be the last major content update for Homeworld 3," the devs conclude, though they add that publishers Gearbox "will be carefully monitoring incoming reports and will address any widespread critical issues that may arise in the wake of Update 1.3's launch". The game's multiplayer functionality and in-game mod browser will remain online for the foreseeable.
</p>
<p>
Homeworld 3 has been a severe disappointment for series enthusiasts and space simmers at large, with much criticism levelled at its controls and the underwhelming campaign. The above tweaks and additions don't strike me as a glorious rebirth - Steam reviews remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840080/Homeworld_3/#app_reviews_hash">mostly negative</a> at the time of writing - but they're clearly the result of much thought and toil.
</p>
<p>
 There's a closing note on the post which makes arch mention of "beginning a new chapter". What would you like them do next? I wouldn't say no to a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> follow-up.

<p>Pulling a Machoke is cool, as is landing everyone’s favorite Slowpoke; but opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket and getting the rarest cards is why we all play, and I’ve rounded up the absolute best cards Pokémon Pocket has to offer right now.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is the classic card card-collecting and player-battling hybrid that has been popular for 25 years, crammed into an easy-to-use phone app—unless you want to play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pokemon-tcg-pocket-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket on PC</a>. You open the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best packs</a>, assemble powerful decks, and face off with AI or human opponents.</p>



<p>While I enjoy the thrill of winning a battle, nothing beats the unbridled anticipation and eventual disappointment of opening a pack. My dreams of a Crown card usually dissipate instantly as I pull yet another Holographic Golduck. If you play Pokémon TCG Pocket enough, you’re bound to open tons of packs, so here are the best cards to look out for.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-rarest-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What are the Rarest Cards in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>Crown cards</strong> are easily the best of the best when it comes to Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p>



<p>These cards are very distinctive as they are completely gold, feature multiple swirling circles coming out to the edge of the design, and their rarity symbol is a gold-crown icon. </p>



<p>As of writing, Pokémon TCG Pocket only has <strong>three Crown cards</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Charizard</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Mewtwo</li>
</ul>



<p>Your chances of getting any of them are slim to none—and I think that’s being generous! If you check the “Offering Rates” in Pocket, the probability of getting one of these cards is <strong>0.040% in the fourth position of the pack</strong>. Your chances slightly increase with the <strong>fifth position which is valued at 0.160%</strong>.</p>

<p>The best cards to get in Pokémon TCG Pocket are <strong>Star Rarity cards</strong> as they offer the rarest and most intricately designed cards to pull from booster packs.</p>



<p>There are eight different types of Rarity in Pokémon TCG Pocket: </p>



<ul>
<li>One Diamond</li>



<li>Two Diamond</li>



<li>Three Diamond</li>



<li>Four Diamond</li>



<li>One Star</li>



<li>Two Star</li>



<li>Three Star</li>



<li>Crown</li>
</ul>



<p>One-Diamond cards are your usual array of Caterpies and Ponytas, whereas the bump-up to Star cards introduces Full Art and Full Art EX cards. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick list of every Star card in Pokémon TCG Pocket, and keep checking back with this list to reference.</p>

[...] It starts by Remedy creating a captivating creative pitch and game concept, which includes a budget ask," said Kallionpää.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Then we would have taken that out and sold it to a potential publisher. Once a publisher has bought the concept it is the publisher's responsibility to try and position [the title] and try to find a big enough audience for that game. Often publishers, especially if they are platform holders, have strategic platform interest, making them more willing to take risks on creative projects with unknown commercial upsides."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kallionpää explained that with its previous titles, especially projects funded by publishers, Remedy didn't prioritize building a game with a huge target audience in mind. Instead, the company was more focused on creating a compelling concept that would attract interest (and investment) from prospective partners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's going to change. Now that Remedy intends to fund development and self-publish its titles (with help from select partners like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/remedy-and-annapurna-enter-strategic-agreement-on-control-2-and-transmedia-push">Annapurna Pictures</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/remedy-enters-into-15-million-loan-agreement-with-tencent">Tencent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), Kallionpää said the company will need to be "more strategic" when thinking about that intended audience. He explained the studio will need to understand from the get-go whether a concept will be capable of attracting a large playerbase, because it's now Remedy's "sole responsibility" to ensure its projects become commercially viable.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Remedy expects entire organization to buy into new publishing model">Remedy expects entire organization to buy into new publishing model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kallionpää said Remedy's approach to self-publishing is shaped by three guiding principles. Firstly, the Finnish studio wants to build a "focused internal team" that owns the critical publishing areas and can achieve operational scale and global reach by working with key partners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secondly, he emphasized that Remedy will only publish its own games—largely because it wants "publishing to be closely integrated with our development teams throughout the life cycle of our games." Finally, he said everyone involved with production must understand "how we are publishing our games [and] how we are marketing out games," because all employees are driving towards the same end goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kallionpää noted that Remedy is still expanding its self-publishing team, which is split into six key units each with their own leader, and hopes to grow the division to just over 20 people. If the company can realize its vision, Kallionpää believes Remedy will deliver lucrative hits and nurture expansive player communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By publishing our games ourselves, we get to build closer integrations between game development and publishing to help align our games with a large enough target audience. We will also get closer closer to our players, as we are responsible for making the key decisions regarding updates and fixes based on player feedback and analytics," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And finally, self-publishing will push and motivate the whole organization to think more commercially, as we are solely responsible ourselves for the financial success or failure of our games."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

If you think this is something that will interest you, there is a trailer on YouTube that is just under two minutes long to showcase what you can expect from Corepunk. You can watch this video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corepunk: Official Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0L8Aj0u9CM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Corepunk comes with a lot of unique features, including expansive character customization, fog-of-war mechanics, and the ability to experience both PvE and PvP in a player-driven world. There are a variety of class options with in-depth skill trees that allow you to stand out from the crowd while you explore the cyber-fantasy world and engage with the storylines set out in front of you.</p>
<p>For those who are curious about the Early Access period of Corepunk, it will feature three full-voiced story episodes, which include a crafting and gathering system. You'll have six character classes to choose from and 15 world bosses to go up against. Of course, this is just the start of the game, and there will be plenty more added in the future. For those who pre-order the game, it will give access <a href="https://corepunk.com/en-us?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist%20PR%20List%20-%20Leading%20Gaming%20and%20Tech%20News%20(2023)&amp;utm_campaign=b8576b44ac-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_11_18_06_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-b8576b44ac-256552253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game launcher</a> and Early Access build.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Corepunk is in active development, with the Early Access period symbolizing the final stage of alpha testing, which is where the developers will be focused on making sure the game is optimized with bug fixing and polishes while also continuing to build on the content that is already released. Corepunk is set for a full launch by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>During the Early Access period of Corepunk, you'll get to explore three biomes, which will take you through the forest, swamps, and steppes, which all have their own unique challenges to face. In total, there are 350 quests that you can participate in during the Early Access period. A lot of these are side quests and are totally optional, allowing you to tweak the playstyle to your liking. As the Early Access period progresses, the developers plan on adding the Extraction Prison Island, PvE instances, and more heroes for players to choose from, allowing for a further unique experience.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Corepunk in Early Access? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Capital Markets Day dedicated to investors, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment has revealed new information on Control 2 and Alan Wake 2. As for the latter, we learned that it has sold 1.8 million units to date, which, however, isn't enough to fully <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recoup</a> all the development and marketing costs yet.</p>
<p>Control 2 is aiming far higher, with Remedy telling investors that sales of 3-4 million units would be required to fully recuperate a budget of €50 million (up from the €30 million spent on the first one) and go into profits. Part of the reason is that the sequel is being turned into an action RPG, whereas the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> an action adventure. Action RPG is a more marketable genre with a bigger audience. The first Control has sold 4.5 million units to date, while 19 million players have accessed the game in total (including, for example, Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscriptions).</p>
<p>Control 2 was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Back then, it looked like Remedy would repeat the successful partnership with 505 Games that gave birth to the previous installment. However, they completely <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> the plan earlier this year by acquiring the IP from 505 Games for €17 million. Two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Remedy had chosen a new partner, Annapurna Interactive; they would co-finance the game's development while leaving the IP in the hands of the Finnish studio and also work on live action adaptations for both Control and Alan Wake.</p>
<p>Before Control 2, Remedy will launch its cooperative multiplayer spin-off FBC <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, which is being made on a €30 million budget, won't cost full price, and will require three million units sold to be successful.</p>
<p>As a reminder, in addition to the multiple projects related to the so-called Remedy Connected Universe, the studio is also remaking its first two games, Max Payne 1 and 2, for Rockstar Games. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a>, the remake project entered full production three months ago.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-godzilla-hatsune-miku</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-gets-godzilla-and-hatsune-miku-dlc-next-week.1039566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-godzilla-hatsune-miku<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has revealed two new DLC characters for chaotic party platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>, and you couldn't hope to find two more contrasting pop culture icons.</p>

<p>Both characters are being added on November 26th, and they'll join the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>crew</a>,&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>'s Axel, and&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>'s Beat&nbsp;as downloadable, er, "monkeys" for the game.</p>

<p>First up, nuclear monster Godzilla is joining the&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>roster. Of course, this is a cutesy chibi-fied version of Godzilla rather than the fully-sized creature you might see in the likes of&nbsp;<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=S8Ei2Gqe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=4_YKO6l- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yep, that really is Godzilla himself in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from Godzilla's first video game appearance, and it's not even his first foray into the realms of DLC or update crossovers; he's also appeared in games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week" rel="nofollow">Dave the Diver</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-kong-and-godzilla-will-take-up-fight-in-world-of-warships" rel="nofollow"><em>World of Warships</em></a>, battling his old archnemesis King Kong in the latter.</p>

<p>Your second new DLC character for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is none other than Vocaloid star Hatsune Miku, who seems a little better-suited to the adorable world of&nbsp;<em>Monkey Ball</em>.</p>

<p>Much like Godzilla, Miku has also made appearances in other properties alongside starring in her own games; memorably, she was part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2024-brings-assassins-creed-and-hatsune-miku" rel="nofollow">major&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>First, here's the trailer for Godzilla, which shows off what he'll look like in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</p>




<p>Now that you've had your fill of kaiju antics, you can check out the altogether more anime-style trailer for Hatsune Miku.</p>




<p>Both of these characters will arrive alongside&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>'s 2.0 update, which brungs a number of new adventure challenges, battle stages, and modes. It's all launching on November 26th.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is available right now, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-repentance-plus-update-co-op</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-repentance-plus-update-co-op<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nicalis has released the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>Repentance+ update, finally bringing online co-op to the dungeon-crawling roguelike, as well as a host of other new stuff.</p>

<p>As noted in a Steam post announcing the update's launch, you're going to need all of the game's previous DLC in order to enjoy this update, and you're also going to need to be playing&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&nbsp;</em>rather than the original base game.</p>

<p>Assuming you tick all of those boxes, the Repentance+ update brings four-player online co-op to&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and it works across the game's Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier, and Challenge modes, as well as daily runs and seeded runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=3uTgmAGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=dfBgGw8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>now supports four-player co-op, assuming you're playing&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few differences to watch out for in online play. Bosses will drop items for all players, and if you join a run in progress, you'll be given items to catch you up "based on how far along the run is".</p>

<p>You can also spend coins at a revive machine to bring back dead players, but the cost will increase every time you do so, so make sure you consider carefully whether or not it's worth bringing back your friends.</p>

<p>Mods will be disabled online, and you also won't be able to unlock achievements in online play if you join mid-run (although joining at the very start of a run will be fine).</p>

<p>Pay no mind to the "beta" tag attached to this update; Nicalis says it's a "full-featured release", but that the beta tag has been attached because the studio is "still looking to refine things and squash any remaining bugs".</p>




<p>As well as online co-op, this update also brings a veritable treasure trove of item buffs and reworks for solo players, as well as a number of fixes that should make your&nbsp;<em>Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>experience a bit smoother. You can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/7119722540407193807" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a> if you want to.</p>

<p>The Repentance+ update is available right now, but you'll need all of the game's previous DLC to run it. That includes&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, as well as its&nbsp;<em>Afterbirth&nbsp;</em>DLC and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-repentance-update-is-its-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">original Repentance update</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> launches on Steam and the Microsoft Store today. Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">stinking rat hordes</a> - it builds upon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020">the 2020 game</a> by "[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming", in the words of the launch announcement release</p>
<p>We've got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of "machine learning" technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-and-zenimax-union-reach-first-of-its-kind-agreement-over-usage-of-ai-tools-in-gamedev">the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off</a>. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it'll devour as you play.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 shares many of its moving parts with the 2020 game, which made use of tech from Blackshark.ai, Microsoft's Azure tools and Bing Maps to analyse satellite and aerial imagery and generate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-341-photorealistic-cities-in-microsoft-flight-simulator-2020">terrain maps and objects such as buildings</a>. While a lot of this is delivered by the initial download, some of it is streamed to you on demand. 
</p>
<p>
The major change with MFS 2024 is that it streams a lot more, while simultaneously trying to offer a lot more visual opulence. "We did surveys and asked people, how can we do this - what can we improve?" MFS head Jorg Neumann told me in an interview earlier this month. "And one of the areas that was very consistent was well, it would be nice if the ground would look a little bit better. Because in MFS 2020 we had the whole world and it looked good from a certain altitude, but once you landed, it didn't look super-detailed."

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwI5VZo-wNc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
MFS 2024 tries to address this by way of a new online machine learning platform that generates terrain detail on demand, based on rules given by the developers. "So we looked at the textures, basically, and the way it works is we had a team that marked up 28,000 tiles," Neumann explained. "So we picked some tiles that were representative of Earth - some of them were forest, some of them were desert, some of them were rivers, those types of things, and then we mark them up and say, 'this is gravel, this is low grass, this is bush'. 
</p><p>
"And then you feed that into a machine learning system, and you say 'this type of colour and this type of pattern is this' - you feed it in, and you get everything back, you look at the results, and then you have human intervention again. You basically say: 'Oh OK, got this wrong.' And then you retrain it. We did that in four different stages."</p>
<p>What does that process of human intervention look like in practice, I asked? What's the trick to avoiding the kind of uncanny distortion we often see in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-understand-the-future-of-generative-ai-we-need-better-language-to-describe-it">today's prompt-based generated art</a>, to say nothing of the previous game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-perfectly-normal-abyss-has-appeared-in-microsoft-flight-sim">cosmically horrible terrain deformations</a>?
</p>
<p>
"It's just picture analysis, really," Neumann said. "It's just a lookup table and you say, is this sand? We defined, I think, 26 different surface types - red sand or brown sand to asphalts, those types of things. And I don't know about distortion but you know, you basically say, 'oh this one is this, and this one is this', and it got some stuff wrong sometimes, you know - it understood gravel to be sand. And then you have to retrain it a little bit." 
</p>
<p>
Once generated in response to one player's movements, MFS 2024's terrain data is then available to other pilots - it's streamed into their games when they're close by. This makes the system more efficient, and gives rise to the peculiar thought that when you fly over a remote area in the game you are bringing that location to life for everybody else.
</p><p>
One inevitable fear I had, on hearing about this system, is whether the expanded role of machine learning has come at the cost of jobs. While it varies by the tool, discipline and company, there's a link between today's AI tools and corporate cost-cutting, with larger video game publishers such as Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">dismissing tens of thousands of people</a> even as they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">spend billions</a> on software that theoretically automates aspects of game development, such as the creation of art assets for buildings and vehicles.
</p>
<p>
According to Neumann, however, MFS 2024's expanded usage of machine learning has had "no impact" on the workforce. "The only thing we've done is grow," he went on. "Flight Simulator 2020, it was a team of 100. Flight Simulator 2024 is 200 people at Asobo, a total of 800 people [at supporting studios]." It would not have been possible to mark up the game's map for the generator 'by hand', Neumann insisted. "We would have spent our entire lives and then some just marking up terrain, which is not really the core of the thing. So it's just a tool that helps us."
</p>
<p>
The more immediate concern is that the reliance on streaming will require the beefiest of broadband connections. A few months ago, there was a <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101112/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-up-to-81gb-of-downloads-per-hour-play-the-game/index.html">report</a> that MFS 2024 would require you to stream as much as 81GB an hour. Neumann told me that this was a calculation based on an unoptimised build running on the most demanding settings, and that the average data use would be "way, way less than that" - not least because most players will spend the bulk of their time high up, coasting through already-loaded "aerial data" that doesn't have to be streamed. Asked to give a rough average figure for a player's data use, he suggested a relatively modest 5GB an hour.
</p>
<p>
While 5GB an hour is still quite a chunk, Neumann feels the expanded streaming system is more efficient from the player's perspective, because it means the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-flight-simulators-latest-patch-halves-the-games-download-size">initial download</a> can be a lot smaller - around 50GB. It also means you won't have to download massive expansions over the next few years - instead, the game's representation of Earth can be overhauled and expanded remotely, with the new bits being streamed to each player as required. 
</p><p>
"Flight Simulator 2020 was around 120 gig, and then we added all these world updates, and each world update hovers between 10 gigs and 30 gigs, so we're now at hundreds of gigs," he said. "And we're going to keep going. So just imagine world update 38 in 2028, or something. A terabyte download - it just doesn't scale."
</p>
<p>
In practice, Nuemann noted, many MFS 2020 players didn't feel inclined to visit the vast majority of its simulated Earth. "An airport is two gigabytes, and we have a ton of airports, right," he said. "Under the old scheme, you had to download every airport, even though you had no intention of ever visiting this place. I know a lot of people that just fly from their local hometown to where they grew up in college. And they don't want to explore the entire planet. They just want to hang out in the area that they know. 
</p>
<p>
"Their data consumption [in MFS 2024] is going to be tiny. So we actually think we've saved a bunch, and that's actually much better. The brute force huge client thing - I don't think this really scales. Just imagine if our texture resolution goes up again."
</p>
<p>
While Neumann's arguments about efficiency sound reasonable to me in the abstract, it's obviously unclear right now how players will play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and how they might use or abuse its dependence on streaming generated terrain. One, more whimsical scenario that occurs to me is that disreputable pilots might decide to troll the developers by carrying out low-altitude flights en masse, increasing the burdens on the machine learning and streaming systems. 
</p><p>
That open-endedness is worrisome because generative AI at large has a mounting energy and emissions cost, and Microsoft especially are trying to walk the line between adhering to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">relatively ambitious carbon negative plans</a> while also plunging inordinate sums into technologies such as OpenAI's various roided-up chatbots and Microsoft's flagship Copilot app.</p>
<p>The most prominent generative AI tools soak up <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243">a lot of power</a>, both in the course of "training" them on datasets with human oversight, and when actually running them on data centres. For all their rhetoric, Microsoft's greenhouse gas emissions were actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157496/microsoft-ai-carbon-footprint-greenhouse-gas-emissions-grow-climate-pledge">30 per cent higher in fiscal year 2023</a> than the previous year.

While Neumann didn't share any estimates about overall energy usage in our chat, I doubt that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's new machine learning and streaming systems will have an emissions footprint on par with, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-adding-a-dedicated-ai-button-to-windows-keyboards-as-they-call-2024-the-year-of-the-ai-pc">giving your keyboard a Copilot button</a>. But it's all part of the picture. Look out for more on the subject in a piece later this month, in which Neumann and I discuss the philosophy of flight simulation, future community-driven features, and the sheer weirdness of generating an entire planet in real time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
