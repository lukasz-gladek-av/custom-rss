			<p>Roleplaying games have been on an incredible winning streak lately. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">2024 was a monumental year thanks to the release of some very high-quality games</strong></a>, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/"><strong>2025 has managed to keep that momentum going</strong></a>, proving that we are living in a golden age for RPGs. From long-awaited sequels that finally delivered on a decade of hype to new IPs that left their mark on the genre with involving narratives and engaging gameplay, this year was another filled with quality releases.</p>



<p>Because of this rich release line-up, narrowing this list down to just five games was more difficult than ever. Whether it was the revival of a cult classic, the perfection of a tactical formula, or a sprawling open world that actually felt lived-in, the RPGs of 2025 will be remembered for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">9.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is undoubtedly one of the best role-playing games released in the current console generation</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out of nowhere. Developed by Sandfall Interactive, an unproven game development studio based in France, the game blew RPG enjoyers all over the world out of the water with its modernization of the classic turn-based JRPG formula.</p>



<p>Featuring one of the best stories and characters in years, a challenging combat system incorporating action game elements for enhanced interactivity, and a soundtrack that makes every sequence memorable,  Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 quickly became a smashing success, its high quality recognized by the entire industry with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/"><strong>Game of the Year award</strong></a> at this year's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>All the praise the game received is absolutely deserved, as I noted in my review: <em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II improves the foundation set by the first entry in the series in every possible way</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite being a little rough around the edges, the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance quickly became the open-world RPG to play for those looking to live a medieval life in a living, breathing digital world. Topping this was a difficult task, but Warhorse Studios not only met expectations but also exceeded them with Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p>



<p>The continuation of Henry of Skalitz's story not only impresses with the refinement of many of the mechanics seen in the original, or with the sheer size of the new 15th-century Bohemia map (almost double that of the first game), but with its density. The game is chock-full of little events, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-talks-about-dynamic-npc-routines-and-emergent-storytelling-for-side-quests/"><strong>NPCs' reactions</strong></a>, discoveries, and easter eggs, making it easy to lose oneself in what, to date, is the most lively open-world seen in role-playing games.</p>



<p>In his review of the game, Chris Wray could only praises such an excellent RPG:<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-9">Elden Ring Nightreign (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">9</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is a great example of how to adapt an established formula into something both new and engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the immense success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>, there was little doubt that the open-world game would become the first entry in a series, much like the original Dark Souls. While a sequel has yet to be announced, the franchise was expanded in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>a rather unexpected way with Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></a>.</p>



<p>On paper, FromSoftware's new foray into a multiplayer-focused experience does not sound particularly compelling, as a shrinking playable zone and resetting character progression seem to be completely antithetical to the Souls series formula. However, this combination of high-speed gameplay, co-op, and roguelite mechanics comes together extremely well, making the game a showcase of how to leverage an established experience to offer something different.</p>



<p>I wasn't really convinced about the game before release, but after playing, I was hopelessly hooked, as I wrote in my review: <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-8-8">Avowed (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Avowed-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Avowed stands as a great role-playing game enhanced by what Obsidian Entertainment does best</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/"><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></a> series, its world of Eora was expanded with Avowed, a first-person role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment to a high standard.</p>



<p>Set in a remote corner of the world to make the experience welcoming for newcomers, Avowed's strength lies in its narrative elements, rooted in the great writing the studio is known for. Gameplay still delivers with <a href="https://wccftech.com/extended-avowed-gameplay/"><strong>solid combat and progression system</strong></a>, but lacks the same vibrancy of other open-world RPGs like The Elder Scrolls series, whose fifth entry Skyrim served as originally inspiration for the game, before its scope was toned down.</p>



<p>All of these elements come together well, making for a marked step forward from The Outer Worlds, as Alessio Palumbo noted in his review: <em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-9-5">Monster Hunter Wilds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">9.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Key-Art-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series formula meaningfully with an open-world setting and new combat mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong>Monster Hunter World</strong></a>, expectations were high for Monster Hunter Wilds, especially for those who preferred World's approach to the series' gameplay over the much more action-oriented approach of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Although the community feels that these expectations were not met at launch, it's undeniable that Monster Hunter Wilds does most of what it sets out to do well. The open-world setting streamlines some of the series staples without dumbing them down, while the addition of Focus Mode helps hunters target certain monster body parts with every weapon type and makes hunts against some of the best-designed monsters in the series more spectacular than ever with the addition of a Wounds system.</p>



<p>With most of the launch complaints addressed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/"><strong>post-launch updates</strong></a>, Monster Hunter Wilds is now in a better state than at launch, and is now even more worthy of experiencing, as I highlighted in my review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2’s first year did come with a new <em>Zelda</em> game, though it’s not necessarily the one diehard fans are waiting for. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> ties directly into the storyline of <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, but it’s a musou-style hack-and-slash game rather than a traditional <em>Legend of Zelda</em> adventure. Still, the franchise’s producer says some of that action flavor could influence the direction of the next mainline entry.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-switch-2-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-reviews-metacritic-2000641055"><em>Age of Imprisonment</em></a> was a collaboration between Koei Tecmo’s AAA Games Studio and the <em>Zelda</em> team at Nintendo, including long-time producer Eiji Aonuma. While AAA Games Studio would lead on designing features and gameplay, the<em> Zelda</em> team would test and give feedback.&nbsp;“We aimed to combine these two approaches; the<em> Zelda</em>-like, strategic back-and-forth of using Zonai gear and varied techniques against powerful foes with the exhilaration of&nbsp;<em>musou&nbsp;</em>(i.e. feeling mighty powerful as you cut down waves of weaker foes),” AAA Games Studio head Yusuke Hayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eiji-aonuma-hints-that-next-zelda-game-will-be-inspired-by-elements-of-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">translated by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p>

 <p>When Nintendo would raise concerns about something, the Koei Tecmo team would come back with “proposals that elevated it into something even better,” <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi said. “The inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the (next)<em> Zelda</em> we create,” Aonuma added. “Please picture this while playing <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, and look forward to our <em>Zelda</em>.”</p>

 <p>Is this laying the groundwork for a <em>Devil May Cry</em>-like evolution of the franchise, or is it just Aonuma being cheeky? He noted elsewhere in the interview that his team was hoping to be the first to release a <em>Zelda</em> game for Nintendo’s new hardware but were beaten to it by Koei Tecmo. “<em>The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment</em> is the first <em>Zelda</em> title released for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to bring out the ‘first’ (<em>Zelda</em> game on the new console),” he reportedly chuckled.</p>

 <p>In his mind, at least, it’s clear<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> is a true<em> Zelda</em> game and not just another <em>Warriors</em> spin-off. From a story point of view, it’s understandable why. Anyone wanting to get the full picture of the events from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> would need to have experienced it and the previous <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&nbsp;</em>as well. Will the next<em> Zelda</em> game return to that world, or break the mold and start off someplace new in the <em>Zelda</em> timeline? <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> didn’t get any DLC so hopefully that means we’ll find out the answer sooner than expected.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/">The Indie Game Awards</a>, a usually delightful and low-controversy annual celebration of the best of indie games in a given year, has found itself having to retract three different awards handed out in last week’s event, including its Game of the Year prize. That originally went to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, which also won Best Debut Indie, both already controversial choices given <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">the game is not “indie” by pretty much every understanding of the term</a>, but was withdrawn on the allegation that the developers, Sandfall Interactive, were not honest about the game’s use of AI when it was submitted. The other retraction is for an Indie Vanguard recognition of a Game Boy-like game that is only available on weapons dealer Palmer Luckey’s ModRetro devices.</p> <p>A big part of the IGAs, organized by Six One Indie, are its progressive values and its desire to support the indie scene in a positive way, making its intentions and selections potentially different from those of other award ceremonies out there. One of those values is to not endorse games made using so-called “generative AI” tools. In a video posted to BlueSky over the weekend, Six One’s Mike Towndrow stated that Sandfall told the IGAs that no gen-AI had been used in the creation of <em>Clair Obscur</em>, only admitting that in fact it had been on the day of the awards. (We have reached out to Sandfall and owners Kepler to ask for their side of events.)</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti/app.bsky.feed.post/3magufzccy22i" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigwdw5iwm2iojwzodusm5l6taqldvuqpnuyrc2miidgks6zhwflz4"> <p lang="en">The IGAs Nomination Committee is officially retracting Debut Game and Game of the Year, awarding both categories to new recipients. Additionally, we are retracting one of the Indie Vanguard recipients.</p> <p>Full details can be found in our FAQ under Game Eligibility: www.indiegameawards.gg/faq</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti?ref_src=embed">The Indie Game Awards (@indiegameawards.gg)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti/post/3magufzccy22i?ref_src=embed">2025-12-20T18:45:10.232Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>In a statement posted to the IGA’s FAQ, the point is reiterated.</p> <blockquote><p><span>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> from its nomination. While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place. As a result, the IGAs nomination committee has agreed to officially retract both the Debut Game and Game of the Year awards.</span></p></blockquote> <p>As a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> has been given the Game of the Year award, while Debut Game goes to à la mode games’ <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796580/Sorry_Were_Closed/">Sorry We’re Closed</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>The other rescinded award is one of the IGA’s Indie Vanguard selections, <a href="https://gortyncode.itch.io/">Gortyn Code</a>,<span>&nbsp;a Greek indie developer which made a Game Boy game called&nbsp;<em>Chantey</em>. However, since the announcement, the IGA team learned that the game’s physical card is only being produced and sold by ModRetro, a retro gaming company owned by Oculus-founding billionaire Palmer Luckey, who also runs the arms-dealing Anduril Industries. And to make sure there was no ambiguity left, <a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868">it announced the Anduril Chromatic</a>, a retro gaming device made from the same metal used to build the company’s military drones.</span></p>

 <p>In the IGA’s FAQ it’s stated, “<span>The IGAs nomination committee were unfortunately made aware of ModRetro’s nature and principles the day after the 2025 premiere with the news of their upcoming handheld console. As the company strictly goes against the values of the IGAs. [sic] Due to the ties with ModRetro, Indie Vanguard has also been retracted as we do not want to provide the company with a platform.”</span></p>

 <p>However, it goes on to add that “<span>the decision does not reflect Gortyn Code, but ModRetro alone. Chantey remains a wonderful throwback to the Game Boy era,” encouraging people to seek out the game via its <a href="https://gortyncode.itch.io/">Itch.io page</a>, where it can be played.</span></p>

 <p>Some might argue they would prefer their award organizers not allow ideological positions to determine their criteria, and those people will be able to take comfort in the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">this is the case</a> for almost every other ceremony out there, while recognizing that the IGAs are independently owned and run by Six One Indie, which can do whatever it pleases. You can watch all the original announcements for the IGAs in the video below, for which replacement acceptance speeches will be recorded by the new winners.</p>

<p>Listen up, extraction fans. Battlestate Games has just announced the commencement of a new Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops event, set to run from today, December 22, to January 4. The action kicks off today at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST, and it’s set to award viewers with all kinds of in-game items.</p>



<p>In a blog post, the team at Battlestate Games confirmed that in-game items and unlockable containers are <strong>guaranteed </strong>to be secured by <strong>all </strong>viewers watching <strong>any </strong>Tarkov streamer.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-tarkov-drops-event-end">When Does The Tarkov Drops Event End?</h2>



<p>You’ll have plenty of time over the festive window and into the new year to unlock the latest round of rewards in Escape from Tarkov. The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">all-new blog post</a> confirmed that the event <strong>ends </strong>at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST on January 4.</p>



<p>Here’s the need-to-know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Drops will be activated on the channels of ALL Twitch streamers without exception who will be broadcasting in the Escape from Tarkov category.</p>



<p>Drops – in-game items</p>



<p>During the campaign, at certain intervals, you will be guaranteed to receive an unlockable container, which are categorized by the rarity of the contents – Common, Rare and Epic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s more important is that this Drops event is accessible to <strong>all players</strong>, even those on the PvE platform. This has been a point of contention in recent months, with users exclusive to the PvE mode feeling ‘cheated’ by PvP players getting more bang for their buck.</p>



<p>But the developers at Battlestate Games have stressed that they’ll be ‘doing more’ for PvE players moving forward, especially as they make up a fair portion of the game’s player base.</p>



<p>Here are the rules for the Twitch Drops campaign:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Drops can be earned by users who have an active copy of the game</li>



<li>To receive or enable Drops, both the viewer and the streamer need to attach their Twitch account to their game profile on the project’s website. You can do this&nbsp;<a href="https://profile.tarkov.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></li>



<li>You can watch one or more broadcasts, but viewing time for rewards will only count if those broadcasts are participating in the event</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>2025 brought us Switch 2, of course, but it's been a very strong year across the board, with exceptional games of all sizes on all platforms - and an absolute <em>ton</em> of them. Perhaps the knock-on effects of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">layoffs</a> taking out huge swathes of the industry haven't quite hit the pipeline, but this year we've once again had more brilliant games than time to play them all.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The future may be uncertain, but the breadth of quality on Switch 1 and 2 this year is undeniable, so let's take a moment to celebrate that. We've got 25 games below, <strong>in alphabetical order</strong>, with comments from the pickees (yep, making it a word), plus a chunky list of honourable mentions to finish.</p>
<p>Let us know your personal favourites in the usual place, and <strong>keep an eye out for our reader-ranked top 50 very soon</strong>.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Quite a few roguelikes have sucked me into their ‘one more run’ trappings this year, but none have held me in a chokehold like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. After bouncing off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, it was Absolum’s simplicity that first pulled me in — its beat-‘em-up controls and Saturday-morning-cartoon visuals making the whole thing feel very un-busy in a way that completely worked for me.</p>
<p>That simplicity hides a wonderful depth beneath, and I was soon crafting builds specifically designed with an end goal in mind. The thing that kept me coming back for more, however, was how the game sells that fantasy of “next time, I’ll do better”. Every run feels like a step in the right direction, every upgrade feels like a game-changer, and, to top it all off, there’s a frog…who’s a wizard. Come on, what’s not to like? - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+ (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>'90s TV sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo</a> would fall apart if just one aspect wasn't <em>perfectly</em> realised. From the technical side, something as notionally simple as CRT static or signal distortion can be difficult to get right, but it's just one tick on a long checklist that the devs absolutely nail.</p>
<p>The interstitial graphics and links are <em>spot-on</em>. The editing, phenomenal. The writing, wonderfully subtle. The set design, transportative. The camera work, impeccable. Performances, inspired. Audio, fantastic. [<em>Feature here</em>], [<em>Strong adjective here</em>]. And it all comes together in this perfect time capsule of late 20th-century TV broadcasting.</p>
<p>Don't, whatever you do, go into it expecting a game, but this is one of the most ambitious projects to come out this year on Switch or anywhere else. - <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>A late-releasing entry, Wombat Brawler's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is a game about taking it slow, casting a line, and fishing some fish. The pixel art is quite possibly the best in any game I've played, and the loop, although simple, manages to keep you engaged with its many baits, rods, and fish to be caught.</p>
<p>If you need something after a long and stressful day, this is the right game for you. - <em>FS</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I headed into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> with very little idea of what to expect. I like TTRPGs and all things sci-fi, but I hadn’t played the first game, and everything looked a bit…texty. After making my first few decisions, picking up crewmates, risking their lives, and having rather stern words with those back on a nearby space station, I knew that this would end up sitting high on my GOTY list.</p>
<p>The music is phenomenal, the storytelling is sublime, and the characters — the characters! — well, I haven’t felt this protective over a bunch of NPCs in years. I achieved the exact ending I hoped for for my Sleeper, the one I worked so hard to put into place, and I was still an emotional wreck as the credits rolled. A stunning game, through and through. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><del>Cyberpunk is the best game what the hell is wrong with the rest of you?</del></p>
<p>There’s nothing quite like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2. It’s gritty, it’s dirty, it’s shiny, it’s clean, it’s a living, breathing world that casts a very unflattering reflection of our own. It’s got a belting cast of characters, intense action sequences, and some real heartache. Just be warned, if you’re hoping for a happy ending: wrong city, wrong people. - <em>AO</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>After previewing, reviewing, and building a guide campaign for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I have put over 100 hours into this 25-hour platforming adventure. And do you know what? I’d do it all over again. I struggle to think of another 2025 game that <em>feels</em> this good, or that has put this big a smile on my face. DK, you Rool. - <em>JN</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If anyone asks you why they should consider getting a Switch 2 right now, this exclusive is probably <em>the</em> main reason. It’s the exact kind of platforming experience you want to see showcasing new Nintendo hardware. I’m even happy to overlook the slight performance issues during certain boss encounters, as DK's latest outing is a smashing good time from start to finish. - <em>LD</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It’s hard to play Bananza without a massive grin on your face. It’s colourful, dynamic, open, and comes coupled with some absolutely banging tracks to enjoy as you blast through the endless swathes of destructible environments. - <em>AO</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Weirdly, every time I go back to DKB (the final boss was tricky, so I returned to previous layers to find more ooo-bananas), I've liked it a <em>little</em> less. But it made such an impact in July that it still makes my top five with its boundless beans and boldness. It channels the quality you'd expect from the Odyssey team into something pleasingly, almost wrecklessly different. - <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Despite releasing way back in January, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia</a> has been ever-present in my mind – even in a year stuffed full of fantastic Metroidvanias. Taking everything good about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> and fine-tuning it, including better combat, fantastic traversal skills, excellent bosses, and a refined skill system, makes for a near-perfect experience in my mind.</p>
<p>Tonally, as well, Ender Magnolia has its own identity, a level of melancholia blended with dark steampunk. The characters help bring a little levity to the adventure. But this is a world I could gladly wallow (or delight) in for a long time. Whatever Adglobe and Live Wire do next, I’ll be there. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I never played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, but the buzz surrounding Level-5’s long-awaited sequel could not escape me. And my goodness, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> had a <em>grip</em> on me. Outside of an MMORPG, I don’t think I’ve ever played a game so stuffed full of content that also feels completely coherent. A game that should be completely overwhelming, yet is so relaxed and easy to digest.</p>
<p>Level-5’s return over these past two years has been a joy to watch, and I’m so glad we’re seeing more from the team. I still occasionally dip into Ginomorsia for a few minutes just to run around, level up some lives, and live a carefree life doing stuff. It’s just a great escape, one that I‘m excited to lose more time to when the DLC comes. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Come on, this is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, the greatest SRPG ever made. I still feel this way after playing The Ivalice Chronicles, which elevates an all-timer thanks to some incredible voice acting. Joe Pitts and Gregg Lowe deserve all of the accolades for bringing humanity and depth to Ramza and Delita. The gameplay tweaks also help smooth out some of the rougher edges. Basically, this is a must-play, in my eyes. - <em>AH</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My favourite Final Fantasy? Indeed it is, and in this Ivalice Chronicles edition, it sings like never before. I have no issue with the missing War of the Lions content in all honesty, having personally preferred the remixed narrative here, and they also tweaked and polished, and added vital stuff like new difficulty levels, whilst nailing the graphical enhancements. A stunner! - <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t think Supergiant Games could bring anything new to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> formula, but now I’ve played over 100 hours of this, I can tell you, I was <em>very</em> wrong. The gameplay variety here is astounding: each of the six weapons feels unique, with every aspect requiring a completely different build. I’m also a big fan of some of the new boons, especially Apollo and Hera who I’m always begging to get on every run.</p>
<p>I have some qualms with the story, and the various currencies may be a bit much, but it hasn’t dulled my love for Supergiant's output. I’ll buy everything they release, because they know how to make an exceptional game. Hades II is no exception. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>My hype levels were high for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> (like, real high), and, miraculously, Team Cherry managed to live up to them. I am, historically, very bad with Soulslike mechanics, but finally beating that High Halls gauntlet after throwing multiple hours at it, oof, there’s no feeling quite like it! - <em>JN</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have a lot to say about Silksong, so I’ll say it elsewhere - look out for a feature! But my worries about this sequel not living up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> were unfounded; I’m <em>desperate</em> to play it again. And again. It makes me sad I’ll never get to experience my first steps into the Citadel or finally defeating the true final boss again. - <em>AH</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As far as Metroidvanias go, this is so up at the top of the list it’s hard to see it from all the way down here. It’s <em>brutally</em> difficult, and absolutely not one for those who can’t handle unfiltered rage, but there are few games more satisfying. - <em>AO</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>As a diehard Musou fan, I am always ready to jump in and defend the genre against its many naysayers. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, I genuinely, for the first time, don't even feel the need to bother. You can say what you want, mate. This is deep, addictive, and wonderfully fun action fare that looks and performs a doozy on Switch 2.</p>
<p>They've been close with a few entries in the past, but this is the first Warriors game where Switch performance, alongside combat enhancements and, lest we forget, that official nod from Nintendo on the lore front, all marry to make for something I'd unreservedly recommend to any action game fan. - <em>PJ</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I really wanted to get into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> when it was released on Switch 1, but I wasn’t sold on the game's performance. Fortunately, Age of Imprisonment does a much better job in this department (bumping the action up to 60fps, for the most part), and in terms of the gameplay, it’s one of Koei Tecmo’s best Musous to date. - <em>LD</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I’ve always been a fan of Llamasoft, so it really shouldn’t come as a surprise that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a> resonated so much. While technically a remake of the 1984 original from Dave Theurer, Jeff Minter’s latest creation is a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>Blending deceptively simple gameplay with mind-melting psychedelic visuals, it's a joy to behold, and a game that simply begs to be replayed as you strive for the global leaderboards. I hesitate to use the phrase “there’s nothing else quite like it,” but screw it: There’s nothing else quite like it. <em>- OR</em></p>

			<p>In many ways, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was a game decades ahead of its time. Originally released in 2001, the title remained misunderstood for years, largely due to its controversial protagonist switch and a narrative that seemed to mirror its own predecessor excessively.</p>



<p>However, over the years, players have reevaluated the game as a chilling prophecy. Hideo Kojima appeared to predict a world where social media, information overload, and AI-driven control would reshape the fabric of society. Yet, according to the creator himself, this wasn't an act of prediction, but a warning.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA"><strong>In a new interview with Wired</strong></a>, Hideo Kojima was asked about AI gaining more control in the real world, just as seen in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and if he predicted that this era would come. <em>'Metal Gear Solid 2 is about digital society. In digital society, everything is preserved. It wasn't about AI, but interweaving digital data gaining a will of its own. When everyone is connected and exchanging opinions instantly, how does life change?"</em> Kojima-san explained.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I didn't predict it, but rather a future I didn't desire,"</em> the legendary game creator concluded with a sobering thought.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Despite his modesty, many remain unconvinced that Kojima doesn't possess a certain "prophetic" edge. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding</strong></a>, for instance, famously launched just months before the COVID-19 pandemic turned its themes of isolation and "hero couriers" into a global reality, themes that were further expanded in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</strong></a></p>



<p>As Kojima moves forward with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/if-you-watch-the-od-trailer-many-times-theres-a-hint-says-kojima-we-built-new-medium/"><strong>experimental horror project OD</strong></a> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/">so experimental Kojima-san doesn't know if it will work</a></strong>) and his return to "Espionage Action" with Physint (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">which is still very early in development</strong></a>), we have to wonder: which part of our future is he warning us about now? Are you excited, or perhaps a little terrified, to see what he anticipates next? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holiday shopping season is in full swing, but time is running out to get your gifts delivered on time. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday are traditionally the best times to score deals, you can still find excellent discounts now—<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6546/">like on the JBL Grip portable Bluetooth speaker, which is currently available at a 21% discount on Amazon</a>. Normally priced at $100, you can grab it for just $79, making it an ideal gift option this season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Sound in a Compact Speaker</h2>
<p>The JBL Grip delivers top-notch sound. It has a sound boost algorithm that analyzes the music in real time, optimizing its output for even bigger sound without distortion.</p>
<p>Crafted for portability, the JBL Grip is designed to travel with you. Its IP67 rating means it’s both waterproof and dustproof, so you can take it anywhere—even to the beach, pool, or through rainy conditions—without worrying about damage. The speaker’s tough, fabric-covered exterior adds durability, while the rubber casing helps protect it from minor impacts. Plus, the speaker features impressive battery life, offering up to 12 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. If you need more time in a pinch, the Playtime Boost mode gives you an additional two hours of listening—bringing it to 14 hours total.</p>
<p>The JBL Grip stand out from the other JBL portable speakers with the inclusion of its ambient light. The speaker’s back panel can be set to shine bright in different colors to fit the mood. Great for when the sun goes down the party is still on.</p>

Choose from eye-catching hues like red, blue, green, purple, or teal, or go for the unique camo design if you want something special. For a more understated look, it’s also available in neutral tones like white and black. However, if you go for the camo style, just be cautious when using it outdoors—you wouldn’t want to lose track of it in the grass.</p>



<h2>Party-Ready Features</h2>
<p>For those who want to elevate their audio experience even further, the JBL Grip is compatible with Auracast. This feature lets you pair the speaker with other Auracast-enabled JBL speakers, allowing you to create a stereo sound system or play music in different parts of the room simultaneously.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER is one of my most surprising titles of 2025. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMO that’s reminiscent of STALKER, Fallout 76, and in some ways, Escape from Tarkov. There’s plenty of potential wrapped up in a very ambitious package, which has been assembled by GFA Games, a small studio presenting this inaugural title to an eager audience.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing PIONER for some time, having participated in the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous playtests</a> through 2025. I wasn’t sure what to expect from the game’s early access release, but now that it’s here, I’m having a blast, racking up the hours, and finding myself <strong>very excited </strong>to see where this game goes.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full PIONER review and learn why this is one of my must-watch titles going into 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-pioner-all-about">What’s PIONER All About?</h2>



<p>In PIONER, players find themselves waking up on the island of Tartarus, a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by mutated enemies, mystical anomalies, and warring factions. It’s a bit overwhelming at first, but there’s a neat tutorial that adjusts your expectations accordingly within a couple of hours.</p>



<p>You’ll come to learn that PIONER is spread across several maps that constitute the full island. Each one represents a ‘biome’ that is drastically different from those that came before, and you can travel between them at will.</p>



<p>As you explore this game, you’ll meet faction leaders, build relationships, level up your character, assign skill points, and take part in a wealth of events. There are boss fights, raids, world events, PvP arenas, and a core story to follow.</p>



<p>It’s easy for me to say there’s plenty of meat on PIONER’s bones, and it doesn’t end with the base game, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">GFA plans to expand</a> the title <strong>very soon </strong>via a live-service operating model.</p>



<p>There’s a pretty tough difficulty curve in the game, which boasts some light survival mechanics, but once you’ve found your groove and secured some good equipment, you’ll be much more comfortable.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-thing-about-pioner-is-the-depth">The Best Thing About PIONER is the DEPTH</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks brilliant, and the STALKER influences are very obvious</figcaption></figure>







<p>PIONER has so much to see and do, despite being on the smaller side of what you might expect from an MMO. It’s important to stress that this is an evolving game that has launched in early access; don’t come here if you’re expecting perfection.</p>



<p>With that being said, there are some optimization issues. I’ve had network problems, some inventory-related blips, issues with hit registration, and some clipping, but it’s nothing game-breaking, and the team <strong>always </strong>seems to be aware of what’s going on. This is a very community-led thing, and that’s immediately made obvious if you spend any time at all in the game’s Discord server.</p>



<p>Anyway, back to the depth.</p>



<p>As I explored PIONER’s varied environments, I found side quests popping up ad hoc, and uncovering the new locations highlighted on the map with question marks yielded even more content every time. There’s a great looter-shooter loop that allows you to fill your boots with resources quite easily, which will keep you occupied for some time.</p>



<p>There’s a regular rotation of world events, daily challenges keep you in quick rewards, and there’s a noticeboard in the game’s central hub that allows you to unlock time-bound missions at the press of a button.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to the core story, achievements, challenges, and general open-endedness of the game.</p>



<p>Oh, and there’s a PvP function built on a session-based, arena-driven model that means you can get a taste of PvP without worrying about being griefed in the main world. <strong>But </strong>with that being said, GFA <strong>does plan </strong>to introduce PvP-based maps to accommodate the more bloodthirsty players out there.</p>



<p><strong>And if that wasn’t enough</strong>…</p>



<p>There are puzzle challenges, speedrun courses, minigames, and collectibles to uncover all over the world. Nothing feels like a waste of time, which is really nice.</p>



<h2 id="h-now-to-see-how-long-it-lasts">Now to See How Long it Lasts</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fans of Fallout will LOVE PIONER</figcaption></figure>







<p>PIONER is an MMO, and that means it relies solely on players to remain fuelled and in development. It has a premium price point that’s a bit more accessible than most games, plus there’s a microtransaction-backed economy baked into the game.</p>



<p>But without players feeding the flow, PIONER might struggle to leave early access.</p>



<p>GFA Games has planned a console release for the game, which would broaden the title’s horizons, but there’s no indication of when that’ll drop.</p>



<p>This might sound negative, but it’s more pragmatic. I’m already a fan of PIONER and everything it wants to accomplish, and I believe the developers have the chops to get it done. There’s a phenomenal post-apocalyptic palette within PIONER, and the groundwork has been laid for expansions, which is brilliant.</p>



<p>Sure, some of the animations are a little janky, there are bugs present that might make your experience a little skewed, and it’s not fully optimized for all builds, but if you know what you’re getting into, you can’t be surprised. For an early access game from a small studio that has never released a thing, this is a <strong>hugely ambitious MMO with bite</strong>.</p>



<p>I needed a new Fallout 76 to occupy my time after spending 500 hours in that title’s endgame, and along came PIONER.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>PIONER represents something special. It’s a refreshing, honest attempt to build something extremely ambitious in a world dominated by some immense entities. If GFA Games can iron out the kinks and keep on a steady course out of early access, this could be a hidden gem of the post-apocalyptic space.</p>



<p>I was surprised by how good this game is, and beyond this review, I can guarantee I’ll spend <strong>a lot of time </strong>grinding away at it. This MMO has untold potential, and I’m truly hopeful it stands the test of time.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to give PIONER a try. The game is available <strong>exclusively </strong>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam in early access</a>.</p>

                <p>In the span of a week, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was named Game of the Year by both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-watch-the-indie-game-awards-2025-and-all-the-award-nominees/1100-6536993/" data-ref-id="1100-6536993">The Indie Game Awards</a>. But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI.</p><p>"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself," reads a statement on <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Indie Game Awards' official site</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination."</p><p>Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a> as its new Game of the Year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sorry-were-closed/" data-ref-id="5000-540223">Sorry We're Closed</a> was given the award for Debut Game, which Expedition 33 previously claimed.</p><p>During a feature run on <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">El Pais</a> in July 2025, Expedition 33 producer François Meurisse said, "We use some AI, but not much. The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do." Following the release of that article, Sandfall Interactive released the following statement:</p><p>"The studio states that it was in contact with El Pais on April 25--three months prior to this publication. During these exchanges, Sandfall Interactive indicated that it had used a limited number of pre-existing assets, notably 3D assets sourced from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. None of these assets were created using artificial intelligence."</p><p>Additionally, Sandfall states that the only AI-created assets in the game were placed as "temporary placeholder textures" that were missed during Expedition 33's QA process. Once the assets were identified, they were "removed within five days" and replaced by the intended textures.</p><p>So far, the controversy doesn't seem to have dimmed Expedition 33's popularity.

                <p>Amid Netflix's proposed buyout of Warner Bros. Discovery, the streaming platform has made another big business move, acquiring a gaming startup amid the company's push further into games.</p><p>Netflix has paid an unspecified sum for Estonia-based Ready Player Me, a company that builds the technology used to create gaming assets that are available across different titles.</p><p>"Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds. We've been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I'm now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming," <a href="https://x.com/timmutoke/status/2002068554888389049" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CEO Timmu Tõke said</a>.</p><p>Netflix confirmed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-acquires-gaming-avatar-maker-ready-player-me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechCrunch </a>that Ready Player Me's team of 20 people will join Netflix, but only one of the executives, CTO Rainer Selvet, is shifting to Netflix. There continue to be many unknowns about the deal, too, like when gaming avatars will come to Netflix or which titles will be supported.</p><p>As a result of the buyout, Ready Player Me also <a href="https://readyplayer.me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will close its own services on January 31, 2026, and this includes the company's avatar-maker tool, PlayerZero.</p><p>Ready Player Me sells products and services to developers for avatars that work across multiple different titles. The company points out in its business plan that every game is different, including game engines, devices, and art styles, and it sells the tools that developers can use to handle compatibility in these environments. Ready Player Me counts companies like Ubisoft, Lenovo, and Nvidia among its clients.</p><p>Netflix has always said its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">investments in gaming were experimental in nature</a>, as the company looked to find what worked best. This has led to a rocky road, as Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">cut back on its AAA game plans</a> and is now focusing more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-releases-lineup-of-games-you-can-play-on-your-tv/1100-6536210/" data-ref-id="1100-6536210">mobile and party-focused games</a>. In July, Netflix announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">"ramp up" its gaming efforts</a>.</p><p>Netflix recently announced a blockbuster deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and take ownership of many of the company's entertainment assets, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-could-own-all-these-warner-bros-game-studios-soon/2900-7310/" data-ref-id="2900-7310">including its games portfolio</a>, but not the entire company. Rival Paramount is going straight to shareholders with its own offer, which includes <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-amends-its-superior-30-share-all-cash-offer-warner" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more money and a proposal to buy the entirety of the company.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> is a fantastic game in its own right, as exemplified by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review scores</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the prizes it's starting to win now</a> that the award season is in full swing, but it's all the more impressive because of Sandfall Interactive's small size. The French studio famously only has around 33 (yes, like the game) developers, and we also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that they made this gem <strong>with a budget of under $10 million</strong>.</p>



<p>As one of the biggest game releases of 2025 (according to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final 2025 Alinea Analytics report</a>, the game reached <strong>8.6 million players</strong>, almost a million more than Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly gives the studio the opportunity to scale up in size. However, in an interview <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Knowledge</a>, EDGE's free newsletter dedicated to the games industry, Sandfall Interactive founder, CEO, and Creative Director Guillaume Broche said <strong>there's no such plan</strong> despite the game performing 'a hundred times better' than they had anticipated, and he also explained why.</p>



<p><em>No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves. We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again.</em></p>



<p>It is definitely rare to see a game development studio getting the chance to expand and not take it. It may seem like an unusual choice at first, but it could prove extremely wise in the long run. By staying small, Sandfall won't be forced to follow the 'bigger is better' mentality, and it could also more easily cope with unsuccessful projects if need be. History shows that studios that double or even triple their size after a successful game can get into a lot of trouble if their next project goes wrong for whatever reason.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a substantial free update as a thank-you to the community, adding a new playable environment, new Luminas and weapons, a photo mode, and AMD FSR 4 support on PC, among other things. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-offloads-airtags-at-a-record-low-not-just-airpods-and-macbooks-in-a-surprise-year-end-clearance-2000655042</link>
            <guid>1390006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why are the stocking stuffers always the last thing on everybody’s holiday list? Small gifts can be the best ones, especially when they’re amazingly useful and at near-all-time low prices,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> like this 4-pack of Apple AirTags that’s on sale at Amazon for 34% off and will still arrive in time for Christmas if you order now.</a></p>
<p>Being stocking-sized is only a small part of the appeal for this deal. Normally a $99 buy, a 4-pack of AirTags for just $65 is a major score, and if you’re a devoted Apple fan or even just an iPhone user, the AirTags are by far the best Bluetooth trackers. They’re compact, exceptionally easy to set up, are powered by an easy-to-find replaceable battery, and help you find lost items with amazing precision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4-Pack Covers It All</h2>
<p>One 4-pack of Apple AirTags can cover a huge swath of the items you need to keep tabs on. There is a huge range of inexpensive AirTag holders that fit keychains, along with holders for wallets and even wallets and money clips that have built-in AirTag holders. Backpacks and other bags are even easier — just drop in an AirTag and let it do the work for you. With your iPhone or iPad handy, you’ll have a location on your valuables at all times.</p>
<p>AirTags have become indispensable travel accessories too. Most major airlines have some form of luggage tracking app or service, but to be&nbsp;<em>really</em> sure of where your bags are, an AirTag slipped into an inner compartment is the best method. Distance is no issue, since the AirTags connect to Apple’s massive Find My network, which is able to ping off of nearby Apple devices — without compromising your privacy or safety — to locate your item whether it’s tens or thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Finding far closer objects — the wallet or keys that slid between couch cushions or slipped under a car seat — is fast and easy with the Find My app. The app gives you directions and distances down to the inch, and you can also make the AirTag play a chime to help you narrow down the search.</p>



<h2>Tough Little Tracker</h2>
<p>The AirTag is IP67-rated for dust and water exposure, and the outer shell is tough enough to endure the knocks and drops that come with being attached to a keychain or the outside of a backpack. The battery is good for roughly a year, and the FindMy app on your iOS device will let you know when it’s time to get a fresh battery. When that time comes, the CR2032 disc battery is one of the most common and easy to find batteries, and the AirTag is easy to open. A quick few seconds later, your AirTag is ready to go for another year.</p>
<p>Not many people are going to put AirTags on their holiday gift list, but anyone who finds a 4-pack of these top-tier Bluetooth trackers in their stocking will be very pleasantly surprised. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">The 4-pack of Apple AirTags on sale at Amazon for just $65 is a thoughful and exceptionally useful gift idea</a>, and if you order now they’ll still make it in time for Christmas.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ark 2 Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2020</p>
      </div>
<p>Studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.</p><p>Snail Games also confirmed that 4 million copies of Ark: Survival Ascended have been sold in the two years since it first launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>First announced in 2020, Ark 2 was originally scheduled to launch in 2023, but it was delayed to 2024. After missing that date, the studio has largely kept quiet about progress on the game. Vin Diesel is aiding development on the game--and starring in it--under the fancy role of "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vin-diesel-will-not-only-star-in-ark-2-hes-also-an-executive-producer/1100-6485514/">president of creative convergence</a>" at Studio Wildcard.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-animated-series-with-impressive-voice-cast-gets-surprise-release-out-now/1100-6522008/">The game has also been adapted into an animated series</a> that debuted last year without much fanfare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-the-animated-series-part-2-finally-gets-a-release-window/1100-6536005/">and the second part of Ark: The Animated Series</a> will arrive in 2026.</p>

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> released, there has been much discussion about the game's performances. While all are exemplary, and saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Jennifer English and Ben Starr receive nominations for Best Performer at this year's The Game Awards</a>, there has since been debate over what exactly it means to be nominated in this category.</p>
<p>You see, another Clair Obscur actor to receive a nomination at The Game Awards was Charlie Cox, known for the likes of Daredevil and Stardust, who provided the voice of the game's protagonist Gustave. However, the character's motion performance was done by French actor Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Back in November, Cox said while he was of course delighted to see his contribution to Clair Obscur recognised, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-charlie-cox-thrilled-by-game-awards-nomination-but-says-gustaves-mocap-actor-deserves-the-credit">as much of the applaud needed to go to Cazorla</a> as well. "Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process," Cox said. I recently had the oppertunity to sit down and chat with Cazorla about all things Clair Obscur, and of course our conversation soon turned to Cox's comments.</p>

<p>"First of all, it was an incredible honour for me that Charlie spoke publicly and acknowledged my work. I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," Cazorla told me, before he shed more light on the process of bringing Gustave to life.</p><p>"We started by doing the performance capture without any particular constraints, approaching it like a film, learning the lines, playing the scenes, and following Guillaume's direction," Cazorla said. "Once the shoot was done and the scenes were integrated into the game engine by the cinematic team, that's when the voice actors stepped in and recorded their performances."</p>
<p>He added that his part in Gustave's overall character and Cox's "happened at different stages of the process", something that "is very common in game production". Cazorla explained once the physical side of the performance was locked in, Cox then went into the studio to record Gustave's lines. "I only discovered the final result months later, directly in the game," Cazorla shared.</p>
<p>"In the end, it's really the combination of these two performances, along with the incredible writing and development work, that gave birth to the character."</p>
<p>But, how did Cazorla feel to not receive a nomination for his part in Gustave's character development? Does he feel awards shows should change how they recognise performances generally?</p>
<p>"When it comes to a potential motion capture category, I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Cazorla replied. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors. For example, Maelle with Charlotte Hoepffner and Jennifer English, Lune with Estelle Darnault and Kirsty Rider, Verso with Ben Starr and myself. Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character."</p>
<p>As such, Cazorla believes "the fairest way to celebrate performers" is to "celebrate the character" instead.</p>
<p>"That's something the DICE Awards already do, and I think it's a very intelligent approach. If you reward Gustave as a character and his impact on players, you acknowledge Charlie Cox for the voice, myself for the performance capture, but also the writers who shaped his personality, the character artists, and everyone who contributed to bringing him to life."</p><p>Closing, Cazorla said: "Video games are, by nature, a collaborative art form, and characters resonate because many artists give them their soul. Celebrating a Best Character category feels more logical to me than isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p>

<p>If you want to hear more from Cazorla , my full chat with him is going live in the coming days. Here, the actor discusses how he found out about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, his audition and meeting the team at Sandfall, performing the motion capture for several of the game's characters, and much, much more. Stay tuned!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/22/assetto-corsa-rally-gets-an-ice-cold-update-0-2-in-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1389988</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first content update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-rally">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> has arrived, bringing an appropriate amount of snow and ice to the table for the season, alongside improved physics and performance. Available now, here’s what’s featured in Assetto Corsa Rally update 0.2.</p>
<p>The physics engine within Assetto Corsa has been evolved in multiple ways, with the headline being the introduction of snow physics and support for studded tyres. This allows you to take on ice and snow rallies where grip is at its lowest, and you can test your skill at the new Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit, as well as in time attack and free practice for these mountain roads.&nbsp;And what better way to take this on than with the newly introduced Alpine A110 Group 4, which is an icon of rallying in the early 1970s?</p>


<p>More broadly, the physics for gravel and tarmac racing have been improved alongside tyre models, and all vehicles benefit from fixes related to&nbsp;wheel offsets, rim textures, and suspension. The force feedback has also been made more consistent, especially for behaviour under braking. And the sound mix has been refined alongside new audio for snow environments and the A110.</p>
<p>To try all of this out, there’s two new Events groups, so there’s now a total of 25 events in AC Rally.</p>
<p>And then there’s just a litany of quality of life and bug fixing improvements. Here’s the full patch notes:</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is an exciting addition to Kunos Simulazioni’s sim-racing franchise, especially when rally racing is in flux after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">EA halting Codemasters’ rallying development</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027/">KT Racing is revving back up to resume their WRC series</a>. While Kunos themselves are hard at work on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-evo">Assetto Corsa Evo</a>, AC Rally is in development at Supernova Games Studios in a technical partnership that builds on Kunos’ exceptional physics modelling.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-final-clearance-on-am4-motherboards-rog-strix-b550-f-wifi-ii-3rd-gen-ryzen-drops-to-a-record-low-2000655008</link>
            <guid>1389982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a desktop PC from scratch, or upgrading your CPU? We’ve found a deal that lets you pick a strong motherboard without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">The Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II – an option that offers exceptional power and great gaming features – is currently available for just $120 at Amazon, down from its usual $180 price.</a> This is one of the lowest we have seen this motherboard drop to, but as you’d expect, the offer wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later, before that happens. Note that the package is likely going to arrive after Christmas. If you were planning to surprise a gamer or a creative in your life with it, keep the shipping timeline in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Feature-Rich</h2>
<p>This motherboard is an excellent option for AMD Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series, as well as 5000 and 4000 G-series desktop processors. The thoughtful 14-phase VRM design (12 main and 2 auxiliary) lets it handle the powerful options well without overheating, making it great for anyone looking to work with resource-intensive programs and heavier projects frequently. It supports Windows 11, plus allows for up to 128GB of RAM, which is more than enough to handle serious multitasking.</p>
<p>Build quality is just as exceptional, with RGB lighting adding a nice aesthetic touch to the setup. The feature-rich board is also PCIe 4.0-ready, which translates into faster data transfer speeds, especially when paired with a high-end NVMe SSD. You will be able to load games, launch apps, and move files (even the larger ones) around without waiting long. What’s more, WiFi 6E (802.11ax) and Intel 2.5 Gb Ethernet with ASUS LANGuard come together to ensure smooth networking. On the other hand, ports like dual M.2 slots, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, plus HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 outputs make it convenient to connect other devices for a fuller, more productive setup.</p>



<p>The box includes the motherboard itself, an ASUS 2×2 dual Wi-Fi antenna, an addressable RGB extension cable, a user manual, a support CD, and an ROG sticker pack. The bundle also includes a 60-day subscription to AIDA64 Extreme.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a solid motherboard to add to your setup without breaking the bank, the Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II is one of the best options to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">We’d highly recommend it at its full $180 price, but the current 33% discount makes it much more affordable and, honestly, a no-brainer.</a> The $120 asking is nothing compared to all the features it’s packed with. Just be sure to snap it up quickly, because the deal is selling out fast. Place your orders before it expires, or before the stock runs out for good.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Second Expedition Window Confirmed by Countdown]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>1389976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has pushed live the Expedition Project window in ARC Raiders <strong>today</strong>, which means that players can finally make good on their efforts over the last few weeks and <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. This is effectively the game’s global reset mechanic, only unlike other extraction games, it’s an optional step.</p>



<p>Users have spotted that the <strong>next </strong>Expedition window should arrive in ARC Raiders from February 22 onwards, if the countdown is anything to go by.</p>







<h2 id="h-one-finished-and-into-another">One Finished and Into Another</h2>



<p>If you’ve completed your Expedition Project today, you’ll be faced with the daunting task of starting from scratch. That means you’ll find yourself at level one with an empty stash, no skills, and empty workbenches, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It also means you’ll be taking advantage of certain temporary buffs, a small stash boost, and an exclusive new skin, <strong>Patchwork</strong>.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition Project have noticed that you can start building your <strong>next </strong>Expedition caravan <strong>instantly</strong>. As soon as you’ve reset that event, you start moving on to the next one. That means that you’ll work through the phases all over again, collecting the resources required to go a second time around.</p>



<p>Now to what’s next.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders players on PC can use a trick to manipulate the game. They do this by changing their system date while <strong>in the game,</strong> forcing the state forward and tricking the game’s internal calendar. By doing this, some users have revealed future map conditions, trials, and other additions.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition have been given a fresh timer, but if you just manipulate the game in this way, you could have seen that timer anyway.</p>



<p>Given that each Expedition loop, or ‘season’, lasts two months, this was hardly rocket science.</p>



<p>Unlike the Expedition itself. That’s rocket science.</p>



<p>So, if you’re wondering when the next Expedition hits in ARC Raiders, you’ve got something of an answer. It’s worth stressing that these things are subject to change until the update is firmly delivered, as <strong>the current Expedition </strong>was delayed by Embark Studios.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re going to be hitting the wipe in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘If You Watch the OD Trailer Many Times There’s a Hint’, Says Kojima; ‘We Built a Completely New Medium’ with Microsoft]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/if-you-watch-the-od-trailer-many-times-theres-a-hint-says-kojima-we-built-new-medium/</link>
            <guid>1389961</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Visionary game designer and industry legend <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong> was recently featured <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Nikkei Xtrend</a>, where he <span>discussed, among various topics, the enigmatic upcoming&nbsp;<strong>OD</strong>&nbsp;Project once again</span>. As translated and reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gamesradar</a>, Kojima teased that the most recent teaser trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a> includes a 'hint' of some kind that players can discover after watching it carefully again and again.</p>



<p><em>I can't say anything else, or Mr Phil will be mad at me. But actually, if you watch the teaser trailer many times there's a hint. I really can't say what it is, but if you watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer, it reads 'for all players and screamers'. That's also a big hint.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OD - KNOCK Teaser Trailer - [ESRB] 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the Nikkei Xtrend interview, Kojima also reiterated that it is a 'completely new medium' that his studio built with the help of <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which is publishing OD, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-kojima-partnership-brand-new-game-cloud-powered-xbox-bethesda-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.</p>



<p><em>I think when you first see OD, it looks like horror. But the system it uses isn't ordinary. Everything is made in a game engine, and a game is a game, but it's still a system like no other. That's why we built a completely new medium together with Microsoft.</em></p>



<p>OD <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being co-written with <strong>Jordan Peele</strong></a>, a filmmaker known for his horror works, and will feature Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, who sadly passed away last month before he could complete his motion performance in the game.</p>



<p>We know that it will leverage Xbox's cloud gaming technology, but we don't know how. Last year, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that it was a risky project, and as of two weeks ago, he candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he still doesn't know if it will work out or not in the end.</p>



<p>OD is supposed to be the studio's next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and before <strong>PHYSINT</strong>, a new Metal Gear Solid-like stealth IP that will be made <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in collaboration with PlayStation</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DJI Clears Out Microphone Bundle Beyond Drones, Mic 3 (2 TX + 1 RX + Charging Case) Hits an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-clears-out-microphone-bundle-beyond-drones-mic-3-2-tx-1-rx-charging-case-hits-an-all-time-low-2000654885</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to be recognized as a serious creator, it is essential to give your audio the attention it deserves. Whether you’re conducting street interviews or recording reaction videos for platforms like TikTok, your audience will notice the sound quality. Even if it’s on a subconscious level, poor audio can make your content feel low-budget. In fact, I’d argue that audio quality is even more important than video quality in some cases, even though it might sound counterintuitive. Investing in a high-quality wireless lavalier microphone setup can drastically improve the sound in your videos. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">A great option to consider is the DJI Mic 3 kit, which is currently 21% off, bringing the price down from $329 to $259—an impressive $70 discount.</a></p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 kit includes two transmitters, a wireless receiver, and a charging case. All the components come pre-linked, so they’re ready to use right out of the box. The system is also compatible with USB-C and Lightning adapters, which are included in the package, giving you more connectivity options for various devices. You can clip the transmitter to your shirt, your hat, I suppose just hold it between your fingers which is now becoming the norm on TikTok and Instagram.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intelligent Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>These microphones support intelligent noise-canceling, allowing the them to capture clear vocals in detailed 32-bit audio while minimizing unwanted background noise. These mics can handle unpredictable environments like busy streets or crowded convention halls. Plus, the kit comes with two windscreens to further reduce the interference of wind noises when you’re filming outdoors.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 system provides an impressive wireless range of over 1,300 feet, giving you greater freedom to shoot in various locations without worrying about losing signal. This extended range allows you to move around with more flexibility.</p>



<p>Battery life is another major selling point. Both the transmitters and the receiver can operate for up to 28 hours, ensuring you’ll have plenty of power for extended shoots. The included charging case acts as a portable power bank, capable of recharging the mics when you’re on the go. If you’re only using one transmitter at a time, you can keep the second one in the case and swap it in when the first one runs low on battery. The case is compact, fitting all the components neatly together, making it easy to pack up when you’re done filming.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to upgrade from your phone’s built-in microphone to a more professional setup, the DJI Mic 3 lavalier kit is a solid choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">For just $259, you’ll get two transmitters, the receiver, a charging case, and other accessories—at a significant discount.</a> Don’t miss out on this opportunity to improve your audio and take your content creation to professional levels.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Debunks That It Sets a 30% Profit Margin Goal for Xbox Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-30-percent-debunk/</link>
            <guid>1389952</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has debunked past claims that it has told its gaming division Xbox that it must target a 30% profit margin.</p>







<p>The debunking came as part of a new <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC report</a> that spoke with Microsoft about multiple issues and reports the company has seen over the past year.</p>



<p>CNBC acknowledges that a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said Microsoft has set its gaming division, Xbox, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ambitious goal of achieving a 30% profit margin</a>, which has led to layoffs and cancelled projects. </p>



<p>According to Bloomberg, the target was set by Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, who said that the 30% target was “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox. The report was subsequently backed up by other industry figures, who said that they had heard similar news of the ambitious targets.</p>



<p>The 30% target is much higher than the industry standard, which averages 17-22%.</p>



<p>In response to the rumor, Microsoft reportedly told CNBC that while the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.</p>







<div><p>Xbox has had a tough year, with thousands of jobs impacted and several projects cancelled, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark, Rare’s Everwild, and ZeniMax’s MMO under the codename Blackbird. Last week, it was announced that Xbox would not be having an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Xbox Wrapped’ this year due to budget constraints</a>.</p><p>It’s currently unclear whether Bloomberg will redact or offer more insight into Microsoft’s ambitious goals, but should we get more information, we will update this article.</p></div>

The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do and what to invest in. And, of course, technology has allowed us to do things that were unthinkable a short time ago. Unreal Engine 5’s tools and assets have been very important in improving the graphics, gameplay, and cinematics.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meurisse’s comment resurfaced amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">a backlash to comments from Larian boss Swen Vincke in the wake of the developer’s high-profile announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards</a>. The original news came from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg interview</u></a> in which Vincke said that Larian was "pushing hard" [Bloomberg's phrasing] on generative AI, even though it hasn't led to big gains in efficiency. Specifically, the studio was said to be using the technology to "explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text." [again, Bloomberg's phrasing].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke later addressed the backlash, and has promised an AMA to answer questions from fans. All the while, a light has been shone on Clair Obscur, which leads us to the Indie Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur had won Game of the Year and Debut Game from the Indie Game Awards, but both awards are now retracted. Explaining the decision, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Indie Game Awards said</a>:</p><blockquote>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination. While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place. As a result, the IGAs nomination committee has agreed to officially retract both the Debut Game and Game of the Year awards.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Each award went to the next highest-ranked game in its respective category; Sorry We’re Closed now has Debut Game, and Blue Prince now has Game of the Year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, El País has updated its original article to include a statement from Sandfall clarifying its use of generative AI in the making of Clair Obscur:</p><blockquote>The studio states that it was in contact with El País on April 25 — three months prior to this publication. During these exchanges, Sandfall Interactive indicated that it had used a limited number of pre-existing assets, notably 3D assets sourced from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. None of these assets were created using artificial intelligence.</blockquote><blockquote>Sandfall Interactive further clarifies that there are no generative Al-created assets in the game. When the first Al tools became available in 2022, some members of the team briefly experimented with them to generate temporary placeholder textures. Upon release, instances of a placeholder texture were removed within five days to be replaced with the correct textures that had always been intended for release, but were missed during the Quality Assurance process.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s Vincke's latest statement in full:</p><blockquote>It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</blockquote><blockquote>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</blockquote><blockquote>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</blockquote><blockquote>To give you more insight, we’ll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you’ll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!</blockquote><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Excellent, the AI generated textures in Clair Obscur were indeed placeholders and were replaced with custom assets. The other AI generated poster that was present in the starting area (don't have a screenshot of it now) was also removed. <a href="https://t.co/UQbfLuyj8e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/UQbfLuyj8e</a> <a href="https://t.co/5xgqsCmZpC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/5xgqsCmZpC</a></p>— Nyanomancer (@nyanomancer) <a href="https://twitter.com/nyanomancer/status/1917435885429150176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in video game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI</u></a>." Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio has said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the debate around the use of generative AI to build video games rages on, Tim Sweeney, boss of Fortnite developer Epic Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-stop-at-ai-use-we-could-have-mandatory-disclosures-for-what-shampoo-brand-the-developer-uses-epic-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-should-ditch-its-ai-generated-content-disclosure">has waded in to call on Valve to ditch its AI Generated Content Disclosure for Steam games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve’s rules mean developers must disclose their use of AI-generated content on a game’s Steam store page. For example, the Steam page for Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders includes a note from the developer on how the game uses AI-generated content: “during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>New details have been revealed regarding the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-file-class-action-lawsuit-over-cancelled-kotor-2-dlc">Knights of the Old Republic 2 false advertisement lawsuit</a> for Switch consoles. This includes an argument made by one expert brought in by Aspyr who stated that the fan-made Restored Content mod the missing DLC was based on had "no economic value".
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga">This information comes from Game File</a>, which broke down the legal battle between developer Aspyr and an individual who sued the company after DLC advertised in a trailer for the Switch version <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotor-2-switch-dlc-cancelled-after-third-party-objection-says-aspyr">was cut from the full release</a>.</p>
<p>This report claims Aspyr made several arguments in an attempt to curb the lawsuit, which ended in a settlement earlier this year. These include the claim that the tease for the DLC couldn't have been widely seen, as it appeared at the end of a YouTube trailer. Aspyr's own lawyers argued: "Many YouTube viewers skip [videos] after the first five seconds."</p>

<p>Aspyr also reportedly brought in additional documents in April, including expert testiomy from former Blizzard product manager Frank Gilson. He explained the restored content mod the DLC was based on was fan-made and offered for free. It therefore had no "economic value", a belief that stemmed from the fact the community creates these mods and doesn't charge for them. </p><p>The lawsuit would progress further onto even more colourful topics, including accusations of demonic possession, stemming from a claim that an Aspyr attorney yelled at his client: "as if possessed by a demon". This framing was rejected by the attorney in question, who said he raised his voice so he could finish his sentence and return the conversation to "productive discussion".</p>
<p>There was also the claim it could take decades to learn the appropriate email address in order to get the rights to make a Star Wars game. This comes from a redaction of certain email addresses in documents filed this April. These were redacted as: "[...] they reveal a key trade secret; the identities of the right persons to work with at Lucasfilm to secure access to Lucasfilm intellectual property. Those contacts reflect years, sometimes decades, of work cultivating relationships and revealing them would cause Aspyr lasting business harm."</p>

</p>
<p>While this particular chapter in the Kotor saga was a bit of a messy one, there is hope for fans of the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">During The Game Awards, Fate of the Old Republic</a> was revealed, alongside the news that Casey Hudson would be involved. Hudson was famously involved with the original Knights of the Old Republic game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the top eight games have all played a bit of a switcheroo, while the latter two spots in the top ten are taken up by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a>.

<p><strong>Mario Kart</strong> continues to demonstrate its widespread appeal, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a> once again taking up their positions in the top ten.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ark 2’s release window has been updated again, and the developers are now targeting 2028. </p>



<p>During the latest Snail Games Investor Day (via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>), the co-founder of developer Studio Wildcard, Jeremy Stielglitz, confirmed that Ark 2 is planned for a 2028 release. The game’s release window has changed several times since the title was first announced. It was set for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-2-still-planned-for-late-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late 2024</a> release, then the developers changed that with no new date. Now, it seems we will have to wait at least two more years before we see Ark 2 in action. </p>







<h2 id="h-ark-survival-ascended-sells-over-4-million-copies-will-get-ark-2-inspired-update-in-2027">Ark Survival Ascended Sells Over 4 Million Copies, Will Get Ark 2 Inspired Update in 2027</h2>



<p>However, players will be able to get their “first taste” of Ark 2 slightly earlier than 2028, but it will still be a long wait anyway. The developers reveal that a significant update is planned for Ark Survival Ascended, inspired by the sequel, which is set to be released towards the end of 2027. Snail Games had another major announcement for Ark Survival Ascended, revealing that the latest version of the game has sold over 4 million copies. </p>



<h2 id="h-ark-lost-colony-to-bring-new-features-and-story-will-be-portrayed-through-mappa-anime">ARK: Lost Colony To Bring New Features and Story Will be Portrayed through Mappa Anime</h2>



<p>As we wait for Ark 2’s release, the next major expansion for Ark Survival Ascended is coming soon. Ark: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a> will introduce a new narrative and expand the title’s scope. The developers have also confirmed that it will include new features, such as the ability to “recruit human characters to your tribe that are controlled by the computer.” Additionally, the narrative of this expansion will be showcased through Mappa anime scenes starring Michelle Yeoh and UE5 Metahuman cinematics featuring Madeleine Madden, Auli’i Cravalho, and Karl Urban.</p>



<h2 id="h-ark-survival-ascended-roadmap">ARK: Survival Ascended Roadmap</h2>



<p>The developers also revealed the following projects we can look forward to before Ark 2 releases in 2028. We will first see the arrival of Ark: Survival of the Fittest, an esports-focused spin-off of the core game, where 60 players battle, culminating in a showdown between dinosaur armies. This will arrive in the first quarter of 2026. </p>



<p><span>In the second quarter of 2026, players will see the arrival of Bob’s True Tales: Tides of Fo</span>rtune, a pirate-themed expansion for the base game and a new map called&nbsp;ARK Genesis. The third quarter of 2026 will see the arrival of ARK World Creator, a new upgrade that helps “turn the modding tools in the game into something more akin to what is seen in&nbsp;Fortnite’s&nbsp;UEFN&nbsp;or&nbsp;Roblox.”</p>



<p>Then, in the fourth quarter of 2026, Ark Dragontopia will arrive, followed by Ark Atlantis in 2027 Q1. The second quarter will see ARK: Bob’s True Tales Galaxy Wars release, which is all about large space ships, space battles, star fighters, and more. Lastly, 2027 Q4 will see the release of Legacy of Santiago, a prequel to Ark 2 that ties into that narrative and tests the game’s mechanics and features. This is “most likely not the last update for&nbsp;ARK: Survival Ascended”, said the devs. </p>

            <p>The rebooted 2013 Tomb Raider made its Switch debut just a matter of weeks ago, and thanks to the "passionate response" from the community, port developer Aspyr may now consider bringing the trilogy's final two entries to Nintendo's platform as well.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy kicked off when the team at Crystal Dynamics dropped an inexperienced and somewhat naive Lara Croft on the storm-riddled shores of Yamatai. Her story then continued in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, which took Lara to Siberia, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, where the trilogy concluded in the sweltering jungles of South America.</p>

<p>Of course, many Switch players are now wondering if these last two entries in the most recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> will eventually make their way to the platform as well, and allow them to finish Lara's rebooted arc.</p>
<p>"We have definitely seen this question," <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/">Aspyr told Nintendo Everything</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-fans-might-get-the-entire-tomb-raider-survivor-trilogy-thanks-to-their-passionate-response">Nintendo Life</a>). The studio added it has already reintroduced Nintendo players to the classic era of Tomb Raider with its remasters of the first six games in the series.</p>
<p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era (1-6) and now the 'origin story' of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," Aspyr said when asked about future Tomb Raider ports of Rise and Shadow.</p>
<p>"We can't announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities," the studio closed. So, would you like to see Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider arrive on Switch consoles?</p>

<p>Along with Tomb Raider 2013 arriving on Switch, this month has been a rather exciting one for fellow fans of Lara's. At The Game Awards, two new games were also announced to be in the works. The first - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">a remake of the original Tomb Raider known as Legacy of Atlantis</a> - is due to be released next year. Then, in 2027, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">all-new series entry known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst will arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Amazon's live-action show still to come, with filming beginning next month. Cast members so far include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as a character called Wallace</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">Jason Isaacs in an undisclosed role</a>.</p>

			<p>Polyphony Digital's <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong> may have been released nearly four years ago, but according to series creator and studio founder Kazunori Yamauchi, it's still doing extremely well.</p>



<p>In an interview with media outlets that attended the Gran Turismo World Series 2025 World Finals in Fukuoka, Japan, the legendary game designer (and racing driver) revealed that the game <strong>is regularly played by over two million players each month</strong>, and perhaps even more importantly, its player base is still growing. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/gt7-2-million-monthly-users-20251221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as GTPlanet reported it</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gran Turismo 7 has been released for several years, but still, the active users are currently over 2 million people, and the new users are increasing. The status that Gran Turismo 7 is in now is probably the best of any Gran Turismo titles that we’ve had in the past. We’ve never experienced this phenomenon before, and neither has PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Polyphony Digital experimented with live service in the previous entry, GT Sport, but it's clear that GT7 has received a much warmer welcome from series fans and continues to keep many players interested through various updates. The most recent one, Spec III (Update 1.65), launched on December 4 and introduced:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight cars (Ferrari 296 GT3 ’23, Ferrari 296 GTB ’22, FIAT Panda 30 CL ’85, Gran Turismo F3500‑B, Mine's BNR34 GT‑R N1 base, Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R ’97, Polestar 5 Performance ’26, and Renault Espace F1 ’95).</li>



<li>Two tracks (Yas Marina Circuit and Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve).</li>



<li>The new Data Logger feature lets players load data from the previous attempt or replays to view and compare data such as racing lines, throttle and brake inputs, speed, and engine RPM, all in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside Spec III, Gran Turismo 7 players can also purchase the new Power Pack for $29.99. This premium DLC adds 50 new races across 20 themed categories, such as 24-hour races, six unique cars specially tuned by Gran Turismo, tail-to-nose battles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-sophy-announced-by-sony-ai-and-polyphony-its-an-ai-breakthrough-capable-of-competing-against-top-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo Sophy</a> 3.0, and is bundled with 5,000,000 in-game Credits.</p>



<p>The game's only real downside is the aggressive microtransactions system, which also caused its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Wccftech review score</a> to drop from 9 to 8/10. From the point of view of PC players, there's also the 'downside' that the game still isn't available, whereas most other PlayStation exclusives have already been ported. </p>



<p>Three years ago, a Yamauchi statement about a PC version being considered <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was widely reported</a> in the press. However, a few weeks later, the founder of Polyphony rectified the statement, clarifying that the possibility was 'not zero' but that there was still nothing being actively done on that front yet. Unfortunately, as of the end of 2025, there are still no updates on the port.</p>

<p>It's no Fiorentina jersey, but it's something</p>

<figure data-uuid="26ca35de83f1c"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ca35de83f1c/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has a long history of sponsoring professional sports teams, and one club it's continued to support over the years is the Japanese football side, Kyoto Sanga, which currently competes in Japan's top-flight competition known as the J-League.</p>
<p>Nintendo owns 16.6% of this club, <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/">and ever since it signed on in 1993</a>, the video game giant's traditional 19th-century kanji logo has appeared on the back of the kit, above the player number. Now, in a slight and subtle update to the shirt for the new season, the logo is surrounded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>.</p>
<p>So, while the traditional logo might not be quite as recognisable here in the west, you can now at least impress fellow Nintendo fans (<em>and maybe some sports ones</em>) with these colourful Pikmin.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15b9952a8d147"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15b9952a8d147/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via @Genki_JPN on X / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Again, while it might not be <em>quite</em> as easy to spot as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2019/09/feature_remember_when_video_game_football_shirts_were_a_big_deal">Nintendo's ACF Fiorentina kit featuring the company's red (and iconic) "racetrack" logo</a>, any fan of Nintendo should definitely notice. As for the rest of the kit, as you can see in the images above, it features the usual purples, white and red colours – matching the club's emblem.</p>
<p>As Nintendo fans should know, Shigeru Miyamoto has a soft spot for Pikmin, and has previously mentioned how he considers them to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/miyamoto-considers-pikmin-to-be-nintendos-most-global-characters">Nintendo's most "global characters"</a>, so it's no surprise they continue to pop up pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>On a <em>slightly</em> related note, Nintendo this week rolled out a new game update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> on the Switch to fix multiple bugs.</p>
