<p>Perhaps, most notably, the Switch 2 update will add "image quality and performance settings". Additionally, there is also a first-person perspective mode. Here's the translation from the official Falcom website (via Gematsu):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added “Image Quality / Performance Settings” to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</em></li>
<li><em>Added options to adjust text speed and text auto-advance speed.</em></li>
<li><em>Added one-key shortcuts for actions that normally require two key presses on keyboard.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a first-person mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Added the option to hide in-game user interface.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected various text errors.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed other miscellaneous bugs.</em></li>
</ul><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wznjtu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p><em>*Updates for Nintendo Switch™ 2/Switch will be released at a later date.</em></p>
<p>To activate this first-person mode on the Switch 2 and Switch, you'll need to press R + ZL. And to hide the user interface, you'll need to press R + ZR.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, here are the updates for Version 1.04:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added camera distance setting to options</em></li>
<li><em>Adjusted the Brave Attack input acceptance time in High Speed ​​Mode</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where some battles could become unprogressible.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could occur when jumping between maps.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could occur when operating the Orbment menu.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected typos and omissions</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed other bugs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In our review here on Nintendo Life, we mentioned how there were some "slight performance issues" in the Switch 2 version. Here's part of what we had to say about this particular version of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The journey of our sibling Bracers is most impressive on Switch 2, which targets 60fps...Undocked is notably the best mode and runs with what feels like flawless stability in combat and wandering the open world. Docked is also strong, but there is the odd frame hiccup in population centres and during visually busy battles. The game isn’t a visual powerhouse by any means, but it’s nice to see the characters adventure through lovingly designed environments without any compromises on the newer console."</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-realm-verneath-opened-by-slipknot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-realm-%E2%80%98vernearth%E2%80%99-opened-by-slipknot-member-as-%E2%80%98a-surrealist-experience%E2%80%99.1321543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the end of October, Vernearth will go live, bringing a Realm to Minecraft players everywhere that bends the rules of time and reality. It is composed of more than 100 million blocks and offers ‘endless opportunities for creation, combat, and exploration,’ allowing users to build, battle or ‘just lose themselves in the atmosphere.’</p>



<p>Oh, and it has been created by M. Shawn ‘Clown’ Crahan, a founding member of Slipknot and lover of Minecraft. It has been stressed that Crahan will be playing alongside fans when the Realm goes live at the end of October.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-vernearth-powered-by-slipknot">Enter Vernearth, Powered by Slipknot</h2>



<p>In a release, Vernearth is described as something almost otherworldly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What is Vernearth? For Clown, Vernearth isn’t just a game world, it’s an extension of his creativity outside Slipknot, suitable for players of all ages. This isn’t just Minecraft. It’s Vernearth. Vernearth is a surrealist experience. Think of it as a place where time and reality don’t play by the rules. </p>



<p>Over 100 million blocks make up this ever-changing landscape, home to mysterious beings called Mind Stewards and endless opportunities for creation, combat, and exploration. Whether you want to build, battle, or just lose yourself in the atmosphere, Vernearth is designed to pull you in and never let go.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the imagery provided, Vernearth resembles a gothic underworld of sorts, teeming with dark architecture that you’d probably be comfortable linking to a brand like Slipknot.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar, Minecraft Realms is a subscription service that allows players to set up, manage, and explore private servers that have unique rules, modifications, and shared server facilities.</p>



<p>From what we can see in the image provided by the team, Vernearth will feature some kind of daily reward system, awarding chests to players who log in every day.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d want to explore Vernearth? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The playtest was extended to Switch 2 in July</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="54d885022693f"><a title="Switch Online Playtest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54d885022693f/switch-online-playtest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another patent has been published for the Switch Online Playtest Program, which was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-switch-online-playtest-program-returns-includes-switch-2-support">extended to Switch 2 users</a> in July.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3m2rzkc4lx22b">Nintendo Patents Watch on Bluesky</a>, the patent was originally filed in Japan in April last year and in the US in April 2025. The latest one was published in the US this week and reportedly describes a system in which the player can "intuitively select multiple objects in a virtual space by walking around them".</p>
<p>Here's the official abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A player character is caused to move in a three-dimensional virtual space according to a first operation input. In the three-dimensional virtual space, a first object that connects a reference point set at a position according to a second operation input, and the player character is generated. A shape of the first object is changed based on movement of the player character. Whena second object is surrounded by the first object in the three-dimensional virtual space, the second object is designated for further game processing."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wznjtu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>As highlighted by the same source, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf">mentioned earlier this year</a> how the playtest was "related to a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service", but did not elaborate on this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We plan to leverage results and other learnings gained from this intiative in future Nintendo Switch Online services, but we have not announced any details".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although details and footage about the first playtest were leaked online, Nintendo kept the same requests in place for the second playtest - asking participants to not "discuss or disclose content" about the program with others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 2’s Candy Factory takes a sinister right turn in Little Nightmares 3. It’s where the game starts to become unhinged and reveal its true colors. While exploring the mysteries of the facility, you need to find Dolls in Little Nightmares 3. Our Candy Factory guide is the perfect walkthrough to do this.</p>



<p>It’s hard to keep your eyes on the ball in Candy Factory. A nasty spider-bug lady is chasing you, and the whole building is a gargantuan cesspool of unnerving sights and sounds. Hidden amongst its many rooms, corridors, and hidey-holes are Doll collectibles.</p>



<p>If you’re after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>‘s collection of secret Dolls—especially for the game’s trophy list—you need this guide (and some prayers after).</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dolls-in-candy-factory-chapter-2-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Dolls in Candy Factory Chapter 2 in Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another five to go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must find five Dolls throughout Candy Factory in Little Nightmares 3 if you want to own every doll in the level.</strong></p>



<p>A tiny spoiler alert: Not every <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> chapter has five Dolls. That’s why it’s important to address this question in each Doll guide. Candy Factor does have five, so let’s get into the level!</p>

<figure><figcaption>Just out of your vision. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The compulsory path to completing Candy Factory takes you into a large room filled with filing cabinets, folders, and the chapter’s main antagonist. Sneak across the room to the other side and climb up the shelves. <strong>Reach the beams at the top</strong>, and when you start walking toward the screen, turn left at the end, and the first Doll is at the end of the beam.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-2-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 2 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s there, we promise you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Make your way through Candy Factory until you reach a room where you pull down a lever, making the bugs in the room flee, allowing Low and Alone to jump up and down on the platform in the middle of the room. After falling into the next room, climb up the ladder to the right, go through the vent, and move on until you climb up through the grate that puts you in front of a <strong>powered-down elevator</strong>. Take a left through the hole in the wall, and in the room with stacked tubs, <strong>use our screenshot above</strong> to find the second Doll.</p>

<figure><figcaption>One of the more hidden Dolls in the game. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you’ve restored full power to the elevator, ride it up. Open the window shutter, taking you outside, and instead of running toward you (the player) to carry on, from the window, <strong>run down the long pipe in the opposite direction</strong>—left of the hot air balloon in the background. Climb through the window at the end, and claim Doll number three.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It pays to explore. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll find Doll four not long after the third one. Once you return to the beaten path, you naturally encounter <strong>a room filled with static TVs, the chapter’s boss enemy again, and a wooden plank you need to walk across</strong>. Do this, wait for the boss to leave, and descend to the bottom of the room. Instead of opening up the two-person vent, go to the opposite side of the room to find the Doll sitting small and cute in the open room.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-5-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 5 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end is nigh. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A final chase sequence with the Candy Factory’s boss</strong> results in them being squished in a hydraulic press (lovely, I know), and the door in the press room unlocks once they’re defeated. Go down the long corridor and into the room on the left. The Doll is on the table next to a machine.</p>

<p>Necorpolis is where Low and Alone’s journey begins in Little Nightmares 3. The game starts brighter and sandier than you might expect, but just because it’s light doesn’t mean you’ll have an easy time tracking down every Chapter 1 Doll in Little Nightmares 3’s Necropolis level.</p>



<p>It depends on which side of the fence you reside where collectibles are concerned. Some people love them, and some hate them. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> does have collectibles across its various chapters, there aren’t many—but each one can be an endeavor to track down (and a nightmare).</p>



<p>If you’re having trouble with so much as one collectible Doll in Chapter 1’s Necropolis, we’re here to help.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dolls-in-necropolis-chapter-1-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Dolls in Necropolis Chapter 1 in Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We did it, and so can you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five collectible Dolls to find in Little Nightmare 3’s first chapter—Necropolis.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly easy start to Doll collecting in the game. A couple are handed to you on a silver platter, but the others are very missable if you don’t know where to look in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-1-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 1 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Doll number one is <em>unmissable</em>. Proceed through Necropolis and travel through the long, dusty desert. Eventually, you climb a huge ladder that takes a long time to climb. Once you reach the top, crawl through the tunnel, break through the wall, and the Doll is there out in the open in the middle of the floor.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-2-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 2 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Second Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The next Doll requires you to carry on as normal until you reach the point where Low and Alone fall into a giant room—behind a helter skelter-like pillar—and the giant baby monster appears and leers into the room. Move between the statues; both of you need to trigger the floor switch, and an elevator takes you all the way down. Instead of going right through the hole in the door, <strong>use Alone’s wrench to break down the wall to the left</strong>. The Doll is in the middle of this secret room.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-3-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 3 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t miss the third Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>After a section where you <strong>climb up a large wall of broken wooden planks, shimmying from side to side</strong> occasionally, you reach a market area at the top. Go right, and instead of using your umbrella to ride the vertical breeze to the platform, instead, go up the exposed staircase. The third Doll is at the top, next to a wicker basket.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-4-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 4 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The fourth Doll in a dark room. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Doll number four is available after we go through <strong>Low’s cutscene, where they’re in a prison-like room, unmasked, and hiding under the bed</strong>. When Low and Alone come to, go left, crouch through the hole in the broken door, and the fourth Doll is in the room—this one is easily missable because you’d think to go right as the game hints at.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-5-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 5 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The sneaky fifth Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our fifth and final Doll is toward the end of the level. <strong>You must complete a sequence in a bell tower where you smash the head of a statue, and use the bow to cut the rope and ring the bell</strong>—summoning the baby monster. Hide in the box, and once it grabs the bell and leaves, exit through the window to the right. Now, complete the mini umbrella and ladder puzzle, and proceed. You will reach a section where you use the umbrellas to ride across a gap and then pull the plank off the bottom of a door. Climb through and into the alley. Head up the path, and instead of turning right into the opening, carry on going forward, and the final Doll is sneakily hidden away at the end of the passage on the left.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Little Nightmares 3 trophy and achievement list has as much aura and mystery as the whole game. Supermassive Games has whipped up a truly confusing trophy and achievement list that will have you thinking more than twice about each one. Let’s check out how many there are and their descriptions.</p>



<p>It’s apt that a horror game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—shrouded in mystery and shadows—clouds its own trophy and achievement list with unclear descriptions. You’ll be scratching your head over the majority of the trophies in this fairly extensive list.</p>



<p>The Little Nightmares 3 trophies and achievements list is a curious one.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-achievements-amp-trophies">All Little Nightmares 3 Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hang in there. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>Usually, we give you a quick rundown of what you need to do for a trophy list. The <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> list doesn’t specifically mention completing chapters or activities. However, we’ve earned a lot for ourselves—because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming was able to review the game</a> fully before launch—and can tell you some will be earned without you realizing.</p>



<p>So, let’s cut the chatter and get straight into the Little Nightmares 3 trophies and achievements list.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mastery of The Spiral</td><td data-align="center">Keep on turning</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Child’s Play</td><td data-align="center">You’re not rattled that easily</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Unsupervised&nbsp;</td><td data-align="center">Survived the most pressing of situations</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Showstoppers</td><td data-align="center">The show cannot go on</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Spiral Out</td><td data-align="center">A twisted mind unraveled</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Low-Spirited</td><td data-align="center">The real memories are the friend you made along the way</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">From Nowhere, With Love</td><td data-align="center">…But to be is to have been</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Special Connection</td><td data-align="center">There is no bond as strong as this</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Toybox</td><td data-align="center">Playtime’s over now</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Candy Shop</td><td data-align="center">Sweets for my sweet</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Token Gestures</td><td data-align="center">You hit the jackpot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Filed Away</td><td data-align="center">Nothing left in the medicine cabinet</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Loose Threads</td><td data-align="center">Little shapes of big things to come</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hello?</td><td data-align="center">You can always call on me</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Guiding Hands</td><td data-align="center">We’re connected, you and I</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Spanner in the Works</td><td data-align="center">I can be quite handy when I want to be</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bullseye</td><td data-align="center">You gotta aim high</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Peekaboo</td><td data-align="center">There’s a twinkle in that eye</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Windy City</td><td data-align="center">Just don’t open it indoors</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Birdbrained</td><td data-align="center">Always ruffling feathers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Capital Punishment</td><td data-align="center">You’re heading for a shock</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Home Sweet Home</td><td data-align="center">Ready or not, here I come</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stay Tuned</td><td data-align="center">Are you taking notes?</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Light or Flight</td><td data-align="center">Look on the bright side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Another One in the Bag</td><td data-align="center">Nothung but net(profits)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Unsavory Delicacies</td><td data-align="center">Rotting from the inside, delicious on the outside.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Omnipresence</td><td data-align="center">Far or near, she can make us fear</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Delivery Feed</td><td data-align="center">From store to (cage) door</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aim Low (and Alone)</td><td data-align="center">Win a prize every time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Illuminating Experiences</td><td data-align="center">The gift of second sight</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Institutionalized</td><td data-align="center">The Kids Aren’t Alright</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hand-Eye Coordination</td><td data-align="center">You’ve stayed at arm’s length</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 has 32 PlayStation Trophies, which means it has 31 Xbox Achievements—with the PlayStation Platinum Trophy proving to be the difference between the two as standard.</strong></p>



<p>The trophy list is divided into the following quantities and rarities: 1 Platinum Trophy,&nbsp;4 Gold Trophies,&nbsp;16 Silver Trophies, and 11 Bronze Trophies. It’s a healthy distribution with plenty of firepower to add to your overall trophy player level!</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not the biggest trophy list in the world, but it might be one of the most confusing. You might need a helping hand along the way, but the Little Nightmares 3 trophy list will be a satisfying Platinum Trophy or full bundle of Gamerscore. Flex on everyone via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> once you finally achieve this.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-little-nightmares-3-game-length-explained.1321495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Supermassive Games has gotten its hands on the Little Nightmares franchise. The studio brings a wealth of experience to one of the most niche yet beloved indie horror franchises. That said, we’re giving you information on how long the game is based on our experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmare 3</a> is finally out. The transition from Tarsier Studios to Supermassive Games may have caused the game to take longer than thought. However, the new developer isn’t actually new, and has built up a reputation in the horror genre—highlighting titles like Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology as fine examples.</p>



<p>The third game oozes quality—which we can testify to, thanks to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—so let’s see how much there is to enjoy.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-little-nightmares-3">How Many Hours to Beat Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid ride. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>By the time we rolled the Little Nightmares 3 credits, the PlayStation home screen indicated that we had spent at least 7 hours playing the game, but it might be closer to 8 hours, to be safe.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a PS5 owner, you’ll know that when you highlight a game on the home menu screen, there are two indicators on the screen: One indicating playtime and one showing main story progress. When we wrapped up our first playthrough, the home menu was showing 7 hours.</p>



<p>However, this figure doesn’t always seem 100% accurate, based on previous games we’ve played. <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> doesn’t show your playtime in any of the save file slots.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s PR did tell us: “We’d expect a playthrough to come in at under 10 hours!”</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-little-nightmares-3-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Little Nightmares 3 Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>To get every collectible and even get all of the Little Nightmares 3 trophies, you’re probably looking at anywhere between 10-15 hours—depending on how you approach the game.</strong></p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 has an obscure and lengthy trophy and achievement list. If you go into this without a trophy guide at the ready, you could spend a while figuring everything out. Furthermore, each of the four main chapters has a set amount of collectibles. Again, without guidance, it’s going to eat up your time replaying chapters.</p>



<p>Depending on your approach, we’d say that if you use guides to assist you, 10-15 hours sounds about right. If you insist on doing everything yourself and figuring out trophies on your own, you could be looking at even greater game length numbers!</p>

<p>If you saw the post-credits scene in the original movie, this probably shouldn't come as a surprise. The first movie starred Jack Black as Steve, who was joined by Jason Momoa and a crew of misfits, tasked with saving the Overworld from the Piglin invasion.</p>
<p>A promotional shot has also been shared alongside this announcement, which shows two pickaxe with a purple glow. This has already led to speculation about <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_End_(biome)">The End biome</a>, and everything related to it. Jason Hess is also <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/minecraft-2-movie-officially-in-the-works-set-for-summer-2027-release/">confirmed to be heading back</a> to the mines to direct.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wznjtu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>When the first film made its debut in cinemas earlier this year, it was positively received and ended up becoming a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-box-office-success-1236362729/">major box office success</a>. While it's admittedly no cinematic masterpiece, this comedic live-action fantasy adventure does a great job <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/video-minecraft-movie-exclusive-insight-shows-off-the-live-action-crafting-table">recreating the world of Minecraft</a> with all sorts of lore and references to the hugely popular crafting and survival video game.</p>
<p>Mojang even released some free DLC and as well as an in-game event inspired by various "iconic scenes" from the movie.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gamezone-video-game-journalism-reviews-archives</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamezone-a-website-dating-back-to-1994-has-had-its-archives-wiped.1321456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Old heads or students of games media might remember a site called GameZone, which while never a titan in the industry had managed to survive in one way or another since 1994, enjoying various periods of success throughout, which is an <em>incredible</em> achievement in such a volatile field. Sadly in recent months it appears to have been all but killed off by its owners, with archives spanning decades wiped in favour of front page content that doesn’t feel like it was written by or for human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite appearing long dormant--its featured content for most of 2025, like a PS5 review, was years out of date, its<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gamezone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Facebook page hasn't posted since January 2024</a> and its<a href="https://www.youtube.com/GAMEZONE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> YouTube channel hadn't been updated since 2019</a>--in the early months of this year users could still visit GameZone and access decades of older features and reviews. One of the oldest articles I could find a link for via the Wayback Machine was a review for <em>Tiberian Sun</em>, which came out in 1999!</p><figure><figcaption>A snapshot of what GameZone looked like in 2005</figcaption></figure><p>This continuity wasn't just a legacy archive for a long-running site and for games media in general, but was also a way for games writers and those who have since moved to other positions in the media and games industries to link back to their old work. If you go searching through the footnotes of Wikipedia, especially for articles on older games, you'll often find GameZone mentioned, whether it's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam:_Fight_for_NY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Def Jam: Fight for NY</em></a> or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Hit_%26_Run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em></a>.</p><p>Luckily those Wikipedia links point to archived copies of those articles, because GameZone's own backlinks are now dead. With the site having been redesigned in the last few months, GameZone has removed the ability to search the site, and its archives now only contain 12 stories, some of which feature AI-generated imagery (like the example below), and many of which are bylined by Javier Lassus, who is a "Solutions Engineer" and web developer at a company called Playwire. Other posts have Louis Barbati's byline, who is also a "Solutions Engineer" at Playwire, and another whose resume has a lot of customer service and web development on it. If someone told me all their posts--with their bullet points, generic text and rambling on about unrelated topics--had also been written by AI, I would not raise either of my eyebrows.</p><p>(I contacted Playwire for comment on this but at time of publishing have not heard back.)</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gabe brought to my attention that GameZone, the website I wrote at for five years and became Editor-in-Chief of, has seemingly erased every article ever written for the site.</p><p>This includes thousands of news articles, reviews, rare interviews, and features I wrote. <a href="https://t.co/JFqPDt1vtK">https://t.co/JFqPDt1vtK</a></p></div>— Cade Onder (@Cade_Onder) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cade_Onder/status/1972424612974903752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>I spoke to Gabe Reisinger, a former writer for GameZone, and Cade Onder, its last functional EIC who departed in late 2020, and neither of them say they were given even a courtesy heads-up that years of their work was going to be deleted by the site's owners.</p><p>Playwire,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-coo-for-playwire-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the company that has owned GameZone for years</a>, isn't really a traditional media publisher; they're an ad company, and recently<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7255204402938966017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> celebrated inking a sales deal with the Gamurs network</a>, a<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> group of websites we have covered a few times before</a>. Having left the site (Facebook page aside) long dormant, it’s unclear why Playwire decided to reboot it now, at a time when<a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the prospects for games media websites are as dire as they've ever been</a>, even if the plan is to juice stuff via things like SEO.</p><figure><figcaption>A snapshot of what GameZone looks like in October 2025</figcaption></figure><p>The redesigned site still boasts of its 1994 heritage at the foot of the front page, saying:</p><blockquote><p>Founded in 1994, GameZone has been working to bring gamers everything there is to know about the games industry, from reviews on the latest game releases to breaking news and rumors. In addition to gaming, we bring relevant culture and entertainment news.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>But when I contacted the email tips line right next to that text to ask about the redesign and its content, the email bounced back with an "Address not found" error.</p><p>Look, GameZone wasn't a relevant games media resource in 2025. It hadn't been meaningfully updated in years, and seemed to exist solely to juice some social media accounts with large legacy followings and as an archive for 30 years’ worth of video game journalism. But that last point was important! This is history, of the industry and the medium and of all the work everyone who wrote for GameZone since 1994 had put in, and to have it all just deleted like that without notice doesn't just suck, it should--<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I've said before</a>--be something that has some consequences.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gamezone-video-game-journalism-reviews-archives]]></content:encoded>

Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII Remastered are being released together in a “twin-pack” box, while Final Fantasy IX will have a box all its own. All of the games feature some modern conveniences that weren’t available in their initial release. They cost $39.99 each and are now available for preorder at various retailers.</p><p id="final-fantasy-9-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy 9 (Switch)">Final Fantasy IX</h2></p><p id="final-fantasy-7-8-remastered"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy 7 &amp; 8 Remastered ">Final Fantasy VII &amp; VIII Remastered Twin Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="0493e958-f62a-434f-b66f-21a8c2137182" id="229385"><div id="229385" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy 7 &amp; 8 Remastered Twin Pack</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd16?object_uuid=7c2b4a9f-e2be-439b-802d-47e3217b418d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FVGBTNHF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8DpB?object_uuid=7c2b4a9f-e2be-439b-802d-47e3217b418d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at SE Store</a> - $39.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-final-fantasy-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order">already available on Switch</a> (and other platforms) in digital form. But this is the first time they’ll be available in the US in physical form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII was a major release in 1997, and was the first time the series debuted on a non-Nintendo platform. It follows former SOLDIER Cloud Strife as he and a team of freedom fighters battle against the evil Shinra corporation. This version of the game features 3x speed mode, the ability to turn off random encounters, and “battle enhancement mode.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VIII Remastered is an enhanced version of a game that hit the PS1 in 1999. It follows Squall and the rest of the members of SeeD as they fight back against the sorceress Edea, who’s causing quite the global ruckus. This version of the game has various battle assist options, a 3x speed boost, and the ability to turn off random encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of its initial release in 2000, Final Fantasy IX was something of a throwback to the medieval-settings settings of the first six entries in the series. This game follows Zidane and a troupe of actors, who “kidnap” Princess Garnet, who secretly wanted to be kidnapped to get away from her deranged mother, the queen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The visuals have been gently revamped to look better on modern displays. It has other new features as well, including auto-save and seven game boosters, including high speed and no-encounter modes.</p></div><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical-deluxe-edition-where-to-buy">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Physical Deluxe Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-8-and-9-physical-editions-for-switch-are-up-for-preorder-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 9 (Switch) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-where-to-buy">Hades 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-where-to-buy">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-where-to-buy">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy">Nioh 3 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/100-meters-is-a-soulful-gem-about-the-poetry-of-running.1321411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades, anime has routinely spun athleticism into artistic spectacle, be it ping pong duels, basketball games, or wacky, high-octane races that blur the line between vehicular sport and myth. <em>100 Meters</em>, the latest theatrical release from GKids and Studio <a href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock’N Roll Mountain</a>, doesn’t chase flash. Adapted from Uoto’s manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Meters_(manga)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hyakuemo</em></a>, this rotoscoped-driven gem trades bombast for breadth, offering a quietly powerful and inspiring view of an athlete's ambition fighting underneath the pitfalls of competition, burnout, and career-threatening injury.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core are Togashi, a prodigy whose speed and natural-born athleticism feel God-sent, and Komiya, a scrappy underdog fueled by grit alone. Their friendship-turned-rivalry unfolds across years, framed not by medals or podium envy but by a single refrained question: Why do you run? While the film explicitly answers this question, it never feels like it needs to. It's evident in the way the characters’ bodies move—whether they’re leading the pack, trailing behind chasing glory, or simply chasing each other.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="劇場アニメ『ひゃくえむ。』本編冒頭映像６分特別公開！【大ヒット上映中】" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObspfdX4jGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a>, <em>100 Meters</em> scratches the itch of watching two people from wildly different walks of life wrestle with maintaining their passion. But where Tatsuki Fujimoto’s work spirals into grief and artistic obsession, <em>100 Meters</em> stays grounded in the purity of the 100-meter dash, a brutally simple sport where runners have just ten seconds to prove they’re the fastest and etch their name into history. If someone’s a hair quicker, or your body fails you, you’re forgotten in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Although <em>100 Meters</em> flirts with the ephemeral glory of being the best in a sport predicated on “who’s on top right now” over who once was, it never wallows in the futility of the Sisyphean pursuit of greatness. Even in its most agonizing defeats and major setbacks, it refuses to become grim. Instead, it finds beauty in the act of picking yourself back up and starting again—to compete not for legacy, but for love. For the joy of movement, and to run shoulder to shoulder with the like-minded people beside you.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes <em>100 Meters</em> truly magnificent is how, despite being about track and field, it refuses to embellish or exaggerate its modest place in sports. The stands aren’t packed; races aren’t roared over outside of the confines of its niche fandom. The sport isn’t the celestial body around which the universe revolves. It’s just something that <em>100 Meters</em>’ characters collectively chose.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visually, <em>100 Meters’</em> rotoscope animation—arguably the biggest selling point— is sublime. With herculean production feats like a three-minute and 40-second one-shot long take totaling <a href="https://x.com/ROCKNROLL_MT/status/1970718588081189235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approximately 9,830 animation cels</a> across foreground and background layers, Rock’N Roll’s craftsmanship is undeniable. But its rotoscoping truly sings in the film’s quieter moments. Subtle gestures, flickers of emotion, and the rhythmic ebb and flow of movement—both in anguish and elation—are illustrated with painterly grace.&nbsp;</p><p>Complementing this is the film’s soft watercolor background art, where every brushstroke and stain evokes the cozy tactility of a Little Golden Book, tying its visual poetry together with warmth and texture. A texture that erupts from the frame with rapturous adrenaline as its ensemble hits its eighth gear, diving headlong into their runner’s high to finish out strong with primal ferocity.&nbsp;</p><p><em>100 Meters</em> doesn’t grandstand. It just runs. And in doing so, it discovers something achingly beautiful and universal in the blur of its poetry.</p><hr><p><em>100 Meters hits</em> select theaters on October 10 and will be available nationwide from October 12 to October 14.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Great news if you're looking to complete your collection of physical Final Fantasy releases on Switch--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGBTNHF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX</a> Switch physical editions are finally launching in North America. These originally launched in Japan and Europe a few years ago, but US fans were stuck with digital versions on the eShop. While you could import and play the physical versions from other regions thanks to the Switch's region-free hardware, these new US releases will (hopefully) be easier to find when they launch on December 9. Preorders for both games are now live at Amazon for $40 each. While there are no preorder bonuses announced at this time, it's still worth securing early copies, since physical Final Fantasy Switch releases tend to be very popular.</p><p dir="ltr">All three games offer the same core experience as the original PS1 RPGs, but with HD graphics and higher resolution presentation. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered in particular features new character models that are more detailed than the PS1's--though they still resemble the PS1's 3D models' art direction, and use the original animations, so it's not a <em>huge</em> change. All three games also feature optional toggles to turn off random encounters, make your characters invincible, and more. While these are Switch games, you can of course play them on Switch 2 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">With these new Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack and Final Fantasy IX physical releases, it's now possible to grab physical editions of almost every mainline Final Fantasy game--plus some of its best spinoffs--on Switch. The first six entries in the series are all included in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</a>, and the Switch version is on sale for $69 (was $75). Though if you're looking for the best deal, it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also available on PS4</a> for just $53. The pixel remaster versions of these games maintain the classic 2D gameplay of the NES and SNES RPGs, but feature new pixel art (and not the ugly redrawn sprites of the mobile re-releases from a few years ago), as well as other tweaks like the ability to play with the original chiptune soundtracks or new orchestrated versions, optional battle speed and difficulty settings, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For the later entries in the series, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster</a>, which includes Final Fantasy X and its sequel, Final Fantasy X-2. These versions feature upscaled graphics, orchestrated soundtracks, and the extra content from the International Editions of both games, including the roguelike mystery dungeon-style bonus game FFX-2: Last Mission. The CG short Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm--which bridges X and X-2--and the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will are also included in the collection. The Switch edition is on sale for just $25 (was $50).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is available on Nintendo's handhelds via the Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age edition. This re-release of the PS2 RPG includes similar features as many of the other Final Fantasy remasters, including upscaled graphics, a re-recorded soundtrack, and battlespeed modifiers, plus all the bonus content and gameplay changes from the PS2's International Edition that was left out of the US release--including the excellent new Job System that adds welcome variety to how you build your party. You can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age on Switch</a> for $25 (was $50). Both Final Fantasy X/X2 HD and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age are being sold and shipped by Amazon, which we assume means Square Enix recently reprinted both games, since previously it was only available from third-party sellers. It's also surprising that both games are just $25, given that the eShop versions are $50 each.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, the fictional world created by the beloved spin-off, Final Fantasy Tactics, which recently saw its own high-quality remaster in the form of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>. This version includes the option to play with the original PS1 graphics, or the newly remastered version with higher resolution graphics, voice-acted dialog, an overhauled UI, and other changes. The Switch version is available in a $50 Amazon-exclusive physical edition that includes the game and a bonus fold-out poster, as well as a free Switch 2 Upgrade.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Physical Final Fantasy Switch and Switch 2 Games</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Switch)</a> -- $69 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX HD (Switch)</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Amazon Exclusive Edition (Switch)</a> -- $50 | Switch 2 upgrade included</li></ul><p dir="ltr">That leaves Final Fantasy XI Online, Final Fantasy XIV Online, the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, Final Fantasy XV, and Final Fantasy XVI as the last numbered entries in the series not playable on Nintendo's handhelds. We wouldn't be surprised to see most of those show up on Switch 2 eventually (except for FFXI Online since it's a 20-year-old MMORPG that is only playable on PC these days)--though if you're looking to play a version of XV on Nintendo's handhelds, the Final Fantasy XV Mobile version--which is an episodic reimagining that heavily chops down the original PS4 open-world RPG and features a cartoonish art style--is available on the eShop. You'll also find other Final Fantasy spin-offs like World of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles HD, and Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon on the eShop as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the Switch 2 still has some big Final Fantasy releases headed its way. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXHSWXS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade</a> launches on Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and preorders are available for $50 at Amazon.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-campaign-charges-kickstarter-raising-over-400k</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few short days ago, Epictellers launched a Kickstarter campaign for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>. The campaign promises an in-depth cRPG videogame adaptation of Paizo's spacefaring TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Starfinder</em></a>. A project that is off to a strong start, raising over $400,000.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> is an exciting turn-based, narrative-rich, RPG set in the world of Starfinder. The game will center on your custom character and the crew of your own spaceship as you explore the Pact Worlds. The game will feature branching narratives based on your choices, romanceable crew members, and a 40+ hour main story experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=-j5qec7z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=aRmoxMLa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That is quite a lot of material to promise for a Kickstarter. But, the campaign prefaces this by stating the game has been in development for a while. It has already spent a year in pre-production, onboarding developers and voice-actors. Additionally, a development pipeline is in place, with the game set to release in Early Access at the start of 2026, followed by a full release in 2027.</p>

<p>As for the voice-actors confirmed for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, they contain some fantastic industry staples. Big names like Fred Tatasciore, Carolina Ravassa, and Imel Tomlinson are confirmed as major crewmates. But the biggest head turner is the inclusion of voice-actor and voice director of the game is Neil Newbon, most well known for the roguish vampire Astarion in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A second major selling point for the game is on the gameplay side. The game would not just be a turn-based RPG, but one built on the ruleset and mechanics of <em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-crewmate-artwork.jpg?itok=IsxjHF-M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-crewmate-artwork.jpg?itok=TYQpbA71 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With both of these selling points in mind, it is clear that <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> is following in the steps of Larian Studios' masterpiece. While other games like Owlcat's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> have done well, this is the first time a game has tried to adapt Paizo's system into a videogame.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Akitonian Merchant for $41:</strong> A digital PC copy of the game (Steam), special Akitonian in-game dice, and Kickstarter-exclusive digital wallpaper</li>
	<li><strong>Member of the Starfinder Society for $70:</strong> A digital PC copy of the game (Steam), special in-game Starfinder Society items, a digital art book and soundtrack</li>
	<li><strong>Khali's Crew for $105:</strong> Everything in the Member of the Starfinder Society tier, and Khali's Dawn in-game items, and closed beta access</li>
	<li><strong>Complete Edition for $175:</strong> Everything in the Khali's Crew tier, STL files for companions and villains, sacred larva in-game dice, and PDFs of Starfinder Second Edition&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> has raised&nbsp;$444,016, more than five times its initial funding goal of $<span><span><span>87,336. This has unlocked several stretch goals for the project, which include new playable ancestries like the Skittermander and Pahtras, as well as full voice-acting for all sidequests. The campaign ends on November 8.</span></span></span></p>

He lacks any superpowers, so it’s hard to imagine him lasting more than a blink of an eye against the likes of Omni-Man and co. But Invincible creator Robert Kirkman was adamant Cecil be in the game, and left it to the developers at Quarter Up to figure out how to make him work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their answer is to lean on all the cool gadgets we see Cecil use in Invincible, which in this 3v3 tag fighting game levels the playing field somewhat. But there’s more: Invincible VS has a sizeable Story Mode in which Cecil plays a crucial role. Kirkman and Quarter Up won’t say much about it, but they describe is as a “playable episode,” so expectations are high.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview with IGN, Kirkman, Invincible VS executive producer Mike Willette, art director Dan Eder, and narrative director Mike Rogers, talk as much about Story Mode as they are allowed to right now, and delve deep into how Cecil actually works in the game. Read on to find out if Invincible VS is canon to the show, details on Cecil's kit, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It must have been an interesting challenge with Cecil. He doesn’t have any superpowers, but he’s smart and can teleport and uses a lot of weapons. So how did you go about making him work in a fighting game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> From a lore and narrative perspective, Cecil's always in control. We often see him as the man in the ear or the man watching the screen, but people forget that he's a trained agent. He knows how to get his hands dirty and he's got all the tech and all the money of the U.S. government behind him that can allow him to do that. There's just a lot of cool things that we've got in there that allow Cecil to be a really different character. We wanted him in there. There was no way we wanted to exclude him. And we saw opportunities like using his teleporter, like using Reanimen, like using The White Room, to get him in there in a unique way that people might not expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> From a gameplay perspective, you have all these different types of archetypes, and where Cecil really fits in, in a really unique fashion in our system, is manipulating space, almost like he manipulates people, right? So the ability to put out projectiles like his Sonic Mine, that will basically just hover in space and then detonate after a few seconds. So he can put hazards, put roadblocks, put almost like a bullet hell for the opponent to try to get through. And because of our active tag system, he connects one time, he can tag in one of his assists. And so he's got a lot of utility for just manipulating the screen, getting around it, pelting the opponent from afar, making it frustrating for them, and then putting him back into our combo system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So is he a zoner, would you say?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So his combo structure, while he does have auto combos like most of our characters, and the magic chain of light, mediums and heavies, he has a lot of utility for the mid and the long range. He can make people try to chase him down. He has a lot of boosted moves that can cause pop-up or hard knockdown. Or for his… we call it Shellhock, he goes down with a Flaxan weapon and he basically launches like a grenade, but when you boost it you can launch multiples. You can do it</p><p data-cy="paragraph">while retreating and try to fill the screen and try to just set up roadblocks, so you can kind of like reset and then continue to pelt from afar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So he can manipulate a lot more than other characters can, because he has to use these tools. He doesn't have an air dash. He doesn't have double jumps. He uses the teleportation a lot to make those old bones work.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2197035483-1760010568385.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Robert Kirkman is heavily involved with the development of Invincible VS.

He’s not the obvious choice for a fighting game when you look at the characters in Invincible. I'm sure fans will love that he's in there. Was he a character you were keen to see realized in a fighting game particularly? How did it come to be that he was in the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> His presence in the game is something that's really exciting for me because it shows the versatility of what these guys are trying to accomplish with the game, by having characters that you wouldn't expect and working out how Cecil can be equally matched with all the other people that are coming into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really great the way they're pulling in story elements. There's a lot of character that is intact from the comics and the show that is clear in every frame of these characters. Cecil actually puts his hands in his pockets when he moves backwards, which to me was something that I thought was just absolutely brilliant. And it's just a really fun aspect of the character that's there visually as he's moving around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's definitely a wish list of characters that I wanted in the game. And Cecil was one where I thought it would be really cool and unexpected if he were to show up in the game. Never in a million years did I think they would be able to pull it off and pull it off this well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm gonna tease too much… I'm going to get in trouble, I can't say anything! But I'm very excited about this game!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Cecil Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to ask you about the story and the story mode. I don't know if that's something that you can talk about at this stage, but it'd be great to get some input on the narrative side of things, because I do understand that you're going big on that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> I've been working very closely with Mike Rogers, the narrative lead, and Helen Leigh, who's one of the key writers on the series. She wrote the Adam Eve special episode with me and has done a lot of great episodes for the show. What we're really trying to do is provide an in-game experience that is like watching an episode of the television show. It’s a really cool story that uses the characters in a really exciting and authentic way, and I think goes into some directions that people are really going to be surprised by. There's a lot of unexpected twists and turns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> We wanted it to feel like a playable episode. It's this standalone narrative. In the same vein that the Adam Eve special is like a special episode, this is a special episode, too. And just getting to work with Robert and Helen and really craft something that feels right for the Invincible universe, it's been a real treat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is this canon, or is it like a What If? sort of scenario? I know it's an original story, so it's not something we've seen before. But, you know the fans will wonder how it all ties in with everything. They always do. I mean, I do! So what do we actually have here?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> It definitely fits very neatly into the narrative of the show. There's a tremendous level of care going into making sure that the characters are authentic and that everything works. Internally, there's actually a window where we're like, ‘Yeah, could fit there.’ But, you know, we're not going to talk about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willlette:</strong> Just sit back and enjoy yourself!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/lineup-1760010430186.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Eight characters are now confirmed for Invincible VS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve got Cecil going up against Omni-Man, for example, which on the face of it would be impossible. But as designers of a fighting game, how do you balance everything where that can be a valid matchup, even though you would think that Omni-Man would essentially tear everyone to shreds?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> What's so awesome about just jumping right into this universe, there's so much deep lore and personality with these characters and things to pull from, from like all that comic resource. And then you have the show. And it's kind of the rule of cool, what makes this character and what's really fun for gameplay? And then merging these ideas together. And then you get to see what archetypes do they fit within or it's like, are they rushed down? Are they a grappler, are they strikers? Are they long range? You have this kind of triangle and then you're like, ‘Oh, do they fit more along these two aspects or these two?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then things just naturally start to fall in place, and especially within the meta that we've created of like, it's not just a single character, it's three characters that actually represent your kit. So you get to mix and match all these different things. I want to play pure keep away, or I want to have something that's a little bit more balanced where I do have a big bully who can push the corners and then I support that character with a bunch of ranged or mid-range characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when it comes down to balance, it's really just seeing what's the essence of the character, what belongs in their kit, and then how it works within our omni tag system, how do characters play well with each other or support each other, whether it's through the assist systems and the different types of assists that they can have, or how they naturally tag into each other. You can play almost any character like a point character or have it dedicated for a very specific role. It's really play the way that you want. And again, we're just given this beautiful sandbox by Robert and company that's just like, God, we have so much great source material. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder:</strong> I will say one of the challenges of using an established IP is that you have to find the middle ground between being authentic to the IP but also making a fighting game that's gonna work. If you're authentic to the quote unquote power levels of the show, then that wouldn't be a very satisfying experience because it just wouldn't be very balanced. And if you know anything about fighting games, it’s that balance is key. We do want to allow people to be able to play with their favorite character and not be completely demolished just because the other one is so OP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think as long as you're authentic to the character and there's some sort of plausibility of, okay, that character would use those powers, right? Then I think a lot of it comes down to pure skill of whoever is playing that character. And that's how you stay true to the source material, but also just make it stand on its own. Because I think the reality is that not everyone is going to be intimately familiar with Invincible. We don't want to make this game just for the fans. We want to make this game for people who may not be aware of Invincible, and this would be their starting point. So then that wouldn't matter as much to them. ‘Hey, why is Omni-Man so…’</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> We're gonna turn them into fans, Dan!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder:</strong> Exactly. So I think there's a big opportunity to do our own thing, make the game stand on its own, without relying on the fandom, but also make it very pleasing for the fans. At the end of the day we're gonna have a lot of Easter eggs, we're gonna have a lot of small touches and character moments as much as we can. And I think it's gonna be an all around great experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> And Cecil was a character where we got to think about this also. Every character has a round reset in between rounds of the fight where they fly at each other, their fists smash and like, okay, if Omni-Man's fist is smashing into Cecil's, that's not gonna end well for Cecil, but he's got these Reanimen and can jump in and do that for him. He's got the teleporter that can allow him to dash around, sort of in the way he has a conversation with Nolan at the end of Season 1. And we got to interpret that and bring those into like, how do they work in a fighting game? And I think it brought an extra level of authenticity to the character. And that challenge for a character like Cecil yields more specificity, which is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did all you fighting game developers all over the world get together one day and decide 2026 was going to see the return of tag fighters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> It's the most insane thing — and it's true — that all great minds think alike! Because we haven't seen a really awesome tag battle fighting game since like Dragon Ball Fighterz, and that's like, what? Eight years now. And then before that, the gold standard was Marvel vs. Capcom. So there was this huge void. And we all approached it differently. Our competitors are different from us. And that's actually a really good thing. And it's interesting, everyone has their own take, and we really like our take. We really like the universe that we get to play in, and we like the violence of it, the brutality of the stakes that are involved, and our unique style of combat and what it means to read someone — you read your opponent and be able to have large amounts of counterplay. Yeah, it's an exciting time. 2026 is crazy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was a tag fighter right for you? And then 3v3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> Obviously being a huge fan of the comics in the show, when I was asked like, ‘Hey, Mike,  what game do you want to do?’ I'm like, ‘I want to do an Invincible tag battle fighting game.’ There's so many factions and teams that exist within the universe, whether it's like the Teen Team or The Guardians or The Lizard League or The Order, like there's just so many. And when you watch people fight, like yeah, there's solo fights, but there's also a lot of team fighting that takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been this lack of team fighter games for such a long period of time. And then this IP had lots of strengths when it came to teams and team synergy, and I always thought about the ideas of like, what happens when these characters team up and do shit together? Like when Eve and Mark fight together, how awesome is that? So we just wanted to play out those fantasies, and what better method than in a fighting game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-wanted-it-to-feel-like-a-playable-episode-robert-kirman-and-the-developers-of-invincible-vs-talk-about-its-mysterious-story-mode-and-making-cecil-work-in-a-fighting-game">IGN's interview with Kirkman and the developers at Quarter Up to find out more about how Cecil works and the Invincible VS story mode</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cecil’s announcement means we now know of eight playable characters in Invincible VS, voiced by the actors who play those characters in the hugely popular Prime Video animated series. They are Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Bulletproof, Thula, Rex Splode, Battle Beast, Omni-Man, and now also Cecil.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Cecil:</p><blockquote>A fan-favorite from the Invincible TV series and comic books, Cecil has been one of the most requested playable characters. Most often heard as a voice in Mark’s earpiece, Cecil enters the fight in Invincible VS with specialized weapons, including plasma pistols, projectile launchers and grenades to keep opponents at a distance. His ranged gameplay style is paired with tactical combat, allowing him to play cat and mouse with enemies. Want more? Cecil can also summon a limitless supply of Reanimen for backup; with access to The Hammer — a massive orbital laser — he is a devastating force on the battlefield.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Quarter Up talked more about the Invincible VS Story Mode, which is a standalone narrative set in the Invincible universe. It’s written by Invincible TV show co-executive producer and writer Helen Leigh and Invincible VS narrative director Mike Rogers, in collaboration with Kirkman. Expect over 25 minutes of bespoke animation in the Story Mode, which “plays like a special extended episode of the show,” featuring every announced playable character so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, the Story Mode teases the arrival of a brand-new character who hasn’t yet appeared anywhere in the Invincible Universe. Quarter Up wouldn’t say who, but did confirm Cecil plays a pivotal role in the story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Cecil Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Invincible has always been as much about  compelling storytelling as it is about bloody beatdowns and fights you can’t tear your eyes from,” said Kirkman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was really important to me that we capture the essence of both the comic and television series, and bring key characters into the game. With Story Mode, our hope is that fans feel like they are right back in the show, but experiencing the universe in a whole new way.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible VS will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Players can register for an upcoming Invincible VS Closed Alpha later this year here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>For gamers of a certain age, gibberish character sequences like <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/pageofdoom/cheat.html">idkfa</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/simcity-2000/cheats/">torg</a>, <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/genesis/563332-mortal-kombat/cheats">ABACABB</a>, and <a href="https://konami.fandom.com/wiki/Konami_Code">UUDDLRLRBA</a> are akin to long-lost magical incantations. They evoke an era where game developers frequently and routinely let players use cheat codes to customize their gameplay experience with everything from infinite health and instant level selection to <a href="https://tcrf.net/Help:Contents/Terminology/Debug_Mode">full debug menus</a> or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigHeadMode">gigantic anime-style giant-headed avatars</a>. There were even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/how-the-new-game-genie-lets-you-hack-your-ps3-saves/">external cheat devices</a> that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended.</p>
<p>While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1966521540130009578">announced</a> that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> would include new "streamlined progression" features. As the name implies, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1nlcmn8/streamlined_progression/">new options menu</a> will give players the opportunity to blaze through the game with infinite health, magic, and money, quicker leveling, maximum damage attacks, and more.</p>

<p>While some responded negatively to what they derisively called a "cheat mode," director Naoki Hamaguchi defended the new options <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/">in a recent interview with Automaton</a>. "Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far," he said. "I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That’s why I pushed for it."</p>
<p>He's right. Players are responsible enough to know if, when, and how to use these kinds of options to help streamline their progress through a game. At the same time, I think many games would benefit from hiding these kinds of gameplay-altering options behind the obscurity of old-fashioned cheat codes, rather than tempting built-in menus.</p>

<h2>Developer intent</h2>
<p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is far from the first modern game to offer players a simple option for friction-free progress. In <em>Mass Effect 3</em> it's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/">Narrative Mode</a>. In <em>Nier Automata</em> it's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2016/09/19/nier-automata-auto-mode-lets-the-ai-do-the-fighting-for-you/">Auto Mode</a>. In <em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em> it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/discovery-tour-lets-you-explore-assassins-creed-origins-combat-free/">Discovery Mode</a>. In <em>Death Stranding</em> it's just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/every-game-should-copy-death-strandings-very-easy-mode/">Very Easy Mode</a>. In a game like <em>Celeste</em> it's <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/celeste-difficulty-assist-mode/">a whole menu of accessibility options</a> that allow for fine-tuning of the game's precision platforming rules.</p>
<p>In each case, there's a recognition that some players might want to explore a game's world—to experience the characters, art, and dialogue that the developers worked so hard to craft—without struggling through mechanical reflex tests or grindy, repetitive challenges. Even players who enjoy the "intended" difficulty most of the time might want to treat the game like a giant sandbox on subsequent playthroughs, or quickly skip to their favorite part when revisiting years later.</p>
<p>As Penny Arcade <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2005/05/16/we-are-so-very-proud-of-you">memorably put it back in 2005</a>: "I play games to enter a trance state and experience other lives, [others] play them to defeat the designer of the game by proxy. That’s a significant distinction."</p>
<p>But there are some games where this kind of built-in difficulty manipulation would be antithetical to a game's very nature. In <em>Baby Steps</em> for example, struggling with the game's controls and suffering when you lose significant progress to an errant step <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/baby-steps-is-the-most-gloriously-frustrating-game-ive-ever-struggled-through/">is very much the point</a>.</p>

            <p>
              A "perfect balance" toggle would completely ruin the impact of this <em>Baby Steps</em> moment.

<p>A version of <em>Baby Steps</em> where you could plow through to the end with perfect balance or frequent save points would ruin the experience in some crucial ways. Just offering this kind of "Exploration Mode" in the options menu would undercut the message the developers are trying to impart, giving players an easy out in a game where those don't and shouldn't exist.</p>

<p><em>FF7 Remake</em>'s Hamaguchi acknowledged a similar issue in discussing why he wouldn't initially offer "streamlined progression" options for the upcoming third game in the remake series. "If we were to add it to the third installment at launch, it would probably spark controversy," Hamaguchi said. "We’d risk disrupting the experience for fans who have been waiting the longest and deserve to enjoy it the most (through spoilers coming out early and similar)."</p>
<p>This is where I think the added friction of the old-fashioned cheat code can come in handy. While a tempting "easy mode" menu option can weaken the impact of a game's "intended" design, a hidden cheat code is much more clearly set apart as an unrelated option intended for tinkerers and fun-seekers.</p>

<h2>Making “easy mode” harder to find</h2>
<p>The difference comes down to context. Back in the day, players usually found cheat codes from a source outside of the game itself, passing around the arcane knowledge through online forums, printed magazines, or schoolyard rumors. That outside sourcing made it clear that, while these codes were obviously part of the game in a sense, they were also somehow separate from the core gameplay experience. Even the term "cheat code" connotes the idea that you're getting away with something by evading the game's built-in rules.</p>

<p>An ever-present "god mode" toggle or "accessibility" menu, on the other hand, presents those options as contextually valid and at least somewhat intended ways for different players to experience the same base game. And that's perfectly fine in many cases; as Hamaguchi pointed out, sometimes players will just want to experience the story as quickly as possible. But in games where the difficulty is integral to the developer's intent, putting that kind of option upfront can confuse the message and confuse the player as to which is the most "correct" way to play.</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>Toggling an "easy mode" through a menu is like flipping a light switch that the developers left invitingly available in a little-used corner of the house. Tracking down a cheat code, on the other hand, feels more like going to the hardware store and asking for help to install your own light switch. The effect is the same, but the path to get there makes all the difference.</p>
<p>In modern PC gaming, mods often offer that same kind of context change. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/babysteps/mods/2">This fanmade <em>Baby Steps</em> mod</a> offers the ability to fly to any location and save at any time, completely ruining the game as it was designed. But players that go to the trouble of seeking out, downloading, and installing that mod obviously have no one to blame for that bastardization but themselves.</p>

<p>Cheat codes also offer developers additional options for how and when they present new options to players. In <em>UFO 50</em>, for instance, players can discover many of <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/215407-ufo-50/cheats">the game's gameplay-altering Terminal Codes</a> by beating a subgame and watching the credits. Even outside the game, a developer can keep a cheat code's very existence hidden for months <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/decades-later-players-are-still-unlocking-secrets-in-classic-mortal-kombat/">or even years</a> after a game's launch, ensuring that early adopters experience the game as designed (this happened all the time in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/final-nintendo-power-cover-brings-the-magazine-full-circle/">the pre-Internet era of game magazines</a>).</p>
<p>Trying to bring back that era of hidden knowledge might seem silly in an age where Internet sleuths are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-datamining-has-changed-the-landscape-of-video-game-puzzle-and-secret-design">data-mining games before they even come out</a>. But I still think that a revival of the humble video game cheat code can help offer fun and helpful gameplay options for those who want them while protecting the intent of today's video game designers.</p>

<p>The Ninja Gaiden 4 release is quickly approaching, allowing players to download the game ahead of launch, and the preload and file size are available now.</p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-ninja-gaiden-4-pre-order-bonuses-amp-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-ordered the game</a>, you are just about ready to go, but to make sure you can play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the moment that it’s available</a>, you should get the download out of the way now.</p>



<p>Here is a preload guide for Ninja Gaiden 4 and the pre-launch file size on each platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-ninja-gaiden-4">When Can You Preload Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The wait is almost over. Image by Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Ninja Gaiden 4 are currently available on PC via the Windows Store and Xbox Series X|S. As of this writing, PlayStation 5 and Steam players will have to wait just a little longer before they can start downloading the game.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, we do not have a confirmed date or time that Steam and PlayStation will allow players to start the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng4/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> preload. The release date is set for October 21, so you should expect it to be available any day now.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-file-size-explained">Ninja Gaiden 4 File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>As of pre-launch, the Ninja Gaiden 4 file size sits at 54.9 GB on PC through the Windows Store, 36.82 GB on Xbox Series X, and 23.55 GB on PlayStation 5. Steam players can probably expect a similar file size to the Windows Store version.</strong></p>



<p>As is pretty usual, the file size on PC is larger because the game has to account for a larger variety of hardware that will be running the game, a lot of which is stronger than you see in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. With that said, the PlayStation 5 version being less than half of the PC version is definitely a testament to the compression work in that version.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that these file sizes are for the game ahead of launch. If there is a day-one patch or update, who knows how much the file sizes could jump up.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-ninja-gaiden-4">How to Preload Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>



<p><strong>To preload Ninja Gaiden 4, you will have to pre-order the game digitally through any of the supported platforms. Anyone looking to get the game physically will have to wait until release, when they have the disc in hand.</strong></p>



<p>If you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-ninja-gaiden-4-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order the game now</a>, there should be an option at checkout to start downloading the game immediately. If you have preordered previously, look in your owned games library for the option to start downloading. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> can go to the Game Pass app and search for the game to find the pre-install option.</p>
