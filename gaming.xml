  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Soon after it launched in 2019, Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-disappears-from-steam-after-pooh-review-bombing">pulled from sale</a> following some controversy regarding Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie The Pooh (long story). It was made available for purchase again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">a couple of years later</a>, though it should have been a touch earlier than that as it was promised to be released on GOG late 2020. However, on the same day it was announced to be returning, GOG put out a statement saying they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-back-down-from-re-releasing-devotion">wouldn't be releasing it after all</a>. Now, half a decade on from that, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflects on the decision to not put it up for sale, after it stood by selling the also controversial Horses.
</p>
<p>
"That situation remains difficult to reflect on," Gołębiewski told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-reflects-on-devotion-delisting">Eurogamer</a> in an interview. "At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us."
</p>
<p>
Gołębiewski went on to say that in order to keep a "global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility." 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to a game like Horses, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">banned from sale on Steam supposedly over an outdated scene</a>, he feels that the situation was different, saying that its sale on GOG didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners. There was no other concern driving this decision, just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."
</p><p>
I am not entirely convinced by his reasoning, I have to say. GOG explained that they were pulling Devotion from sale at the time <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817">like so</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Of course, this might have just been the public reason presented at the time, and Gołębiewski is now telling the true version of events, but I find it a bit tough to believe that they hadn't considered the potential business and geopolitical factors up to that point (the game was nearly two years old by this point). Still, better to have at least one storefront that willingly releases games with difficult themes occasionally than not at all, I suppose.

<p>As Nintendo continues to celebrate Milestones like the 40th anniversaries of the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises, key developers from Nintendo’s history are entering the next phases of their lives as well.</p>



<p>Legendary producer Kensuke Tanabe recently announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be his final game at Nintendo. The news was shared in an interview with the Japanese magazine<a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Nintendo Dream</a>, which was later posted on<a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Weibo.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-kensuke-tanabe-confirms-he-s-worked-on-his-last-title-at-nintendo">Kensuke Tanabe Confirms He’s Worked On His Last Title at Nintendo</h2>



<p>As <span>reported by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>Vi</span>deo Games Chronicle</a>, Tanabe confirmed that he will no longer be involved in the studio’s production, but trusts that Risa Tabata and the team at Retro Studios will be able to continue moving forward should that be what Nintendo requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Completing this game took far longer than anticipated… Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.</p>



<p>It’s been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t set out to create anything ‘special’ because of this. Instead, we worked closely with Retro Studios, just as we always have with Nintendo projects, aiming to deliver a fun and unique experience for players of all ages and playstyles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Following news about Tanabe, it was also confirmed that Hideki Konno, known for launching the Mario Kart franchise, left the studio in July 2025. </p>



<p>The news was confirmed via his private Facebook account. He received a special thanks credit in the recent Mario Kart World release and last worked on the Mario Kart 8: Deluxe DLC for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>







<p>Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind the Mario and Zelda franchises, remains on board at Nintendo. Currently, he has been working closely with Universal on the release of the Super Mario Bros. movies. The forthcoming Super Mario Galaxy movie is due to release in April 2026. A Nintendo Direct will reveal new information about the movie on January 25.

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio has commented on the mindset and strategy behind XGS-produced games landing on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>The days of the console wars of the 2000s, pitting Xbox, Nintendo, and Sony consoles against each other, have come and gone. These days, the Xbox team wants players to get behind the idea that everything is an Xbox. As part of the strategy, Xbox’s first-party games are beginning to release on PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Recently, Xbox announced that the forthcoming Fable reboot and Forza Horizon 6 would both be coming to PlayStation 5, with Fable releasing across all consoles on the same day and Forza coming to Xbox platforms in May with a later release on PlayStation.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-discusses-multiplatform-release-strategy">The Head of Xbox Game Studios Discusses Multiplatform Release Strategy</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During the recent interview with Games Radar+,</a> Craig Duncan of XGS stated that his main focus is to ensure as many players as possible get to experience Xbox-produced titles. </p>



<p>When questioned about the consistency of titles across different platforms, Duncan admitted that, while strategies and realities change, they’re aiming to be more consistent with multiplatform releases in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. Like you said, when a strategy changes, maybe you’ve got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can’t. So that’s why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</p>



<p>But you know, for our game makers, if you’re on the Fable team, you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team’s doing. That’s always our goal. It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</p>

            <p>Highguard is set to pull back the curtain with an "in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio" on 26th January, which also just so happens to be the same day the free-to-play live-service hero shooter is expected to launch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qR9Xbzt5t0">"official launch showcase"</a> will reportedly include a "full gameplay deep dive", plus plans for the game's inaugural year and "much more", which is just as well, as we have heard extraordinarily little about the all-new PvP raid shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">since its announcement trailer</a> at last month's The Game Awards, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite buying time to showcase the game at The Game Awards (or maybe because of it?), developer Wildlight Entertainment has shared very little since, which means we're just a few days off from release with just a 180-second reveal trailer to show for it. If it wasn't for the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-shows-signs-of-life-less-than-one-week-away-from-launch">Steam activity has picked up in recent days</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PS5 trophy list</a> has popped up, you'd be forgiven for thinking it had been delayed.</p><p>Hailing from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, Highguard is a PvP raid shooter which will see players "ride, fight, and raid as Wardens". That is to say, "arcane gunslingers" who have been sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Hopefully we'll find out more when the showcase goes live at 6pm UK time on Monday, 26th January.</p>
<p>As for that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PlayStation 5 trophy list for Highguard</a>? There'll be 33 PS5 trophies in total, including Plunderer, which is awarded when a player opens and acquires loot from at least 15 chests in a single match, and Animal Control for eliminating 20 enemy mounts.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">Roguelike</a> deckbuilders! They're everywhere! It's a bit of an epidemic, honestly, sorting the wheat from chaff is a tough job. Of course, once in a while a genuinely novel take on the genre rolls around, and PinKeep has done just that, a pinball game where you change the playfield as you progress through runs. And it's from the devs behind the Far series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a>!
</p>
<p>
The pinball element is likely self explanatory. There's a ball, it gets shot off, and you have two flippers to hit it with, nothing new there. It's everything else around it that'll have you thinking about the beautiful game (in this world the beautiful game is pinball). Runs are split up into different themed stages, and it's up to you to add elements to the main playing field.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, say you want a bumper somewhere on the field to propel your ball along, you choose from the cards you've collected, and place it at various fixed points. You can rotate such structures to your liking, but to play these cards you need to spend money. To get money, you need to use your ball to destroy trees and rocks. Then you collect resources from these destroyed elements of nature, selling them to merchants at the top of the screen, of which you get to by flinging your ball successfully towards them.
</p><p>
This is further complicated by enemies slowly progressing towards your town of operations, and if they manage to reach you, you lose a bit of health. You'd think hitting enemies would be as much a bit of luck as it is skill, but you also have the ability to slow down time and flick your ball anytime you like, allowing you to line it up just so to take down an enemy combatant.
</p>
<p>
All this took some getting used to, with the fast-paced nature of pinball mixed with slowing down to plot out where you want being an interesting tactical exercise. The thing is, I just don't think you can go wrong with pinball, but the way you can build upon it here makes it much more strategic. Take the aforementioned bumper you can add in. It comes with the added effect of a little goblin that sits on top of it who shoots out arrows at incoming arrows if you hit said bumper.
</p>
<p>
When you build up your field just right there's a nice harmony to it all. I do wonder if adding in changes to the slow motion flick or the flippers themselves would add something or overcomplicate things, but as it is in its current demo, PinKeep is heading in the right direction. You can try it out for yourself, or just wishlist it, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4143700">here</a>.

<p>The ARC Raiders Headwinds season launches on Tuesday, January 27, 2026.

This is in addition to other items and general quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team announced the arrival on social media. This is only the first step in the roadmap, which outlines plans for the game through April 2026 and promises even more content for the popular extraction shooter.</p>

<p>Players will still have to wait until April for a new map, expected to be a waterborne map, to arrive in the game, something that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all players are happy about.</a> However, the game has been an overall success, netting over 10 million sales since its release in the latter half of 2025.</p>

            <p>Despite the death threats he faced when first deciding to bring Konami's horror franchise to the big screen, director of the third Silent Hill movie, Return to Silent Hill, would be open to adapting a further game for the big screen.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/features/return-to-silent-hill-director-death-threats-game-fans-1236638923/">Variety</a>, director Christophe Gans said that whilst critics panned 2006's Silent Hill adaptation, "the reputation of the movie has grown", giving him a new audience in the "2.0 generation of Silent Hill lovers" that he hopes to tap into for this new adaptation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>

<p>"If I have the opportunity, we'll come back to Silent Hill once more," he said. "I'm not looking at Silent Hill only as a great video game. I'm looking at it as a piece of modern art. It has something really edgy and experimental. I will adapt another chapter because there are some that are extremely good, something very different from the first film, and now Return to Silent Hill. I like this world, and I can see that plenty of people are thinking I'm doing a pretty good job."</p>
<p>Gans also revealed that when he announced interest in adapting the series for 2006's Silent Hill, he received "plenty" of death threats.</p>
<p>"It was a big challenge to adapt correctly and respectfully a game which is considered a classic," Gans added. "We know that the people who love video games are very passionate. I remember when I did the first film, I received plenty of death threats. People were saying, 'If you mess up this one, we are going to find you.' So I came onto the first film with great responsibility, and certainly even more with the second one. At the same time, it was important for me to imagine a movie that people who are not playing games can be interested in."</p><p>Return to Silent Hill is part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Unfortunately, it's not faring much better than its panned predecessor, Silent Hill Revelation: at the time of writing, it's sitting at 31 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/return-to-silent-hill/">Metacritic</a> (and a 4.4 user score), and 15 on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (30% user score). Admittedly, it's only the end of January, but that makes it the worst-reviewed movie of the year to date on both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/movie/?releaseYearMin=2025&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=20">one of the worst released over the last 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>By comparison, Silent Hill: Revelation has a Metacritic score of 16 (4.5 from users).</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> was never a game that was going to win me over, as I generally only like single-player shooters if any, but it isn't helped by the fact that since its announcement there hasn't been a lick of actual marketing to help it prove itself. This, of course, has been the subject of much discourse, to which I will contribute slightly in the coming paragraphs, but the main point of all this is to say that actually, against all odds, Highguard is in fact sticking to its January 26th launch date, and will even show off some gameplay… on its release day.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a singular Dweet on the game's Dwitter account, explaining the following: "Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase. Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more." You'll note Devolver Digital being its usual cheeky self in the replies asking if the devs need a publisher; "There's still time."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p><p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p><p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p></div>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Now, I don't care to be marketed to, excessively, moderately, or conservatively, the last of which is still generous in Highguard's case. It's just I can't tell if releasing a game after one trailer is an act of supreme hubris, well-placed confidence, or riding on the assumption that it being from the creators of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. I have to wonder if developer Wildlight Entertainment thought that such a pedigree was enough in this pre-established property-led world we live in.
</p>
<p>
Highguard might have some old guard talent, but we don't live in the same world as film, plastering names over trailers of other games doesn't suggest guaranteed quality, it invites comparison. Games have to prove themselves in the pudding, and so far on most counts Highguard hasn't done a very good job of that. The only benefit it currently has is all of this technically bad (absent) PR might make enough people curious enough to play it, and it is free so that's easy enough to do. Guess we'll find out in a week or so!

<p>Maybe in years past, such an intro would fill us with excitement and anticipation; after all, a peek behind the development curtain is always a welcome treat. But in 2026, the line is a signifier of bad news.</p>
<p>Said opening almost always leads to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We've got some news today. As the launch date has approached, it's become clear that [GAME] needs a little more time to bring it to the quality that we want for it and that you deserve. Therefore, we've taken the difficult decision to delay the game until next year.</em><br>

<p>Whether you have a casual interest in the industry or you are the most capital of Capital-G-Gamers, we'd wager that you've seen something like this at least once in the past 12 months. You probably saw a couple in the 12 months before that, too. And the year before that. And th...</p>
<p>Demand for games remains high, but delays seem to be cropping up more in recent years than ever before — heck, remember when Devolver Digital made a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/devolver-will-reveal-all-games-pushed-to-2024-in-next-weeks-devolver-delayed-showcase">'Delayed' showcase</a> back in 2023? No one sub-group of developers or publishers is guiltier than any other, either. Indies and AAA releases alike are pushed from the planned launch to a later date, window or, occasionally, indefinitely. It feels like it's happening <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<h2>'Please Understand' - The Delay Cycle</h2>
<p>To illustrate our point, here are a handful of games we were really looking forward to that got delayed on Switch in the last 12 months alone:</p>

<p>That was just 2025 delays, and without mention of the giant <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA 6</a>-shaped hole in the middle of it all. So, when we say it feels like it's happening everywhere, we really mean it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="f88c54c4dc23f"><a title="Delay Messages" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f88c54c4dc23f/delay-messages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No "Dear Gamers" Cyberpunk 2077 yellow in sight — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get us wrong, we'd much rather that a game is delayed and launches in a good state, than being rushed out with missing features or more serious issues to boot. Our backlogs are long enough already, so hearing that something has been pushed back from a busy season isn't always the worst news. It's just confusing when it happens time and again.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> does it keep happening? The industry is hurting, the COVID-19 pandemic threw everything off, and economic factors obviously hold huge influence over decisions, but there has to be more to it. With <em>so many</em> games being delayed, it surely can't just be a case of unexpected bumps in the road to release, where project managers aren't learning from previous well-publicised mistakes.</p>
<p>"Most often, it stems from teams missing their production goals or not quite reaching the level of quality they want from their project," System Shock 2 producer <strong>Justin Khan</strong> tells us. "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/system-shock-2-suffers-unexpected-delay-on-switch">This delay</a> actually stemmed from our initial desire to upgrade the project from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5 for these ports. We spent several months on this exploration, during which we were unable to successfully deploy to the Switch and Switch 2 [...] With more time, I’m sure we could have made the engine upgrade work and deployed on all platforms, but production time was running short, and so we had to pivot quickly."</p>
<p>Experimentation was a similar time sink in Revolution Software's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>, which landed a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-lands-last-minute-delay-on-switch">last-minute Switch delay</a> back in 2024. "We initially used tools to help upscale and then over-draw," studio co-founder <strong>Charles Cecil</strong> tells us, "[but] we pretty quickly realised that artists recolouring the backgrounds from scratch resulted in a much higher quality than when attempting to use these tools."</p>
<figure data-uuid="48224afc51751"><a title="Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - Reforged" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/48224afc51751/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Sometimes there isn’t a great explanation or nuanced message that could be written that wouldn’t be [better summarised] by a simple 'we need more time'," says Khan.</p>
<p>Sassy Chap Games echoed this sentiment when we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/youve-gotta-make-it-more-sexy-final-fantasy-and-persona-voice-actors-have-made-a-dating-sim-for-everyone">spoke about Date Everything's second delay</a> last year ("It was absolutely a blessing that we had the delay to make sure that everything was ironed out and gone through"), as does <strong>Celia Schilling</strong> of Yacht Club Games' Mina the Hollower. "The team needed more time to apply some final polish and balancing to the game," she says. "We know that indefinite delay announcements can feel scary, especially in the indie scene, so we wanted to explicitly express that this delay wasn’t a major one."</p>
<p>The reason itself vary between projects, naturally, but what remains consistent across many of the dreaded delay messages is a genuine attempt to apologise and convince fans that it'll all be worthwhile in the end. Given the passion of fans and the familiarity of the delay announcement format, it's a difficult message to get right.</p>
<p>"We didn't want to do the big text screen jpeg that everyone shows on social media," Necrosoft's <strong>Brandon Sheffield</strong> says about Demonschool's last-minute delay message. "So we kept the statement short, and just tried to move along. We ignored all the people being mad at us as best we could."</p>
<p>It's easy to suggest that devs should just announce their games closer to release, but very few indie studios have the luxury of near-silence until launch that we see from a Team Cherry or ConcernedApe. For players, though, it's a disheartening experience when months of buzz and trailers leave you excited to play a game at a specific time (over a holiday or long weekend, let's say), only for that prospect to be taken away at the last second.</p>
<p>Rest assured, the developers are similarly disappointed. "In our case, it was a tough decision, but we unanimously agreed it needed to happen", says Schilling. Nightdive's Khan agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Demoralisation is a strong word, but it accurately describes the situation when the team works incredibly hard, pulling long hours to meet an approaching deadline, only for the game to be delayed anyway. In those moments, it can feel like all that effort was for nothing. But the relief sets in quickly knowing that there is now additional time to polish things further and ensure the final product is as high quality as possible."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if a delay needs to happen, that's not to say that the dev necessarily wants it to. Aside from player expectations, which Sheffield describes as a "big worry" in the run-up to a delay announcement, there's also the team itself to think about. Though it can bring relief, a delay can also extend stress even longer.</p>
<p>"Overall I think the delay was good for us, but it did cause a lot of turmoil within the studio, and contributed to burnout, among other things," Sheffield says of Demonschool's second delay. "It was better for the game, and better for us in the long run, but it definitely wasn't fun, we didn't take it lightly, and we hope to not do anything like that again anytime soon!"</p>
<h2>Planning Problems vs. Outside Influence</h2>
<p>Nobody wants a delay to happen, so do we have to question the practice of choosing an initial release date instead? If devs know that bumps, experimentation, and polish time are likely, why pick a release date that underestimates them? At this point, surely there's enough project timeline data on the causes of delays to suggest that no, you're probably not going to hit that November launch.</p>
<p>For Nightdive, System Shock 2's release date "was forecasted by doing some optimistic time horizon math," with specific weekly targets that the team needed to hit to remain on track. For Yacht Club, it was based on how the game had performed at SteamNext Fest and SGF. Plus, "Halloween felt fitting, and it lined up perfectly with our plans."</p>
<figure data-uuid="25e4947969b82"><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25e4947969b82/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's certainly an element of better scheduling practices needed. A delay by a couple of days/weeks/months is understandable, but what were you thinking with the original date otherwise?</p>
<p>Other bumps in the road can affect plans, too. Nintendo's eShop certification process is a long one (if you can believe it, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">some of the titles</a> that end up on there), and we've heard of several developers getting caught in the bottleneck and missing their launch because they didn't have the final copy ready for Nintendo's approval in time — "a minimum of 30 days before your release date," according to Khan. It's a similar story told by Wadjet Eye Games' Dave Gilbert last year, when Nintendo's "frustrating" cert process meant the point-and-click adventure game Old Skies was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/frustrating-nintendo-cert-process-causes-last-minute-switch-delay-for-old-skies">delayed at the eleventh hour</a> despite being submitted months before.</p>
<p>Such problems are multiplied on the physical front. Bitmap Bureau <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/terminator-2d-no-fate-has-been-delayed-on-all-consoles">pushed Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> from its initial launch date three times due to "ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions". It's difficult to block out release windows when cart production and supply chain problems are out of your control.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there's the big issue that very few studios want to discuss outright: budget. Aside from being demoralising, a delay is an expensive affair, often requiring months' worth of extra funds from <em>somewhere</em> to get across the finish line.</p>
<p>"Previously, the ‘waterfall’ approach favoured by publishers locked scope, time, and cost into a rigid contract," Cecil says. "If any aspect of the work required was underestimated, then the only variable that could be cut back would be quality."</p>
<p>The nature of post-launch updates, promised fixes, and DLC down the line means things are slightly different these days, but a game's initial budget still usually dictates when work on a project must end. After all, how can you keep tweaking when all the funds have dried up?</p>
<figure data-uuid="6e2d82a902bc0"><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e2d82a902bc0/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Schilling says she's confident Yacht Club's "financial runway is still there" for Mina, she admits that the team "had to make our operations costs stretch and cut back on expenses like our office space." A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> report last year confirmed that the studio planned to be fully remote by 2026. Likewise, Broken Sword's delay "pushed our finances to the limit," says Cecil, with the project relying on Kickstarter support to "achieve our desired level of ambition."</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are occasions where a delay sees the publisher pick up the slack, as was the case for Demonschool: "Basically if our publisher hadn't kindly decided to fund us during that delay it would've been impossible. So thanks to Ysbryd for that!"</p>
<p>Live service models aside, it seems clear that launch for many titles is increasingly a necessity to get some money rolling in so that post-launch development can continue - a form of Early Access without the label, essentially. If everything has been squeezed dry and the project <em>still</em> isn't up to snuff, what option do you have?</p>
<p>Of course, big players like Nintendo can silently sit on games for months before launch, but that's a huge anomaly in the industry at large. (Yes, before you say it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> is certainly an outlier.) In retrospect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s delay felt as much a question of picking the perfect launch window for the marketing campaign as it did the game needing extra time in the oven.</p>
<p>And what about, after all that planning, something else comes along to disrupt the waters? Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Silksong</a>'s surprise launch a mere two weeks after its long-anticipated release date announcement, the likes of Demonschool and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baby_steps">Baby Steps</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">were pushed back</a> to escape the blast radius.</p>
<p>"We had a special case in that 100% of the reason we delayed Demonschool was because Silksong announced it was releasing the day after us," Sheffield tells us. "We knew we couldn't compete with them for attention, so we were forced to delay."</p>
<h2>'Thank You For Your Patience' - What's The Answer?</h2>
<p>It's a multi-pronged problem, then. It would be easy to sit here and say that a delay could have been avoided with better planning at the jump, but certification woes, economic troubles, and budgetary constraints aren't as easily predicted as 'we might need more time to test XYZ'.</p>
<p>Not making an announcement until everything is set in stone feels like an obvious fix, but you need a <em>lot</em> of established street cred — and money in the bank — to pull off a shadow drop, and the marketing train has got to leave the station early if you're a small to mid-sized dev and you want your roguelike deckbuilder to stand out in the crowd.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a78b658c45f9a"><a title="Delayed Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a78b658c45f9a/delayed-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Those eShop views don't come easily — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/35-upcoming-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-to-look-forward-to-in-2026">2026 release calendar</a> is yet another year bolstered by its predecessor's delays. Scan through the list that we outlined at the start of this article, and you'll see a bunch of tentative '2026' dates still hanging on games that were slated for the year prior. No biggies have been pushed back in the early weeks of this year, but it's only a matter of time. Delays will come, and when they do, we won't be surprised.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? Every developer we spoke to seemed genuinely confident in their initial dates, and it was only once launch loomed that it became apparent all the pieces wouldn't fit together. 'More realistic scheduling' feels a little oversimplified.</p>
<p>With more layoffs and studio closures happening every month, the 'quick fix' of improved budgets and resources also seems unlikely. If studios could find a way to better handle the unexpected and land on their launch date with their project — and their well-being — still intact, brilliant! But without a radical shift in how profits are distributed amongst large companies, it's unclear where that money could come from.</p>
<p>"It’s all business at the end of the day, which is hardly ever just black or white," Khan says. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping delays for good, but if indies and AAA behemoths are equally likely to succumb to deadline drama, then we can't see them going away any time soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Every month, Circana video game analyst Mat Piscatella posts fascinating data about video game sales on Bluesky, highlighting trends like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/846693/video-game-hardware-sales-november-2025-circana">November’s historically bad month for game hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month"><em>Battlefield 6</em>’s big launch in October</a>. But he doesn’t just share data about what is selling the most; as of late, he’s also posted delightful lists of games that have sold just a single physical copy over a certain period of time, and the lists often include retro games that take me down memory lane or titles that I didn’t even know existed.</p><p>The list of games that sold one physical copy <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">in October</a>, for example, includes the Xbox 360 version of <em>Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em> for the PS3. On Thursday, Piscatella posted the “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3md22ljxazs2o">2025 Circana Thread for Sickos</a>” highlighting games that only sold one physical unit over the <em>whole year</em> across various handhelds and consoles.</p><p>That list of games that sold a single unit in October was born out of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markcasey.bsky.social/post/3m62zi33ssk22">a question</a> from a user on Bluesky, Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “People seemed to enjoy the combination of journey down memory lane and the treasure hunting idea of these games being out there somewhere,” Piscatella says. Then people started asking him about it, so he thought it’d be fun to keep doing it.</p><p>Circana is able to track the data because it has agreements with “all major retailers” that let it compile and analyze point-of-sale data, Piscatella says. “I​​f a retailer’s point-of-sale system scans a product as a sale, it will show up in the data.” That means all the games he has mentioned in these threads “had one new unit floating around out there somehow that was sold through a register or via an online purchase. Perhaps it was a unit that had been lost somewhere in the back, or was buried under a display, or who knows.”</p><p>While it’s fun to look back and laugh at some of the games people bought — I feel sorry for the poor soul who purchased <em>Metroid: Other M</em> for the Wii last year — people buying an older, obscure game from a store is more common than you might think, Piscatella says. “There were more than 1,000 games across all platforms (including PC) that sold between one and five new physical units in the US during 2025, while over 3,500 different games sold at least one new physical unit at retail last year overall,” according to Piscatella. “Retailers have all kinds of stuff hidden away in those stores of theirs.”</p><p>I asked Piscatella how long he plans to continue making the threads highlighting games selling just one copy. “So long as it stays fun, I reckon,” he says. “But who knows.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/867004/circana-gaming-sales-data-mat-piscatella-one-copy-obscure-games]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has teased a potential crossover coming to Escape from Tarkov with a new promo code. This promo code and imagery to accompany it suggest that a ‘duck hunt’ themed event might be surfacing soon. This follows suggestions that Escape from Duckov and Escape from Tarkov will be hosting a crossover collaboration.</p>



<p>When you enter the Escape from Tarkov promo code, you’re greeted by a suite of items, including double-barreled shotguns, armor, vests, and ammunition, all of which you can use to <strong>hunt ducks</strong>.</p>











<p>When you load up the Escape from Tarkov launcher, be sure to enter the new bonus code, <strong>WILDHUNT</strong>. This will unlock the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>2 x MP-43-1C double-barreled shotguns</li>



<li>2 x Korund-VM body armor</li>



<li>2 x 6Sh112 S-S vests</li>



<li>2 x Ushanka hats</li>



<li>40 x AP-20 shotgun slugs</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many believe this promo code is teasing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov collaboration event</a>, which first hit the airwaves a couple of weeks ago. The team behind Escape from Duckov posted cryptic images suggesting that Tarkov’s big bosses, Killa and Tagilla, have made their way into the duck-themed extraction universe.</p>



<p>The image that was posted by Battlestate Games to share the new promo code features targets hammered by birdshot, and on those targets are quite clearly <strong>duck </strong>silhouettes.</p>



<p>The player character in the foreground is simply wearing the items offered in the new promo code.</p>



<p>Recently, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov suggested that collaborations are incoming and asked the community for some guidance on what kind of topics should be included in that. There’s a whole world out there, but players mostly wanted realistic, grounded collaborations, and not ‘Fortnite-like’ crossovers with gaudy skins and in-game takeovers.</p>







<p>Let us know if you’ve figured out what this new Tarkov promo code is teasing on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Blumhouse Games will release Vermila Studios' upcoming first-person horror adventure game, Crisol: Theater of Idols, on 10th February.</p>
<p>The horror, which looks to be a blend of Amnesia, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> (the combination of which makes me very happy), is coming to PC via Steam, as well as current-gen consoles.</p>

<p>"Explore the cursed island of Tormentosa, uncover dark secrets, and battle horrifying enemies," the description of the video - which you can see above - teases. "Will you survive?"</p>
<p>A playable demo - which is currently sitting on a Mostly Positive score on Steam - is available now should you wish to try before you buy.</p>
<p>Prior to jumping into games, Blumhouse is best-known for its horror films like M3gan, Annabelle, The Nun, and The Conjuring universe, amongst many others.

<p>While playing Square Enix's acclaimed 2020 remake on Nintendo's old hybrid would have felt like a pipedream, FFVII looks, runs, and feels exceptionally good on Switch 2. Sure, there are some technical downgrades from the PS5 version here and there *<em>cough</em>* 30fps *<em>cough</em>*, but overall, this is a rather wonderful display of what the new hardware can muster.</p>
<p>At least, that's what our Alana thought in her <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">9/10 review</a> of Square Enix's latest "remarkable" project. "For those who haven’t touched Final Fantasy VII before and are worried, don’t fret," she wrote, "even with some of the additions, the Switch 2 port is still an amazing way to experience (part of) one of the most influential games of all time."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196050 @ 1769284534 -->
<p>With the Switch 2 port now out in the wild, we want to know what you lovely lot make of it so far — whether this is your first time stepping into Midgar or if you're something of a seasoned professional by this point.</p>
<p>You can let us know your review score for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade by using the poll below. Of course, we don't expect you all to have finished it just yet, but that's the magic of this poll, you can come back and change your vote whenever you'd like!</p>

            <p>Bethesda is working to "address some of the topics that appeared" after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> update released earlier this week.</p>
<p>The update was supposed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-gets-another-hefty-patch-complete-with-ghoulish-fixes-and-quest-improvements">address a number of issues across quests, localisation, armour, and more</a>. However, the team has already had to disable the Weekly Raid Challenge due to reports that "the challenge was automatically completing, which resulted in rewards not being obtainable".</p>
<p>The developer says it is now "looking into" your reports and is using community feedback to identify a list of topics that "we plan to address in an update that is currently planned for release during the first week of February".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-developing-action-rpg-lore/</link>
            <guid>1415068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sledgehammer Games is best known for creating or contributing to the development of the Call of Duty franchise. The studio started in 2011 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and most recently assisted the likes of Treyarch and Raven Software on Black Ops 7, released towards the end of 2025.</p>



<p>But thanks to a recent developer profile on LinkedIn, it seems that the studio is (or at least <em>was</em>) working on an ‘unannounced action RPG’ with deep lore and a large-scale world.</p>



<p>It would be like nothing Sledgehammer has ever created.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-sledgehammer-making-a-new-rpg">Is Sledgehammer Making a New RPG?</h2>



<p>Sledgehammer Games has been <strong>mostly </strong>a support studio for the last few years, only leading the way on a couple of Call of Duty games: Modern Warfare III (2023) and Vanguard (2021). Elsewhere, the team has assisted in the creation of several other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that the studio has scope to create something new, but nobody had any money on the company’s next game being an action RPG.</p>



<p>For reference, the top action RPG games could be anything from Diablo to the likes of Fallout, depending on how you quantify or categorize the term ‘action RPG’.</p>



<p>In the most recent news for Sledgehammer Games, it was determined that the studio was working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch ports</a> for Call of Duty titles, but that tidbit is already months in the past.</p>



<p>This revelation about Sledgehammer’s action RPG title comes from the profile of a former developer, Ben Wanat. He’s now the Creative Director and co-founder of Lurker Entertainment, but from 2019 to August 2025, he worked at Sledgehammer Games as a Senior Creative Director.</p>



<p>In the blurb for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-wanat-17842671/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his role at Sledgehammer Games</a>, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Creative director for Unannounced action RPG</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise planning, pitching, hiring, planning</li>



<li>Directing prototypes, player mechanics for mechanics-rich design</li>



<li>World layout, location layout</li>



<li>Concept and asset creation for cultures, environments, characters</li>



<li>Lore books for world, cultures, languages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qlfrdb/sledgehammer_games_is_working_on_an_unannounced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>Otherwise, Wanat only contributed assistance to the development of Vanguard and seems to have had <strong>no hand </strong>in Modern Warfare III, which means he was likely free to contribute <strong>mostly </strong>towards the unannounced action RPG game.</p>



<p>Given the description of his role, it’s safe to assume that the game has/had deep lore, a branching world, innovative mechanics, and all-new, fictional cultures, races, and languages.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This coming-of-age adventure game made me feel a little too seen]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam</link>
            <guid>1415053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a lot about <em>Perfect Tides: Station to Station</em>’s Mara that I find relatable. Like me, she’s recently moved to a place simply called “the City” from the middle of nowhere, and like me, she’s an avid writer. But these biographical details aren’t the important thing; it’s the way she’s painted by the game’s incredibly sharp writing where I start to feel uncomfortably seen. There are a lot of characters in media that are awkward or socially anxious, but few that are drawn with such piercing specificity.</p><p>The point-and-click game is minimalist in its mechanics. Consisting mostly of conversations, it’s broken up by a few puzzles, object interactions, and minigames. This is not a complaint: it’s in talking to people that the game shines, because it’s how we get to see most of Mara. And she’s such a realized and resonant portrait of a person that I found myself grasping at where we were different as a coping mechanism against spending the <em>whole</em> time introspecting. I pride myself, for example, on never having had an awful boyfriend. In this, surely, I could find some self-soothing superiority over this poor video game character.</p><p>The dynamics of Mara’s relationship with her controlling, older, long-distance partner are sketched with both narrative and mechanical thoughtfulness. In one conversation, a health bar suddenly appears, and you must navigate a particularly difficult conversation without losing all of your hearts, some of which you gain only if you’ve spent time nurturing other connections. It’s one of many neat metaphors, and combined with the clever moment-to-moment writing, led to a particularly notable moment, which wrenched an “oh, for fuck’s sake” out of my mouth in real life.</p><p>It was then that I had completely bought into <em>Station to Station</em> . I thought I had the shape of it. Dear relatable Mara and her messy relationships that I could hold as a simplifying buffer between us. But the game wouldn’t settle for simplicity.</p><p>Aside from conversation, the other important mechanic is Mara’s writing. These manifest in assignments for school, guest blog posts, and, in one real low moment for Mara, an overly involved forum post, and you’ll need to combine topics together to complete the piece in question. These topics include the city, music, and sex, and they level up as you talk to people and experience the world. It’s a pretty simple but effective representation of how writing works: you learn things through living and then combine ideas into, hopefully, something new and expressive.</p><p>There’s one piece that works differently. Mara writes a story that is clearly a thinly veiled allegory for her own life, and a tutor gives her some relatively harsh feedback. For the rest of the game, the story looms in the back of her mind. You can’t fix this just by combining a thought your friend had about movies and your own ruminations on death caused by your ailing grandmother. But each of those might help a little as you chip away at it bit by bit. Without getting too self-indulgent about my own recent writing experiences, suffice to say <em>Station to Station </em>had once again skewered me. I had Mara work on it whenever I could, every time reminded of my own festering project and the trust necessary to wait and address it slowly.</p><p>At this point in the game, it’s clear that the aforementioned partner is not Mara’s only problem. In fact, most of her interactions with other characters are marred in some way or another. I, for one, would simply not get involved with these people! But again, the game resists simplicity. Although it always presents harmful interpersonal dynamics honestly and without excusing bad behavior, it absolutely refuses the idea of shutting yourself away to avoid them. Because you would miss out on too much. Too much joy, too much connection, too much potential.</p><p>In one of the only conversations in the game that feels purely uncomplicated and productive, a character tells Mara “you just have to risk it with someone and see.” <em>Station to Station </em>argues, over and over again, that being open to others, despite the risk of awkwardness, and of not being treated well, is worth it. Mara is naive, and not very good at knowing what she wants, let alone asking for it. And she does get hurt. But she also lives a much more beautiful life when she doesn’t close herself off to experiences and people. She deals with the consequences, and through this she learns and grows and flourishes. My knee-jerk perceived superiority in being avoidant is suddenly the crack through which <em>Station to Station</em> has sunk its claws into me. I will be thinking about it for a very long time.</p><p>There’s a lot more I could talk about, like the multiple excellent musical interludes, or the hugely exaggerated animations that feel genuinely expressive while also being consistently comedic. I could even complain bitterly about some of the incidental environmental puzzles and the way they ground the story to a screeching halt if you happened to miss one small interaction point. But what kept me thinking about the game long after the credits rolled was its emotional honesty and the emotional honesty it demanded of me while playing it.</p><p>After playing the game, I stewed for a couple of days, thinking about Mara, myself, and one particularly memorable bit of karaoke. And then it hit me: I never finished Mara’s rewrite. No matter how important it felt in the moment, it turned out to be much less crucial than Mara and I opening ourselves up and accepting the consequences, good and bad.</p><p><sub>Perfect Tides: Station to Station<em> is out now on PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE0MTA="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Castello</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> was supposed to be feature complete, with no major updates coming our way since 2021, but it turns out it's hard to keep a game that's sold nearly 50 million units down. A couple months back, Nintendo made the surprise announcement that Animal Crossing: New Horizons would be receiving a <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid Nintendo Switch 2 update, as well as a free 3.0 update</a> adding new content and long-requested quality-of-life features.</p>



<p>Do these updates justify returning to your (perhaps-long-neglected) island? Or is it not worth the trouble to even squash the cockroaches in your house? Sail on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing20.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's begin with the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition as it’s the update with an actual price tag, albeit a reasonable $5 one. The game, which suffered from fairly obvious jaggies on the OG Switch, now looks much crisper as it runs at 4K while docked (likely 1440p boosted to 4K using DLSS like most Switch 2 upgrades). Everything just has nice sharp edges now, which really benefits a lot of the intricately-detailed small objects and props in the game, but, of course, there is a limit to how transformed a game with Animal Crossing's visual style is going to be by a resolution bump (I would have perhaps liked to see HDR support too).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing21.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 upgrade also comes with a few other assorted additions, like mouse controls for drawing patterns and the ability to call out villager's names using the built in mic. There are also some improvements that simply come with the more modern hardware, like faster load times (a boon considering how much of a pain they were previously). That said, you're mainly paying for the visual fidelity boost, which I do think most people will find worthwhile at the price of a Big Mac, but that's up to you.</p>

<p>Arguably more interesting, at least from a new content perspective, is the 3.0 update, which, again, is available for free for both Switch 1 and 2 players. The big addition is the Hotel, which pops up on the pier and is run by Kapp'n and his reptilian pirate crew. Players are asked to design hotel rooms based on certain themes, with the game providing some items to fit those themes, and are rewarded with tickets that can be traded at the Hotel's shop for exclusive items. If this sounds very much like a stripped-down version of the not-that-keenly-remembered Happy Home Paradise DLC, well, that's because that’s basically what it is.</p>

<p>The Hotel is a fine addition for those who just can't get enough decorating, but there's no real challenge to it -- you can craft the perfect themed hotel rooms if you want, but you can also just slap more-or-less whatever together and still earn your tickets. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the hotel is that it attracts a steady stream of new animals to your island, which may be a good or bad thing depending on your temperament. On the one hand, some fresh blood! On the other hand, some folks who have very specifically curated their island's vibes and population may not enjoy all these new weirdos wandering around (I’m a YIMBY island manager myself).</p>



<p>The other big content addition are "Slumber Islands" -- essentially spare islands you can tinker with to your heart's desire, which, again, is great for the designers out there who just want more, more, more space for their designing, but they likely won’t be a game-changer for those who come to Animal Crossing for other things.</p>

<p>Most of the other 3.0 changes fall under the umbrella of QoL improvements, such as the ability to further expand your storage and craft directly using items in said storage, greatly reducing the amount of inventory juggling required. You can also now craft items in batches, activate a grid for designing outdoors, and get Mr. Resetti to clean up the junk on your island. All these changes are straightforward positives, with Mr. Resetti being particularly helpful for me, as my son has turned parts of my island into a bit of a hoarder’s paradise. Honestly, some may lightly curse Nintendo for not adding some of these features earlier.</p>



<p>Oh, and another thing! After being missing in action since the Gamecube days, you can again collect classic Nintendo consoles that actually allow you to play real retro games within New Horizons. Unfortunately, the implementation leaves a bit to be desired, as the selection of games is thin, light on bangers, <em>and </em>requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to work. Come on Nintendo, you couldn't have just given loyal Animal Crossing fans Clu Clu Land and Ice Climbers as freebies?</p>

<h2 id="h-a-final-form-on-the-horizon"><strong>A Final Form on the Horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition and the 3.0 update don't alter the vibes or scope of this well-worn game in any serious way, but their addition results in a more complete-feeling total package. Long-requested quality-of-life improvements are here, gameplay from the oft-ignored Happy Home Paradise DLC has essentially been folded into the main game, and everything looks sharp as a tack. Personally, I'm more interested in seeing where the Animal Crossing series sails off to next, but these updates ought to make your remaining days in this particular paradise more playable and pleasant than previous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update is available to download now on Switch 1 and 2. The Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade can be purchased for $5.</p>
