			<p>Saber Interactive has teamed up with Twirlbound to assist them in making their second game, The Knightling. Their first game was titled Pine, an open-world action-adventure game. The Knightling is shaping to be a fantasy action-adventure game released on<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Steam</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxYirnvx9_o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game has players stepping into the shoes of a knight-in-training, where you get to quest, explore, and participate in combat and platforming in a semi-open world.&nbsp; The Knightling is set on a grand quest to find Sir Lionstone, his mentor and protector of the realm named Clesseia. To keep himself safe, he wields a gigantic magical shield that will aid him on his journey to try and find his mentor before it's too late.</p>
<p>On his journey through the magical lands of Clesseia, there will be plenty of battles with monsters and bandits. At the same time, he works to uncover long-lost secrets to the realm and figure out the powers of Sir Lionstone's giant shield to make his journey less perilous.</p>
<p>Sir Lionstone's giant shield is the only thing that The Knightling has to protect him on his arduous journey, where he has to slowly figure out the intricacies of the shield and how to unlock all of its magical power. The shield can block, parry, bash, and use great attack combos on your foes. Much like in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Knightling can use the shield to slide across the peaks and valleys of Clesseia, helping speed up travel across the realm exponentially.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/">Saber Interactive</a> is a well-regarded publisher and developer worldwide, with 13 studios across the Americas and Europe. They have helped create and license games across all platforms globally, such as the highly anticipated Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, as well as games such as World War Z, and SnowRunner. In addition, they also helped develop games such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for Nintendo Switch, Crysis Remastered and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>Saber Interactive has over two decades of experience, with Twirlbound founded in 2013. Pine was their first game, and it was an award-winning debut. As shown in the reveal trailer, they are now working on The Knightling, which is due for release across all platforms in 2025.</p>

He remained defiant in the face of growing criticism, but didn’t deny the underlying allegation that his infamous June 2020 Twitch ban was over messages he had with a minor that “sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.” At the time, he stressed that “nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed,” while also calling his past behavior “stupid.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1823741433825698082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1823741433825698082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As noted</a></span> on Wednesday by esports/gaming interviewer Jake Lucky, the entire post has now been removed.</p><p>Instead, Beahm’s X profile now jumps immediately from a June 24 <em>Elden Ring</em> stream announcement to his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1818666012952477989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1818666012952477989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptic July 31 post</a></span> featuring a picture of himself behind a chessboard, which seemed to suggest he would soon be returning to streaming in some form, despite his over 4 million subscriber YouTube channel being demonetized as a result of the allegations.

Prior to that, he had remained silent, seemingly due in part to a 2022 settlement with Twitch in which he was reportedly paid out the rest of his seven figure contract.

<p>A new trademark has been filed by Techland for the Dying Light franchise. <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98693419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to a filing</a> on August 12, 2024 (h/t <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1823724772607582497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kurakasis</a>), Techland has registered a trademark for Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>Obviously, with it just being a trademark filing there’s not much to say regarding what exactly Dying Light: The Beast is. Dying Light 2 launched in 2022 and was the last game Techland released. We know there is another game in development at Techland, but details surrounding that have been scarce.</p>



<p>As of writing the trademark has not been approved due to it just being filed on the 12th. Still, it seems like a forgone conclusion that it will be finalized in the near future.</p>



<p>Here’s the full filing per the US Patent and Trademark Office:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DYING LIGHT: THE BEAST™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of&nbsp;cases for mobile phones; cinematographic films featuring computer games; computer game cartridges; computer game discs; computer peripheral devices; digital music downloadable from the Internet; downloadable computer application software for mobile phones, namely, software for computer games; downloadable computer game instruction manuals; downloadable computer game software; downloadable computer software to enhance the audio-visual capabilities of multimedia applications, namely, for the integration of text, audio, graphics, still images, and moving pictures; downloadable electronic game programs; downloadable electronic game software; downloadable electronic game software for use on mobile and cellular phones and handheld computers; downloadable interactive game programs; downloadable interactive multimedia computer game programs; downloadable multimedia file containing artwork, text, audio, video, games, and Internet web links relating to interactive, video, electronic and mobile games; downloadable music files; downloadable video game programs; downloadable video game software; electronic personal organizer; fitted plastic films known as skins for covering and protecting electronic apparatus, namely, mobile phones; graphics cards; headsets for use with computers; mobile phone straps; mouse pads; recorded computer application software for mobile phones, namely, software for computer games; recorded computer game software; recorded video game software; recorded video game programs..</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Techland regarding the trademark filing. Should a response be received, this article will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

You and up to three friends will get to play as The Mandalorian and his allies as they embark on a series of missions. Each character comes with their own deck of cards and features unique tactics--meaning you'll have to work together as a team to overcome the odds and survive. Games typically run for up to an hour and are designed for players aged 12 and up.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>An intriguing aspect of the board game is its changing ruleset. As you play, you'll stumble upon new mission types or unlock new parameters. For example, you may discover that there's a traitor among your crew, and you'll have to figure out their identity before they put a stop to your adventures. You'll find everything needed to start playing right out of the box, including character standees, tokens, cards, and a game board.</p><p>There's plenty of other Star Wars content for you to check out, so if you want more interactive experiences to complement The Mandalorian Adventures, here are some notable TTRPGs, board games, and card games to check out.</p><h2>Best Star Wars Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pandemic-Tactical-Strategy-Z-Man-Games/dp/B0BG9XZKTG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Star-Wars-Empire-RPG/dp/B09H1BMC3Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Sci-Fi RPG</a> -- $30 ($<del>40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Star-Wars-Age-Rebellion/dp/B09H19LV3J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Age of Rebellion TTRPG</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Risk-Star-Wars-Clone/dp/B00061I4Z6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Risk: Star Wars The Clone Wars Edition</a> -- $135</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Schematics-Players-Games-Collectors/dp/B09XJCVM1H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UNO: Star Wars Technical Schematics Card Game</a> -- $22 ($<del>24</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monopoly-Players-Inspired-Families-Exclusive/dp/B0B2F3VT9N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monopoly: Star Wars Return of the Jedi Edition</a> -- $25</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Lucas-Films-Trivia-Party/dp/B0B5YMK6M1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Say What You See (Trivia Party Game)</a> -- $10 ($<del>11</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mandalorian-Questions-Officially-Licensed-Merchandise/dp/B093Y4P3D6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Mandalorian Trivia Quiz</a> -- $7 ($<del>10</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals-games-controllers-nintendo-consoles/1100-6525715/">Best Nintendo Switch Game Deals This Week - Zelda And Mario Games For Big Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/horror-movies-new-releases-4k-blu-ray-halloween-2024/2900-5645/">Biggest Upcoming Horror Movie Blu-Ray Releases Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-pixel-remaster-collection-north-america-release/1100-6525641/">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection Anniversary Edition Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-steelbook-case-up-for-preorder-comes-with-free-4k-blu-ray-disc/1100-6525668/">Borderlands Movie 4K Steelbook Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-preorder-mario-and-yoshi/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Up For Preorder At Target</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-manga-box-set-gets-big-limited-time-deal-comes-with-treasure-chest-case/1100-6525318/">The Legend Of Zelda Manga Deluxe Box Set With Treasure Chest Is On Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-versus-marvel-comic-book-omnibus-amazon-preorder/1100-6525549/">DC Versus Marvel Finally Returns In October With A Massive Omnibus Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jeff-vandermeer-absolution-southern-reach-annihilation-preorder-guide/1100-6525451/">Snag 11 Jeff VanderMeer Books For $18 - Catch Up On Southern Reach Before Absolution Releases</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Activision sure is dragging out its reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode. But if you're sucker for the undead stuff, there's more where last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-zombies-mode-gets-a-first-trailer-and-story-details">trailer</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-purely-round-based-zombies-mode-gameplay-detailed">gameplay reveal</a> came from, with developer Treyarch having now offered a tour of Zombies' Terminus map.
</p>
<p>
Terminus Island is one of two maps that'll be available at launch (the other being the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls), and Treyarch calls it "one of the largest round-based Zombies maps ever created". Black Ops 6's Zombies mode takes place in the early 90s - five years after the events of Black Ops Cold War's Zombies mode - and Terminus Island serves as a prison for some familiar Requiem faces. After their liberation early at the start of the story, players can explore the prison itself before moving out to investigate its tropical island surroundings.
</p>
<p>
There's a secret research facility specialising in "weird science" (in case you were wondering where the zombies might spring up from this time), as well as the ocean, and assorted smaller islands - all of which players will visit as part of Terminus' main quest. It's described as a "living world" full of scripted encounters, ranging from zombies smashing out of vats and prison guards still trying to control the undead threat, to less fortunate souls being chomped on.
</p>

<p>
Treyarch's trailer also shows off the new Tentacle Trap - which can be placed above doorways to gobble up zombies as they pass through - and there's even a look at "something bigger" players might encounter out on the water as they sail from island to island in their Tactical Rafts.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything in Treyarch's latest Zombies reveal. Expect plenty more to come (including Zombies gameplay on 28th August) ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's 25th October arrival on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and certain tiers of Game Pass.

			<p>Today, Blizzard announced more details about <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwatch</a> 2 Season 12. First and foremost, the game's roster will be expanded with a new support hero, Juno from Mars.</p>
<p>Juno's versatile Mediblaster and Pulsar Torpedoes allow her to simultaneously heal her allies and damage her enemies, making her a fantastic support hero. Her Hyper Ring ability accelerates team movement for quick engagements and retreats, while her high mobility, enhanced by Martian Overboots, allows her to navigate the battlefield with unparalleled agility. Players may then unleash the power of her Orbital Ray and power up their teammates to break through tough strangleholds and fortified defenses.</p>
<p>There's also a new game mode called Clash, which pits teams against each other in a relentless battle for dominance over multiple capture points. With dynamic spawns and streamlined map routes, Overwatch 2 heroes can spend more time in the heat of battle and less time running back to the front lines. Clash mode delivers fast-paced, strategic gameplay with new challenges and opportunities for glory.</p>
<p>Two new maps have been included, too: players will return to ancient Egypt and discover a whole new side to Overwatch's first map, Temple of Anubis, and uncover the dangerous AI that caused the Omnic Crisis, sealed away in the Throne of Anubis. They will also uncover new secrets of Shiramura Castle while exploring the streets of Hanaoka, inspired by the stunning aesthetics of the beloved Hanamura area.</p>
<p>Season 12 will also bring some balance tweaks. Blizzard is reducing Health on multiple damage and support heroes. Lifeweaver is also getting notable updates to improve the quality of the Petal Platform and how it can be countered, as well as changes to Healing Blossom and Rejuvenating Dash. The competitive mode is getting a ranks reset to give everyone a fresh start and a new chance to work their way up the ladder. As mentioned in a previous developer update, the Avoid as Teammate feature is being improved. Finally, Blizzard listened to community feedback on group respawn in Quick Play and has new improvements in store for that feature as well.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Overwatch 2 will join Game Pass on September 17, providing various perks to subscribers who have successfully linked their Battle.net account. Starting on September 17, users will get a one-time grant of 30 Mythic Prisms to spend on Mythic unlocks, as well as six hero skins - Cardboard Reinhardt, Turtleship D.Va, Cyberdragon Hanzo, Street Runner Genji, Bee Mercy, and Cleric Lifeweaver. These items are theirs to keep, but they must log in and ensure their accounts are linked by October 21 to claim them.</p>
<p>Additional in-game collectibles will be continuously available as long as you have an eligible Xbox Game Pass account linked to your Battle.net account. These include an array of items via continued access to select Overwatch 2 Shop cosmetics from previous seasons, as well as a stackable XP booster.</p>

            <p>The next advance in video game graphics technology is not ray-tracing or tray-racing or any variation thereof - it's janky stop motion and rubbish plastic dolls, and it actually began about 30 years ago, when I watched the Adam and Joe show for the first time. If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i84waFSxX94">Titanic</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qga7yGat2KA">Saving Private Ryan</a> using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reptilian-rising">Reptilian Rising</a> is sort of Toymovie: The Game. </p><!--more-->
<p>Created by Gregarious Games and Robot Circus, it puts you in charge of squads of wonky plastic miniatures fighting evil reptilians on cardboard table-top dioramas. The characters range from Cleopatra through (three versions of) Churchill to off-brand riffs on Back To The Future's Marty McFly. The devs have just released a new trailer, following which I gave <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625460/Reptilian_Rising/">the Steam demo</a> a whirl, and while I have a few reservations, I could see myself enjoying this. </p>

<p>The reservations mostly concern the humour. This is one of those retro parodies that falls over itself to pile reference atop allusion atop in-joke. It's charming when it comes to the recreation of a tabletop wargame - the levels look exactly like the ones I knocked together for my dysfunctional High Elf army as a budding Warhammer player, and there's a nice, fat cassette player on one map with buttons you can press to stop the music. But the overegged dialogue voice-acting is a little yeesh, especially given that there aren't many lines per character. I get it, St George - you're a braying blue-blooded spoof. Please put that line about ye olde butt-kicking on cooldown.</p>
<p>I was tempted to stop playing, after a few moments of St Georgian patter. But sunk cost thinking prevailed - and it proved to be no fallacy at all, for I started having fun. Beneath the whimsy, Reptilian Rising is quite a sober tactics game. On the map I played, I had to seize control of crystals that summoned waves of hooded reptile cultists and cyborgs; once claimed, I could spend Time Energy at crystals to summon additional miniatures of my own.</p>
<p>Time Energy can also be spent on character upgrades like resistance to stun, and there are unpredictably spawning power-ups to lure you out of formation. You've also got to worry about a boss spawning after a countdown, unless you smash all the glowing purple dice. The overall picture is of a tactics game where you have to expand your position under varying pressures, rather than methodically whittling down a finite selection of foes. As for the characters, they fulfil familiar roles: Einstein is your artillery, armed with a beam cannon, while Not-Marty McFly gets a hoverboard for quick flanking. The off-map Reptilian overlord, who reminds me strongly of Bowser in the Bob Hoskins Mario movie, occasionally gives enemies orders that alter the odds - ordering them to focus fire on St George, for example. He has it coming, the bellowing nuisance.</p>
<p>It's no Into The Breach, but it entertained me enough that on finishing a demo mission and breaking off to write, I <em>almost</em> kept playing instead. If I'd recommend the developers do anything, other than varying the dialogue more, it's come up with a proper unboxing animation for each new miniature you harvest, rather than having them appear in a gust of Tardissy SFX. Let us rip the cardboard. Also, maybe a simulation of authentic wear and tear? I kind of want my Einstein to look like the dog has tried to eat him.</p>
<p>Reptilian Rising doesn't have a release date yet. While we're talking figurines, let me nudge you towards rad Celtic oddity <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a> and the work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-sluggish-morrs-and-dujanah-developer-jack-king-spooner">Jack King-Spooner</a> in general. If Reptilian Rising is Adam &amp; Joe, King-Spooner's creations have more in common with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jas8OABbn0Y">Mad God</a>.</p>

It’s a genuine cultural phenomenon and it’s getting a second season, as you might expect. But buried in the popular series is a small but direct reference to<em> Fallout 4 </em>that went unnoticed by the show’s director and most of its staff. And the person who snuck it in assumed nobody would spot it once the show was live. He was wrong.   </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/jonathan-nolan-and-the-writers-didnt-catch-it-but-boy-reddit-caught-it-fallouts-makeup-department-hid-a-sneaky-easter-egg-in-one-episode-that-fans-jumped-on-immediately/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/jonathan-nolan-and-the-writers-didnt-catch-it-but-boy-reddit-caught-it-fallouts-makeup-department-hid-a-sneaky-easter-egg-in-one-episode-that-fans-jumped-on-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span><em>,</em> <em>Fallout’s</em> makeup department head Michael Harvey said that the series’ creator and director, Jonathan Nolan, wanted the show to feel authentic to the games. But, he didn’t want anything to be ripped directly out of a <em>Fallout </em>game. </p><p>“[Nolan] explicitly told me, use the game as a reference,” Harvey told <em>PC Gamer.</em>  “Lean into the world for what it is, and take the elements from that world.” But, “Don’t carbon copy anything,” Nolan told Harvey. </p><p>However, when costume designer Amy Wescott dressed up a character in a way that made them look nearly identical to an NPC from <em>Fallout 4</em>, Harvey saw a chance to sneak a little Easter egg into the show. </p><p>“So I took that character and that likeness and literally made it one of the characters from the game, and I figured, you know what? It was such a [minor] character. Nobody’s ever going to catch it,” said Harvey.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d031a6754810e33bdff170c5fee2fae1" data-recommend-id="image://d031a6754810e33bdff170c5fee2fae1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows Rink and Cricket next to each other.

The writers didn’t catch it. But boy, Reddit caught it, and they went wild for it,” explained Harvey. “They went nuts over it, and they’re like, ‘We know exactly who that character is. We can tell you what game, what map, and what that person was’.” </p><p>If you are wondering, the character Harvey snuck into the show was Cricket, a minor NPC vendor from <em>Fallout 4. </em>In the live-action series, she is named Rink and appears on screen for just a few seconds. But that was more than enough for fans to spot her. </p><p> “That was my one little Easter egg that I was hoping nobody would catch right away,”  admitted Harvey. “[Fans] jumped on that so fast. So, kudos to the level and the depth that these fans will go.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 Update Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>Unfortunately for fans of the flamethrower, Eriksson noted that a simple revert would cause other problems in the game. He did add that the developer will update how the fire damage mechanic works, and reiterated that the game should be "fun, not 'balanced' for the sake of balance."</p><p>Over the next two months, Arrowhead Game Studios plans to re-prioritize fixing gameplay-impacting bugs first, in addition to making combat more appealing and "engaging." Arrowhead also intends to improve Helldiver 2's frame rate and "prevent excessive ragdolling." Additionally, Eriksson noted that Arrowhead is considering an opt-in beta-test environment for Helldiver 2 that may prevent the developers from making the same mistakes in the future.</p><p>The full list of planned changes is below.</p><ul><li>Continue to re-examine our approach to balance. Our intention is that balance should be fun, not “balanced” for the sake of balance.</li><li>Update how the fire damage mechanic works to tweak how the flamethrower serves as a close range support weapon. (A quick straight revert won’t work, as it would break other things)</li><li>Rework gameplay to prevent excessive ragdolling</li><li>Re-think our design approach to primary weapons and create a plan for making combat more engaging</li><li>Re-prioritize bug fixes so that the more immediate gameplay-impacting bugs are prioritized.</li><li>Improve game performance (frame rate is a focus)</li><li>Rework Chargers</li></ul><p>Additionally, from a bigger picture perspective we will be:</p><ul><li>Exploring creation of an opt-in beta-test environment to improve our testing processes and we consider this a high-priority.</li><li>Post regular player surveys to gather more insights and feedback from the community.</li><li>Improve our process for patch/release notes - providing more context and reasoning behind changes.</li><li>More blog posts and streams where we expand on these topics for those interested.</li></ul>

            <p>Eli Roth's recent Borderlands film adaptation hasn't exactly had the best debut. Ahead of release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">critics far and wide shared disparaging reviews</a> of the adaptation, with phrases such as "disaster" and "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud" being bandied about.</p>
<p>And then the film was released and, well, things didn't really get much better. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">Cate Blanchette-fronted adaptation generated just $4m on its opening day</a>, a disappointing result that looks set to result in the film becoming a commercial flop.</p>
<p>In fact, Borderlands has been such a misfire that now even filmmaker Uwe Boll - who previously directed <em>that</em> Alone in the Dark adaptation, which saw him nominated for not one but two 'Worst Director' awards (one of which he won) -  is taking a swipe at it.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/even-uwe-boll-is-dunking-on-the-borderlands-movie-fiasconow-you-wish-i-directed/">PC Gamer</a>, earlier this week Boll shared an infographic taken from IGN's social media account that detailed Borderlands' opening weekend sales figures. He captioned this image thus: "Ha ha. My movies were rated R and made more money than this. Now you wish I Directed."</p>
<p>One commenter was quick to call Boll out on his claim that his films had made more than Borderlands, noting that Alone on the Dark opened $2.8m, with a final gross figure of $12.6m. House of the Dead, meanwhile, opened to $5.5m with a final gross of $13.8m and Bloodrayne opened to $1.5m, with a final gross of $3.6m. These figures hardly set the film industry alight.</p>
<p>Boll then tried explaining that his films had actually made more than that thanks to illegal downloads (apparently his films have been illegally downloaded 41bn times). I have no idea how accurate that is, but it is some claim.</p>
<p>Regardless, this swipe at Borderlands from a man who made one of the most widely considered worst films of all time has got to sting.</p> <div>

<p>As for Borderlands, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick has asked that fans give the film a chance</a>. Meanwhile, Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford said he had <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822415283560005937">"blocked over a dozen accounts"</a> on X for being <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822410828102226241">"truly nasty"</a> about the movie.</p>
<p>He was a tad more optimistic about the whole video game to big screen thing earlier this year, calling the Borderlands film the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-start-of-cinematic-universe-randy-pitchford-says">start of a "Borderlands Cinematic Universe"</a> back in February.</p>
<p>Maybe Uwe Boll will make good on his quip, and throw his director's hat in the ring for the sequel? Hmm, yeah I am not sure either.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Newzoo's <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoos-global-games-market-report-2024-free-version?utm_campaign=GMRF%202024&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8iBt5oTDZS79Xe1-qVJstTTVYdzjQCnxI3tiqR4XPSPXszyDxzlMi1539oQAe8Hi8TDr9useQrVIYyZ9AUtGsgrlofQ&amp;_hsmi=318862100&amp;utm_content=318862325&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Games Market and Forecasts report</a> for 2024 has been announced. Non-subscribers can access a free report version, which still provides much information. This is one of the most highly anticipated financial reports for the gaming industry, as it contains predictions from 2022 through 2027, giving people some insights into how the gaming industry will perform over the years.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at 2024 for the gaming industry, the global games market will generate $187.7 billion, a 2.7% year-on-year growth. Considering the financial reports that have come out from some of the game industry's giants, this is a surprise. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/">Companies such as Nintendo</a> and PlayStation are experiencing significant drops in places.</p>
<p>The dormancy in the console gaming market is no surprise. Most consoles have had a slow two years, leading to a 1% decline year-on-year. All things considered, this isn't too bad of a number.</p>
<p>PC gaming revenues are up by 4% year-on-year for a profit of $43.2 billion, which will outgrow mobile and console revenues this year. However, by the time 2025 rolls around, it's predicted that console revenue will again be significantly higher than they are now and have the possibility to take over PC gaming revenues.</p>
<p>The global number of players was 3.145 million in 2022. That number has increased to 3.422 million and is expected to continue increasing to 3.759 million by 2027. With this number growing exponentially, the amount of money spent on gaming has increased. In 2024, global paying gamers will increase by 5% to $1.5 billion, with the revenue expected to increase to $1.67 billion by 2027 as gamers spend more and more each year on games.</p>
<p>Regarding other statistics, the number of players across every continent continues to grow. Asia has the most gamers, making up 53% of the total, with a 4% increase. This year, the Middle East and Africa experienced the most growth, gaining an 8.2% increase year-on-year in the number of gamers.</p>
<p>What may come as a surprise is the fact that mobile gaming is the highest source of revenue across all gaming, totaling 49% of all revenue. This makes a total of $92.6 billion, which is a 3% increase year-on-year.</p>
<p>The Newzoo games report covers many topics and information, such as what is benefiting the games industry right now and what isn't succeeding as much as it should be. One of the main factors that continues to benefit the games industry is releasing games on cross-platform. While it's becoming increasingly more common to do so, huge IPs from Nintendo still continue to be console-locked, with PlayStation slowly stepping out of the box by putting their games onto PC.</p>
<p>Whether Nintendo will ever do something similar remains to be seen, but it seems highly unlikely.</p>

As a fan of Tolkien’s fantasy world, I thought it had its moments, but a lot of it felt like a waste. Season 2, based on the trailers at least, feels like it’s shaping up to be something else entirely. A second look at the upcoming episodes shows where all the action and drama that fans missed the first time around ended up. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>  <em>Rings of Power</em>’s second season 2 trailer shows Middle-earth heading to war as Sauron sets his plans in motion and unlikely alliances are forged. On one end, we get big setpiece battles full of orcs and fireballs, and on the other we get an emotional descent into wraith-ness from Charles Edwards’s Celebrimbor.

<p>Valve is set to allow its SteamOS to function on rival handheld devices. After <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent update notes</a> mentioned support for ROG Ally keys, many wondered if this meant the operating system was going to come to the ASUS ROG Ally and other handhelds like the Lenovo Legion GO.</p>



<p>According to Valve itself, that’s exactly what’s happening.</p>



<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve’s Lawrence Yang says the team is working on bringing full support for other devices.</p>



<p>“The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS,” Yang said. “The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS.”</p>



<p>As far as how it would work, that’s unknown as it’s unlikely that any non-Steam Deck handhelds would come with the operating system preinstalled. Still, with future support, it would allow users to easily install SteamOS and know their device will still function properly even with a different layout.</p>



<p>There’s also no timeline as to when full support will be available. According to Yang, via The Verge, it’s not “ready to run out of the box yet.”</p>

                <p>Valve has confirmed that SteamOS--its Linux-based operating system for the Steam Deck handheld gaming PC--will be coming to the Asus ROG Ally. The company also plans to roll out SteamOS to other rival Windows handhelds, although it has noted that third-party support "isn’t ready to run out of the box yet". The confirmation comes after the recent release notes for a recent SteamOS beta update mentioned adding support for "extra ROG Ally keys" in the future.</p><p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS", Valve engineer Lawrence Yang said to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. "The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS."</p><p>While Asus has yet to comment on its ROG Ally being potentially turned into a Steam machine, an update like this would address a major criticism of the handheld. Asus ROG Ally devices use a Windows 11 operating system, and while that does allow for various game clients to be installed, using the OS can be cumbersome as it's optimized for desktops, not thumbs and smaller screens. In comparison, SteamOS is a more fluid and user-friendly experience.</p><h2>Asus ROG Ally X and Ally Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4349952-rog-ally-x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4349952-rog-ally-x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349952"></a><figcaption>Asus ROG Ally X</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4349952-rog-ally-x.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1844733087673373358%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally X</a> -- $800</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028544647762629%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme with free carrying case</a> -- $650</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028407127445674%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally Z1 with free carrying case</a> -- $500</li></ul><h2>Asus ROG Ally Accessories</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1842771478471222497%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ROG Ally charger</a> -- $30 ($<strike>65</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.co0/?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Raikiri Pro controller</a> -- $110 ($<strike>150</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/officially-controller-remappable-sensitivity-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C6WQX5ZW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Raikiri standard controller</a> -- $75 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Headphones-Low-Latency-Cancelation/dp/B0BRSCKG2D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Cetra earbuds (white)</a> -- $65 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Headphones-Low-Latency-Cancelation/dp/B09VP3YXX9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Cetra earbuds (black)</a> -- $80 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li></ul><p>This news comes hot on the heels of the launch of the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1844733087673373358%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, an updated version of last year's ROG Ally.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via ShiftUp/PlayStation.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The traditionally online and free-to-play-based game industry of South Korean game development may be shifting gears. According to a recent report from Wesley LeBlanc in the final issue of Game Informer, developers at multiple studios like Round8 Studio, Shift Up, and Pearl Abyss are seeing signs that players at home and abroad are attracted to single-player experiences on PC and console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">LeBlanc reached out to developers after seeing these companies releasing single-player games like Round8 Studio's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lies of P</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Shift Up's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(published by Sony Interactive Entertainment), and Pearl Abyss' upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crimson Desert</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even longtime online and mobile publishers are spreading their platform wings, with Nexon subsidiary Neople soon releasing the single-player </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Berserker: Khazan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and NCSoft bringing the free-to-play PC game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Throne and Liberty</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to consoles in September.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers at these companies confirmed to LeBlanc that the trend is real—and more of them are joining the "traditional" console and PC market sometimes thought to be calcified here in the West.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But why are they making the jump? There wasn't one clear answer—instead a constellation of factors seem to be driving the shift. But those stars all orbit the same point: that players buying games on console and PC are hungry for fresh experiences.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="South Korean developers see market shifts across the globe and at home">South Korean developers see market shifts across the globe and at home</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The immediate economic argument for these games is that they open up new overseas markets for South Korean developers. Round8 Studio CEO Jason Park told Game Informer that there are a "fixed number of people" who play single-player games on console and PC in South Korea, and that number "won't change." He said Round8 made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lies of P</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a global market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shift Up CEO and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Kim Hyung-tae partly agreed with Park, explaining only 5 percent of the PlayStation 5 exclusive </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s sales came from his home country, and console share in the country isn't growing. He does think the market for single-player PC games can grow, which is why the company is considering a PC port for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Others do see market movement inside the region. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lies of P</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Jin Won Choi said a major indicator he saw was the shift in what games students are making at universities. At a recent showcase, only one out of 17 student groups was making a mobile game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hyung-tae said he thinks the shift inside South Korea correlates to an age and income shift in mobile players. Because popular mobile games in the country are so heavily designed around grind-based monetization, older players with lots of money to burn are more likely to play them. He referred to this demographic as being "middle-aged."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's continued for the past 20 years, and players have become older, so it's harder to acquire new and younger users for...games," he told Game Informer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pearl Abyss America CEO Jeonghee Jin disagreed with the idea that console growth in South Korea is inevitably stalled, estimating that the market share has grown 4-5 percent since the launch of the PlayStation 4. South Korean game developers didn't start making console games until that generation, she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin's emphasis on developer experience may hold weight. Hyung-tae explained to Game Developer that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s development was "difficult," and that the team had to learn much of the process "from scratch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever's driving the growing single-player market, developers and game industry professionals have plenty of reasons to refresh their thinking about South Korean game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Normally this would be where we we would link to Game Informer's original reporting. However GameStop did not publish this story on the outlet's website before shutting it down, meaning it is only readable in the final print edition of Game Informer. If you wish to read the rest of LeBlanc's report, we urge you to seek out a physical copy.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember when everybody was <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-joel-pc-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awooga-eyes in love with <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>? When the whole world had <a href="https://aftermath.site/blaseball-helldivers-2-joel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Fever</a> and every inch given or taken in the game’s endless intergalactic tug-of-war elicited gasps from onlookers? That was six months ago. Now each week brings some new lamentation about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-helldivers-2-balancing-patches-have-gone-too-far-recently-it-feels-like-every-time-someone-finds-something-fun-the-fun-is-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">balance changes</a> or <a href="https://x.com/Leuk0s/status/1823068806987796928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining player counts</a>. The honeymoon period is over, replaced by the kind of shapeshifting malaise that’s come to characterize pretty much every other live service game.</p><p>Right now <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are fuming over changes that weaken the game’s flamethrower, to the point that some have elected to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/let-super-earth-burn-helldivers-2-players-are-committing-treason-to-protest-its-latest-patch-allowing-a-tide-of-bots-to-creep-worryingly-close-to-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let Super Earth itself burn</a> in protest. This follows controversy over balance changes <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-s-enormous-balance-patch-means-business-weapons-are-getting-buffed-galactic-map-supply-lines-are-here-solo-patrols-are-sensible-again-and-the-worst-mission-modifier-is-gone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in June</a>, which followed controversy over balance changes <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-helldivers-2-balancing-patches-have-gone-too-far-recently-it-feels-like-every-time-someone-finds-something-fun-the-fun-is-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in May</a>, and, well, you get the idea. Developers have responded with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempts at placation</a> while continuing to push a Sisyphean pace only partially of their own making. While it’s true that Arrowhead came out the gate exceedingly hot, <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-automatons-win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivering twists and updates</a> at an <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-wants-to-slow-down-the-pace-of-updates-we-feel-a-slightly-lower-cadence-overall-will-benefit-both-us-you-and-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">astonishing clip</a>, that’s not really the core of the problem here. Rather, <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s entire pitch – the promise of granular reactivity that it’s struggled to live up to, especially where balance is concerned – was born of a landscape that’s unsustainable.</p><p>The “live” part of live service, somewhat paradoxically, is pretty much guaranteed to result in a death spiral. Players will eventually get their fill of what’s available and become dissatisfied. They will then begin to let developers know, first a few at a time, until others catch up in terms of progress or even just hear about it on a subreddit, at which point the problem becomes an avalanche. After that, it’s a race against time to add more content and turn community sentiment back in developers’ favor – a race they will never actually win, because it always starts over hours after an update goes live.&nbsp;</p><p>The team behind <em>Helldivers </em>at least had the right idea: Instead of over-relying on <em>Destiny 2</em>-style expansions that take years to develop, they built a game around an ever-shifting conflict whose parameters are relatively easy to tweak. This ensures that the game continues to feel alive even when the team is mostly heads-down on additions that won’t see the light of day for months.&nbsp;</p><p>But even then, as <em>Helldivers 2</em> has shown us, there are simply <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/helldivers-2-s-loudest-players-are-going-nuclear-over-another-unpopular-nerf-but-arrowhead-s-ceo-is-keeping-calm-some-are-going-buff-everything-others-are-saying-it-s-too-easy-most-are-just-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too many competing interests</a> vying for developers’ attention. A vocal faction of the fan base will almost always be upset, giving off the impression that <em>something </em>is wrong, which content-hungry YouTubers, streamers, and websites will seize upon. They can support this claim with all sorts of supposed evidence, like the aforementioned dwindling concurrent player count – down from hundreds of thousands on PC when the game first launched to around 30,000-50,000 now. Never mind that most games <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1823134123554210284?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would <em>kill </em>for 30,000-50,000 concurrent players</a> and that many will likely return when the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-third-faction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-awaited third enemy faction</a> makes its debut; people will still say that <em>Helldivers 2</em> has suffered one of the most precipitous falls from grace of all time, that it’s a “dead game.”&nbsp;</p><p>None of this should surprise anybody who’s played any other live service game, the most successful of which have bounced back from being “dead” too many times to count. The issue in the eyes of many, I think, is that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was supposed to somehow be different. On paper, it had everything figured out, not to mention a truly immense stockpile of goodwill to blow through. But the live service model doesn’t allow for happy endings – just bickering trudges up mountains whose peaks are shrouded in suffocating fog.&nbsp;</p><p>On multiple occasions, Arrowhead has attempted to demystify its process, to explain why elements of the game aren’t where players would like them to be yet. Most recently, CEO Shams Jorjani <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-we-need-to-do-better-after-incendiary-response-to-flamethrower-nerfs-in-helldivers-2-me-just-talking-about-it-isn-t-enough-actions-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s Discord</a> that “we have long lead times on development” and “some changes take time before they show” while, at the same time, the company is still trying to figure out how to cater to a much larger audience than it was expecting.&nbsp;</p><p>"We know the [three hour] a week casual dads play differently and want different things than the [thirty hours] a week [high difficulty] crowd,” Jorjani wrote. “We haven't quite figured this out, and it's really new territory for us."</p><p>This is a completely understandable state for an overnight success like <em>Helldivers 2</em> to be in after just <em>six months</em>. In a more reasonable gaming ecosystem, most people would react to this by either putting up with mild annoyances for a time or by stepping away to play one of a million other games until<em> Helldivers 2 </em>was more to their liking. Perhaps they have! But that’s not the portion of the player base that dominates the conversation or sets the pace at which developers are expected to work. What we get instead are communities that constantly rile themselves up, that live perched on the precipice of outcry. Developers – even ones as forward thinking as Arrowhead – find themselves on the defensive, rolling with the punches rather than putting their best foot forward. It’s exhausting to watch, let alone be a part of.</p><p>There are some bright spots. It’s been cool to see the developers behind <em>World of Warcraft</em> figure out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/8/12/24209862/world-warcraft-wow-classic-20th-anniversary-retrospective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique ways to remix pre-existing content</a>, to find new means of keeping the game feeling lively during periods of between-expansion dormancy. Hopefully other studios can learn from their example, though obviously <em>WoW </em>has <em>a lot</em> more locales, quests, and characters with which to work than most other games. Sometimes you get redemption arcs, too; <em>Destiny 2</em> looked like it was on the decline for years until <em>The Final Shape</em> came out in June and was greeted with immediate adulation.&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>Destiny 2</em> is also illustrative of where live service games can end up in more dispiriting ways. It’s no secret that Bungie’s studio culture has spent serious time in the toilet both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-Sony</a> – that whether it got acquired or not, there was perhaps not a world in which its approach to live service development was fully sustainable. Now the company is being ravaged by <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brutal mass layoffs</a>, and the future is not looking bright for any of its games. But that’s the thing: <em>some </em>sort of end awaits every so-called “forever game.” And ends, no matter how promising their starts, are rarely pretty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
