			<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-2k-mafia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that the whole Mafia franchise is coming to GeForce NOW. This includes the classic titles, the remakes and remasters, and even the upcoming Mafia: The Old Country game, which will be available on the cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at launch on August 8</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Survival Machine (New release on Steam, May 7)</em></li>
<li><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Spirit of the North 2 (New release on Steam, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II (Classic) (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia III: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Towerborne (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On this GeForce NOW list, our David Carcasole has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> Revenge of the Savage Planet, which he found funny, beautiful, and yet tedious:</p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</em></p>
<p><em>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-strongest-ability-is-getting-nerfed.1184163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s most powerful abilities is about to get nerfed, so if you want to keep doing absolutely outrageous damage numbers with Maelle, you've got one more day to get your fill.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, developer Sandfall Interactive says that Maelle's ability Stendhal has "ended up overshadowing most other options" in the fencer's arsenal. The studio says the ability was "underwhelming for most of development", which resulted in a "big damage boost" that the developer says "overdid it".</p>

<p>Sandfall says that it "hadn't planned to make any balance changes" this early into&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s release, but that Stendhal's overpowered nature "clearly stood out", making things "a bit too easy" for those using Maelle in combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=IUpEg18O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=vFjl_iwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maelle's most powerful ability is getting nerfed in&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite Stendhal's nerf, Sandfall says it still very much wants you to "be able to break the game", and that you "absolutely still can".</p>

<p>Stendhal will remain a "strong single-hit skill with great synergy potential", but it'll be "more in line with everything else" rather than standing out as Maelle's best option in every combat situation.</p>

<p>Changes to the ability will come as part of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s first round of hotfixes, which will arrive on Steam tomorrow, with other platforms to follow soon after. There likely won't be any other changes on the same level as those being made to Stendhal.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you haven't yet unlocked the Stendhal ability for Maelle, it becomes available automatically at the beginning of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s third act. I shan't say any more for fear of spoilers.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is a turn-based RPG heavily inspired by classic JRPG franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive, the game takes place in the Belle Epoque-inspired land of Lumiere, which is subject to the whims of the Paintress, a monstrous figure who paints a descending number each year, causing everyone of that age or above to die.</p>

<p>It's proven a popular game among fans; sales of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reached two million</a> within less than two weeks of the game's launch, despite the fact it's also available on Game Pass.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can play it as part of a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate subscription as well.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> releases next week, and with it the realisation that Doom Guy has come a long way since the murder of his <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Daisy">beloved rabbit Daisy</a> at the hands of hell. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pigface">Pigface</a> is naturally a genre descendant of Doom, I cannot say for certain if the evil rabbit that commands you to go do sledgehammer murder in its <a href="https://titolovesyou.itch.io/pigface-combat-demo">Itch.io combat demo</a> is a descendant of Daisy. Either way, it's an ominous critter. "You know what you did to deserve this," says the rabbit. A free sledgehammer? Thanks rabbit! I knew I was good this week.</p>

<p>Ah, so you've actually got a bomb collar around your neck. I knew not to trust a creature who'd so willingly part with quality tools. You're immediately thrown into ramshackle kill gauntlets, first with the hammer, then with guns. You gobble down morphine syringes to heal. Everyone you fight wears a mask and no shirt, lured here by the promise of a fat payday if they can kill you. Guns feel tight and good to use, but the act of actually shooting people feels oddly guilty.</p>
<p>These sort of snuffy, Manhunt vibes can go either way, but Pigface embracing the bleak cruelty of its premise works, I think, in service of a hopeless, grimy atmosphere. It's been a while since a game made me feel genuinely nauseous, but art that hits you right in the stomach is effective art all the same. It reminds me, if anything, of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a> that's decided to wallow in the lethal nastiness of game guns instead of deconstructing them. There's a little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> in there too.</p>
<p>The combat demo has been floating around for a bit now, but the game recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3341650/view/496068513597753194">received full funding</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/white-knuckle">White Knuckle</a> publisher DreadXP, and is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341650/PIGFACE/">coming to Steam</a> at some unspecified point in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The developer explained that the move to a paid game will help the game increase its visibility, as well as test interest for potential expansion of the retro demake.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2593450/view/546734643204849716" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam news update</a>, the team behind Furi Demake announced that fans would have until June 23 to grab the game for free, at which point it would become a paid game. "Unfortunately a free game can only enter a limited amount of fests or events on Steam," the update explained, saying that the demake hadn't been getting as much visibility as initially hoped. "Making it paid will allow us to register it in events, discount it, and make it visible to more people."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9nTiXyKGhQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w9nTiXyKGhQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this, making the game paid will be a way of testing demand for the retro-styled game, potentially allowing Furi Demake to expand to include other Furi bosses. At present, the demake only includes Furi's first boss fight, The Chain.</p><p>Furi is a fast-paced arcade-style action game by The Game Bakers that blends sword-fighting and shooting in a series of punishing boss battles. The studio teamed up with solo developer Sylph for the 8-bit demake, which reimagined the game's first boss fight, and released it for free as a "love letter to [Furi's] community."</p><p>Now, it looks like The Game Bakers want to do more with the retro proof-of-concept, but at least they've given fans plenty of warning before putting the price up. You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2593450/Furi_Demake__The_Chain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Furi Demake - The Chain for free on Steam</a> until June 23.</p>

                <p>The developer behind viral browser game One Million Checkboxes is back, and this time there's One Million Chessboards. The online browser game has no real rules or win states: It simply lets players loose on a playground--or battlefield--made up of a million chessboards.</p><p>The rules of <a href="https://onemillionchessboards.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One Million Chessboards</a> are simple: "Moving a piece moves it for everyone, instantly. There are no turns. You can move between boards." Other than that, players are free to do what they wish within the bounds given--whether that's capturing as many enemy pieces as possible, capturing as many enemy kings as possible, taking on another player in live combat, or just getting creative with it.</p><p>The game tracks a number of stats that add depth to how players may choose to engage with it--the total number of pieces remaining on the board for both black and white teams, and the total number of kings remaining for each team. You can also track your stats as an individual player by number of captures and number of moves made, and you can even find a nearby online player to engage in live battle by clicking the skull icon in the navigation panel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490532" data-ratio="0.56241872561769" data-width="1538" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490532"></a><figcaption>One Million Chessboards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg"></figure><p>Every piece on the board also tracks how many moves it's made, how many pieces its captured, and even collect special tags based on its activity. Extra-lethal pieces even pick up an icon that's visible to all players without the piece being selected.</p><p>The project comes from experimental developer Nolen Royalty, who also goes by Eieio. "I like putting games in surprising places and helping strangers interact on the internet," Nolen says of his work, and One Million Chessboards is the most ambitious manifestation of that ethos yet.</p><p>Nolen says the project is the "most technically challenging thing" he's worked on in some time, and <a href="https://eieio.games/blog/one-million-chessboards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his website</a> gives a brief rundown of what's happening under the hood to keep its 1 million chessboards tracking.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has predicted how many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 consoles</a> it expects to sell during its 2026 financial year, which will cover the first 10 months of the hybrid gaming console when it hits the market on June 5. According to Nintendo's results for the full financial year that ended on March 31, it's forecasting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles and 45 million games.</p><p>This would put it close to the sales figures of the original Switch console, which launched in March 2017 and reached 17.79 million sales globally during its first 13 months. It's also worth noting that Nintendo is predicting that the Switch 2 will reach its sales goal in 10 months. There are other elements to consider as well--like the Switch 2 having a higher MSRP of $450 for the base model--but the company has factored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">US president Donald Trump's tariff</a> rates for its sales. In Japan, demand has outstripped supply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-scammers-are-convincing-people-they-won-the-nintendo-lottery-in-japan/1100-6531112/">Nintendo says preorders that side have exceeded its expectations</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-star-wars-fortnite-fans-expect-another-themed-mini-season-this-year-potentially-involving-the-simpsons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is currently in the midst of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-getting-the-force-with-chapter-6-season-3-star-wars-themed-season-galactic-battle">dedicated Star Wars mini-season, Galactic Battle</a>, but fans are already looking to the future. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' battle royale/metaverse has hosted themed seasons before, but only around Marvel. Now, the shorter length and naming of Fortnite's big Star Wars crossover has fans expecting other similar mini-seasons in future.
</p>
<p>
Officially, Galactic Battle is referred to in-game as Chapter 6: MS1, or Mini-Season 1, something which rather suggests there will be a Mini-Season 2 as well. And indeed, growing whispers suggest another Disney-owned property is being lined up for a crossover later this year: The Simpsons.

<p>
Fortnite has long had a close partnership with Disney, and the two companies have only grown closer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">since the latter's $1.5bn investment</a> to help fund <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-x-fortnite-collab-moves-into-stable-branch-exactly-a-year-after-disney-invested-15bn-in-epic-games">an upcoming Disney mode</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Following the launch of other Disney-owned characters in Fortnite, including those from Disney's own animated films, Pixar movies and Family Guy, The Simpsons' arrival in Fortnite has only seemed like a matter of time. 
</p>
<p>
Now, a <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238">cluster</a> of <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920271960937791525">smaller</a> Fortnite <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1920276038921204113">leakers</a> have cautiously pointed to a potential Simpsons mini-season later this year, based on access to leaked game information that correctly detailed Fortnite's Star Wars season before it was revealed.</p>
<p>While this is far from a confirmation, it isn't the first time word of a Simpsons crossover has been touted - having originally been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/1epsjko/fortnite_x_the_simpsons_is_in_development_via/">noted</a> by another Fortnite leaker as in development late last year.
</p>
<p>Last night's leak also reveals other potential details of Fortnite's future content roadmap, and comes almost exactly a year on from the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">2024 content schedule being leaked in its entirety</a> ahead of time. Eurogamer has contacted Epic Games for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5 fan-made remake is in development, and it's looking great with some advanced visual features in a new video shared online this week.</p>
<p>The fan-made remake of the third main entry in the series by id Software is being worked on by François Montagud, who shared a look at the latest version of the remake in a new video. The new version of the remake, which is sadly not available for download publicly, features reworked visual and gameplay aspects to enhance the game's atmosphere and tension. These reworked features include improved dynamic lighting and FX, more reactive AI behaviors, updated shooting system with better visual feedback, reworked sound effects, and more. While far from perfect, it's undeniable how this tech demo gets a lot of things right, and some of its elements are downright impressive, such as the smoke behavior with the dead enemy at the 2:20 mark.</p>
<p><iframe title="[UE5] DOOM 3 Fan Remake" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZNjRkCNs0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5. remake cannot be played right now, fans of the id Software series will soon be able to enjoy a new entry in the series with DOOM: The Dark Ages, which is launching next week on PC and consoles. The next entry in the series promises to be another excellent action-packed first-person shooter, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/"> hands-on preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</em></p>

The mod itself was based on the GTA 6 mapping project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, I asked Garza if he was worried about potential action from Take-Two, and he admitted to "some mild concern."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This project has been going on for quite some time with no direct disruption to our community," Garza continued. "However, I always keep it into consideration if they intend on communicating with us in the future for any reason. We do not explicitly showcase leaked material in the map, so I do not believe they would take that down in particular. I believe they are aware that this project gathers popularity and interest in the game, since everyone wants to see how the world may look like. This can be one of the reasons why they haven’t done anything, since it’s not too negative.

Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half a year later, Pocketpair has now provided an update admitting recent changes made to the game were indeed the result of the legal threats. Pocketpair confirmed that Patch v0.3.11, released in November 2024, was the result of the ongoing litigation - as players suspected. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair said that if it hadn’t made these changes to Palworld, “the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it doesn’t stop there. Pockeptpair said that today's Patch v0.5.5 makes further changes to Palworld so that gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair called these changes “compromises” the studio is being forced to make out of fear of an injunction being granted that could block the development and sale of Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld,” Pocketpair said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite making these changes, Pocketpair said it will continue to dispute the claims made in the lawsuit, focusing on asserting the “invalidity” of the patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Pocketpair's statement in full:</p><blockquote>We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</blockquote><blockquote>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.<br>On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Crux of FromSoft right there, I reckon: expert awareness over when to trim the fat, absolute lack of self-consciousness over being goofy as hell while doing it. Nightreign is set for release at the end of the month, 30th May, but despite us being in the midst of hypetown, the PlayStation interviewer shattered my expectations for a promotional blog by actually positing a potential negative about the game. A FromSoft game, no less! Your bravery has not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>"After playing the network test, while I enjoyed building my characters, I also felt like the strategy aspect became a little repetitive. Can we expect more unpredictability that encourages players to be more tactical, in the final product?" they ask.</p>
<p>"We’re also pursuing that approach," replies Ishizaki. "The same strategy won’t always work when fighting the bosses. Your initial strategy may be effective for a while, but the bosses will gradually evolve and your tactics will no longer be viable, forcing you to rethink your approach."</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what Ishizaki means by "evolve" here - it's one of those vague marketing words developers like to use. It could be a reference to the second, more powerful phases FromSoft bosses traditionally have when you've beaten them up a bit, stat modifiers, or simply that different bosses act differently. I'd love it to be an Arkham Mr. Freeze situation, obviously, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>"In the final version of the game, you’ll be able to determine the weakness of each boss before heading out," Ishizaki continues. "So, if poison is effective against an upcoming boss, you may proactively search for and loot items that inflict poison more often in that run. Taking advantage of their susceptibility will give you an edge in the fights. We intentionally designed the game so that you’ll need to adapt and evolve your strategies along with the changes that happen in the game."</p>
<p>There's that evolve word again, but this all broadly sounds within the spirit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> to me. Ishizaki goes on to talk about some tweaks following the recent network tests, such as more player guidance. He also chats a bit about designing the playable characters as fantasy archetypes for common builds. "A character like a  ‘macho wizard’ may exist if there were a hundred variations, but it’s a bit too eccentric when we only have a few playable characters". Here's a D&amp;D 5e homebrew wiki page <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Wizard_(5e_Class)">for a Muscle Wizard</a>, in case you're as disappointed by this news as I am.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, I recently got to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">play 30 hours of the game for preview at Kojima Productions</a>. Though not the biggest fan of the original, I came away hugely impressed by the improvements made in this sequel.</p>
<p>"Death Stranding 2 is clearly a labour of love, filled with carefully balanced gameplay systems, exceptional visuals, and extraneous details and secret scenes (Dollman certainly likes his music), all wrapped up in Kojima's irrepressible sense of cool," reads the preview.</p>
<p>"Like the studio he works from, the game is a gateway into his post-pandemic mind as, now in his 60s, he contemplates life, death, family, human connection, future legacy, and - most important of all - which musician he'll be listening to next. In that sense it, so far, feels like the most Kojima-game yet, a culmination of all his prior achievements."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-wont-make-it-himself">Kojima also stated he has a concept for a possible further sequel</a>, but doesn't plan to make it himself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 18-inch behemoth is packed with top-end specs, including the option for a 4K-capable 2D / 3D screen, Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, up to 192GB of RAM, and 8TB of SSD storage.</p><p>How much will an over-the-top configuration like that cost? Nobody can say, as Lenovo isn’t talking pricing at all yet — not even the starting price for the base model with a 4K, non-3D screen. But when the time comes you won’t have to rely solely on Lenovo to build the configuration to your liking, as the four RAM slots and four SSD slots are user-accessible.</p><p>The optional 2D / 3D LCD can display 3840 x 2400 resolution at up to 240Hz in 2D mode or 1920 x 1200 in 3D mode. The screen also has a dual mode akin to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619052/razer-blade-18-nvidia-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-preorder-asus-msi">Razer Blade 18</a>, allowing up to an ultrafast 440Hz when displaying 2D content in 1920 x 1080. Viewing 3D content on the Legion 9i’s screen doesn’t require glasses, as it uses eye-tracking and a lenticular lens array to appear 3D to the naked eye. Lenovo says the Legion 9i is designed for game developers, visual artists, and 3D professionals as well as spendy gamers. In addition to displaying 3D content and renders, Lenovo says its software supports 30 games playable in 3D. We have reached out to Lenovo for a list of compatible games, but did not receive an answer by time of publication.</p><p>As you’d expect from a desktop replacement-class laptop, the Legion 9i has a bunch of ports, including two Thunderbolt 5 ports, four USB 3.2 Gen 2 (three Type-A and one Type-C), an ethernet port, HDMI 2.1, and even a full-size SD card slot. For connectivity, it’s got Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support. If you go for the 2D screen the 5-megapixel webcam has an f/2 aperture, though the 3D screen option comes with a faster f/1.6 lens — and both webcams feature a kill switch on the side of the laptop for privacy.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption><em>If only the whole laptop could be decked out in this carbon fiber</em>.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Lenovo</cite></span></p></section><p>The laptop itself has a pretty unique look thanks to its carbon fiber lid. Lenovo says each Legion 9i’s lid is made from eight layers of carbon fiber, making it “lighter and stronger than aluminum.” But any weight savings aside, the coolest aspect of this carbon fiber creation is the visible pattern on the lid — which Lenovo says is slightly different and one-of-a-kind on each unit.</p><p>We may not know how much the Legion 9i costs just yet, but that lid instantly makes it one of the most interesting jumbo-sized gaming laptops in my book. At least, as far as ones not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">adorned with dragons</a> go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Today, 8th May, is a day of compound darkness, for it sees the release of (at least) two games with "midnight" in the title: Midnight Special from Scared Stupid Inc, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from Moonhood. A coincidence? Absolutely not. This is clearly an occult configuration of daunting power. It's also an opportunity to briefly compare two video game aesthetics, each comparably dense, tasty and insidious.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Midnight Walk is from them wot did animal fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fe">Fe</a>, which I appreciated but did not much enjoy, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>. It casts you as a cindery explorer, The Burnt One, who must help a chibi lantern bro called Potboy through a beautifully unpleasant world of gouged and shrunken clay surfaces and twitchy, stop-motion-style creatures. "Survive and outsmart the many monsters eager to devour your little friend's flame as you experience five tales of fire and darkness, featuring an incredible cast of odd characters," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">the Steam page</a> comments.
</p>

<p>
It's a first-person "dark adventure" with an emphasis on puzzling and using your noodle, but it does feature guns - hunky plasticene blunderbusses that wouldn't seem out of place in Doom, except that you appear to be very small in The Midnight Walk, small enough to sit on Doomguy's knuckle, wield a matchstick like a torch, or shelter beneath the pages of a dropped book. The world is perhaps more of a hive: you'll meet dreadful insects with hinged facemasks. I find it all quite appealing, though the stop-motion craftsmanship here feels quite sheeny and varnished next to the purposefully ramshackle splendour of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a>.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Special is another keg of giblets entirely. It's a horror point-and-clicker that takes inspiration from 16-bit adventure games together with various cinematic movements and genres: "the gory thrills of giallo, the suspense of slashers, and the otherworldly charm of 70s and 80s sci-fi". The year is 1978, the place is somewhere in Maine, and you are a babysitter exploring a labyrinthine manor. It's a game of four episodes: today's early access release nets you the Pilot episode encompassing "the first half of the house", though there's currently a free Prologue demo as well.

<p>
It seems less of an enclosed dark fantasy, and more openly steeped in the material culture of various periods than The Midnight Walk. There are nods to Steamboat Willy and older Macintosh desktop displays, for example. It's also bloodier and I think, more horrible in how it couples smearier bits of pixellation with the torments of the flesh. Still, at least there are no flap-faced Burtonesque spiders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/">You can read more on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please choose one of these games for further consideration and possibly, a purchase. I advise you not to play both, for there can only be <em>one</em> midnight. What dire cosmic consequences will you unleash, if you conjure the sunset twice over and investigate these elaborate, storied and allusive visual artefacts side by side? Don't come crying to me in the comments if tomorrow never dawns.

<p>Meanwhile, the Counter-Strike 2 team has done a fair bit of rework with the game's maps. It has removed the following community maps from all game modes as part of this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basalt</li>
<li>Edin</li>
<li>Palais</li>
<li>Whistle</li>
</ul>
<p>It has also added three community maps to its Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch modes. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jura</li>
<li>Grail</li>
<li>Agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, two maps have been added to Wingman mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogtown</li>
<li>Brewery</li>
</ul>
<p>Sticking with maps, the team has also rejigged the game's Casual and Deathmatch map groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defusal Group Alpha: Dust 2, Mirage, Inferno, Vertigo.</li>
<li>Defusal Group Delta: Train, Anubis, Ancient, Overpass, Nuke.</li>
<li>Community Map Group: Jura, Grail, Agency.</li>
<li>Hostage Group: Office, Italy.</li>

<p>Last year, Will Judd asked the question: If Counter-Strike is so good, why did it take 24 years to make Counter-Strike 2?</p>
<p>"Counter-Strike 2 <em>is </em>Counter-Strike. The formula hasn't really changed since the 1999 original - terrorists and counter-terrorists sparring to eliminate the other side or plant/defuse a bomb at one of two designated locations - but Valve's 2023 release runs better on modern hardware than 2012's Global Offensive and offers sparingly more gameplay possibilities too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-review-despite-everything-its-still-you">Eurogamer's Counter-Strike 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally though, the core combination of tactical, round-based 5v5 competition and satisfyingly difficult shooting mechanics remain as enrapturing and enraging as ever."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has announced that there will be a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach limited edition DualSense controller, with pre-orders for it going live on May 22nd. The price for the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach limited edition DualSense has been set at $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480, with it being available directly from PlayStation. You can see pictures of the Dualsense below, including one of Hideo Kojima posing with one.</p>

		
		

<p>Sony has said that the pre-orders will be live from 10am ET in the U.S., and 10am local time in the U.K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Once the page goes live you will be able to order it from <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/">PlayStation Direct</a>, as well as participating retailers. The controller will be released on June 26th, which is also the release date for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Ordering through PlayStation directly will also net you free delivery.</p>


<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">Death Stranding PC review</a>, which came in 2020. For this release, Miguel said: “It’s a story well worth revisiting or experiencing for the first time on PC. The pacing of the game can certainly drag to a screeching halt through the middle, but with boosted frame rate and crisper visuals, you’ll likely be too mesmerised by the hauntingly gorgeous world of Hideo Kojima’s latest masterpiece to even care about the uneven story beats.”</p>

			<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an update on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, or rather, not on the lawsuit itself, which is still ongoing, but on its impacts on the game. The developer has had to introduce some changes due to the lawsuit, as detailed below:</p>
<p><em>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</em></p>
<p><em>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</em><br>
<em>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo is invoking patent infringement, but Pocketpair alleges that at least some of those patents were filed after the release of their game. We'll keep you updated with any major updates to the lawsuit involving one of the biggest games of 2024.</p>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has forecast global sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles by the end of March 2026, which would be roughly comparable to the original Switch’s first year on sale, despite retailing for a much higher price. The company suffered an expected slump in both hardware and software sales this year, according to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf">latest earnings release</a>, and will be hoping for a bumper year ahead.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5th, so will have 10 months on sale to hit that forecast, with Nintendo also expecting to sell 45 million Switch 2 games in the same period. It’s not written its older console off though, and is expecting to shift another 4.5 million Switch consoles and over 100 million games in the year ahead, down from 10.8 million and 155 million of each last year.</p><p>The first Switch launched in March 2017, at the tail end of a fiscal year, so direct sales comparisons are tricky. It <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 17.79 million units worldwide</a> in its first 13 months on sale — comfortably more than Nintendo’s forecasts at the time — so Nintendo is expecting sales in the same ballpark this time around. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to overtaking the DS</a> as Nintendo’s bestselling console ever.</p><p>Nintendo might be hedging its Switch 2 sales estimate, however, given the uncertainties with tariffs in the all-important US market. We’ve already seen that Switch 2 demand is higher than the company may have expected, despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">widespread complaints about the $449.99 price tag</a>. When US preorders finally began — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delayed in the wake of Trump’s tariffs</a>, amid fears that the price would climb even higher — they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">sold out almost immediately</a>. Meanwhile the company put out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">supply warning in Japan</a> after receiving 2.2 million applications for preorders, which Nintendo said “far exceeds our expectations.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At least, that's what characters in the open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will tell you, before selling you a spell that lets you raise skellingtons from the dirt. You can be promoted to the head of the Mages Guild, in spite of all those corpses you keep bringing back to life. Necromancy banned? Seems like no one cares.</p>
<p>Well, one modder has fixed that. The mod, simply titled <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1188">"Necromancy Is Actually Banned"</a>, will see you expelled from the Mages Guild if you perform any necrotic abracadabras in sight of a fellow member. You can also get fined by the guards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Necromancy has been banned by the Mages Guild yet nobody cares if you use undead summons. This mod fixes that," reads a description for the mod on Nexus Mods. "In addition, while not illegal in the lore, optionally you can choose to have summoning undead result in a 100-gold bounty if done near a guard. This makes Necromancy feel like something you really need to hide."</p>
<p>The mod adds one other touch to make necromancy feel more like an underground act of scumbaggery. Spells that let you summon the undead can no longer be bought from Mages Guild vendors, but you'll still find them sold by other, less reputable, magic users (hello <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Shady_Sam">Shady Sam</a>, one tome of Headless Zombie, please). Or you can find them on necromancer corpses. Which I'm sure you won't reanimate - it's illegal. </p>
<p>Considering a lot of righteous quests involve hunting down necromancers and zombie-raising ill-doers, there is definitely a sense that this practice is seen as disgusting, immoral, and wrong in the Elder Scrolls world. That so few characters care if you do it near them is arguably just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">one of Oblivion's silly charms</a>, like becoming so good at crouching it renders you immediately invisible in broad daylight. But it's nice to have a mod that makes characters react in the way you might expect. </p>
<p>You will need to use another mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> to make certain changes to character dialogue work with this one, though, says the creator of the necromod "MadAborModding". </p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil," a random NPC will often tell you in Oblivion, "but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the Mages Guild has banned it." At least now, with this mod, that statement will feel a little more accurate. Modding for the Oblivion Remastered has not received any official support, but it's booming nonetheless, with nearly 2000 mods uploaded to Nexus Mods so far. Even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/some-old-mods-from-2008-still-work-in-oblivion-remastered">old mods for the original 2008 game still work</a>.

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is less than two months from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned release date</a>. As part of a media blast, creator Hideo Kojima was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/death-stranding-2-an-interview-with-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by the PlayStation Blog</a>, revealing more details about the sequel. For instance, the upcoming game will provide players with more choice and freedom in comparison to the previous installment.</p>
<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was designed with a similar philosophy. Players familiarized themselves with the ‘delivery game’ genre with the first game, and the sequel builds on that and provides players with more choice and freedom, particularly around combat; you can go in guns blazing, or you can choose not to use weapons at all. We also made cars and motorcycles more accessible.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the story, the predecessor was centred around Sam and Cliff. This time, the story delves deeper into who Lou is, her relationship with Sam, as well as Sam’s backstory.</em></p>
<p>Kojima then talked about the choice of setting (Mexico and Australia):</p>
<p><em>Mexico shares a border with the UCA (United Cities of America), so the neighboring cities had to be connected. As Sam mentions many times in the game, we were extremely mindful that building these ‘connections’ didn’t appear invasive. Sam’s journey of connecting the Americas from east to west was inspired by the American frontier. With the UCA established, we wanted the sequel to take place in a location that shared a similar geography with the Americas — stretches from east to west and borders the sea in the north and south. Eurasia is too large, and Africa didn’t really fit the bill either. Australia checked all the boxes, but the next issue we faced was how to connect the North American continent with Australia. After a lot of discussion, we decided to implement the ‘plate gate’ to connect the two continents.</em></p>
