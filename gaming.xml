		<p>The LittleBigPlanet series is coming to a sad and subdued end, it feels, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet-3">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and all the associated DLC are to be delisted from the PlayStation Store on 31st October.</p>
<p>The game will remain playable for anyone that owns the game and has the DLC, but online features have been disabled since the start of 2024, with user generated content inaccessible unless already downloaded and stored on a device.</p>



<p>What’s sad is that it’s bad actors that have ruined the fun of a thoroughly pleasant and beloved series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/13/littlebigplanet-3-servers-come-back-online-for-ps4-but-ps3-and-ps-vita-game-servers-to-be-shut-down/">The issues started back in 2021</a> when the game servers were hit by what was initially suspected to be a DDoS attack, with intermittent availability over the weeks that followed, as the team maintaining the game sought to implement security fixes. It reached a tipping point when hackers started to leverage their access to display custom error messages on players’ screens with transphobic messages, forcing Sony to take the servers offline while working on a fix. A fix was eventually released for LBP 3 on PS4 specifically and the series’ millions of UGC levels preserved, but the PS3 and handheld versions of the game were lost at that time. Things clearly broke down again this year, and Sony threw in the towel.</p>

<p>It’s not completely the end of the series – Sackboy: A Big Adventure is still for sale – but none of the mainline series of games is available on a current platform and all online servers are offline. There’s no sign or rumours that series creator MediaMolecule will return to LBP, or that Sony intends to partner with a third party like Sumo Digital again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-edition-of-warhammer-underworlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> has been announced. This means the skirmish-based spin-off of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer Age of Sigmar</a> </em>will experience major changes to its core gameplay. Changes that Games Workshop has been upfront in sharing.</p>
<h2>The Warhammer Underworlds Edition Changes</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qrtynnia/theres-a-new-edition-of-warhammer-underworlds-coming-these-are-the-biggest-rules-changes/">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop illustrates the changes coming in the newest edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-warband-warscroll-screenshot.jpg?itok=RYZ2RHcV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-warband-warscroll-screenshot.jpg?itok=nrOOKgv0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first major change regards your Warband and their Fighter Cards. A new stat has been added called Bounty. This determines how much Glory you gain by killing a certain unit. In addition, decks are universal; any unique abilities a Warband has is defined by their Warband Warscroll.</p>
<p>Among these updated Warscrolls is a new mechanic called Warband Abilities. Some can be activated every round. For example, the Emberwatch has Alone I Stand!, which allows you to push a friendly fighter one hex. Others are potent, once-per-battle abilities with various trigger conditions.</p>
<p>This includes the Emberwatch's Deadly Sentries ability. After your unit picks a weapon as part of an attack you can choose to give it +1 Range for that attack.</p>
<p>Movement in <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> will remain unchanged in this new edition. But alongside the Move, Attack, Charge, and Guard action, there is now the Focus action.</p>
<p>Focus is designed to give you an out if you don't have a card to play, referred to as "bricked hands" by the community. If you Focus, you discard your entire hand and draw a replacement for each card discarded, and an additional Power card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-underdog-card-artwork.jpg?itok=DZ0DOxU2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-underdog-card-artwork.jpg?itok=W1K_ZnIL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's a strong move with a cost. If you use it too often, you won't have enough Glory to score or Power Cards to play.</p>
<p>For fans of the latest edition of <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>, the Underdog mechanic will be coming to <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em>.&nbsp; The Underdog is whoever has fewer Glory. Underdogs win ties during first turn roll-offs in battle rounds two and three, and gains access to new abilities like more healing rolls are being able to redeploy fighters without using the Move action.</p>
<p>Lastly, a game of Warhammer Underworlds are fought only one board. According to Games Workshop, this was done to make combat faster and streamline game set-up. The new game boards will be made more compact with streamlined game language.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-cross-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-diablo-4-cross-platform-or-are-you-limited-to-your-system%E2%80%99s-players.1004385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-cross-platform/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the immense and seemingly continuously rising popularity of Diablo 4, especially after the launch of Vessel of Hatred and the massive 2.0 launch, along with the ARPG being available on most modern platforms, the gaming community surrounding the title continues expanding. But even so, sometimes you want to play with a friend or family member who doesn’t own the same system as you. Thankfully, you have options. So, is Diablo 4 cross-platform? How about cross-progression? Heck, let’s even dive in and figure out if the ARPG offers couch co-op!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-diablo-4-cross-platform">Can You Play Diablo 4 Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>Diablo 4 does offer full cross-platform functionality. If you play on PC, you can connect with those on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S to form a dungeon party or tackle a world boss together without ruining the experience whatsoever. There’s minimal to zero lag during gameplay, and I’ve personally experienced zero issues playing with others between PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-diablo-4-support-cross-progression">Does Diablo 4 Support Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>Diablo 4 requires you to connect to the game servers via Battle.net; all of your progress is saved in the cloud, allowing you to progress on the same character and even transfer cosmetics bought via the in-game shop to any system you play on. If you purchase the game on PC, as many of us did, and then decide to download the Xbox Game Pass version on Xbox Series X|S, you’ll find your characters waiting for you, ready to dive back into Sanctuary!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-diablo-4-couch-co-op">Is Diablo 4 Couch Co-op?</h2>



<p>There’s good and bad news regarding couch co-op in Diablo 4. It’s available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One, but not on PC. For whatever reason, the studio could not get split-screen multiplayer functional on the PC version of Diablo 4, but they managed two-player couch co-op on consoles. Numerous bugs and glitches on PC prevented the mechanic from working correctly, so we’re missing out.</p>



<p>Where do you play Diablo 4? Let us know in the comments below, or join the discussion on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our official community forums</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>Before you jump into the new expansion, Vessel of Hatred, you should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tackle a few tasks beforehand</a> to give you the best start!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/accused-switch-modder-represents-himself-as-nintendo-lawsuit-moves-forward/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When faced with a legal threat from Nintendo, most alleged <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/nintendo-issues-cease-and-desist-for-switch-modchip-installation-service/">modders</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/former-rom-site-owner-must-pay-2-1-million-to-nintendo/">ROM pirates</a>, and/or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/switch-emulator-ryujinx-shuts-down-development-after-contact-by-nintendo/">emulator makers</a> will simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-sends-cease-and-desist-notice-to-pokemon-rom-hacker/">give in to a cease-and-desist demand</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">reach an out of court settlement</a>, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/hacker-will-pay-nintendo-4-5-million-in-team-xecuter-plea-bargain/">plead guilty</a> rather than hiring legal representation for what could be a lengthy, costly trial. Then there's Ryan Daly, alleged owner of ModdedHardware.com,&nbsp;who has apparently decided to represent himself as a recent lawsuit brought against him by the Switch maker moves forward.</p>
<p>Nintendo says it first approached Daly in March about his site (currently password-protected but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504061109/https://www.moddedhardware.com/">archived here</a>) and its sales of modded Switch consoles, console modding services, and piracy-enabling devices such as the MIG Switch card that were pre-installed with popular Nintendo games. At that time, Daly agreed "both verbally and in signed writing" to refrain from these infringing sales, according to Nintendo. It was only after months of Daly continuing those sales and largely ignoring further contact from Nintendo that the company says it was forced to file <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/nintendo-modded.pdf">its June lawsuit</a> in a Seattle federal court.</p>
<p>In that initial lawsuit, Nintendo said it "received a communication from a lawyer purporting to represent [Daly]" in June, followed by a message days later that Daly "was in the process of obtaining new counsel." That search for new counsel has seemingly not moved forward, as last week Daly <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/daly-response.pdf">filed a pro se response</a> to Nintendo's allegations, representing himself without any outside legal advice (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">TorrentFreak</a>).</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Demon's Souls celebrated its 15-year anniversary on October 6, 2024. Below, we examine how the progenitor of the Soulslike genre forged an uncompromising path for others to follow.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Die-hard From Software fans who've dodge-rolled their way through the fiery crucibles of Elden Ring and the Dark Souls series certainly know a thing or two about the origins of the so-called souls-like genre. Defined by a number of discrete pillars--"bonfire"-style checkpoints that restore a set number of heals, stamina meters, and menacing bosses--this style of game has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years. Moreover, these design tropes have crystallized into hard-and-fast principles that notable games like Lies of P seem to embrace wholeheartedly.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you look at the first entry in the Souls series, the wildly innovative Demon's Souls, you'll find a game that bucks many notions that these newer games take for granted. Instead, it employs many byzantine and downright hostile design ideas that not only chafe against traditional notions of "fun," but the ideals of frictionless gameplay and player empowerment that have increasingly crept into the souls-like space in recent years. The sharp edges of Demon's Souls (and, to a lesser extent, Dark Souls) are as much a part of the series' success as its satisfying combat and intriguing lore, and it'll be interesting to see if From Soft ever returns to that mindset in the coming years.</p><p dir="ltr">Demon's Souls makes no effort to hide its unyielding nature: Its opening tutorial throws you into an intimidating boss fight against a mammoth foe who (almost certainly) stomps you flat and robs you of half your health bar, with no rematch available anytime soon. Of Demon's Souls' many peculiarities, this distinction between "Human Form" and half-health "Soul Form" is perhaps the best known, its existence serving as a sort of thesis statement for the game as a whole. But as many players learned firsthand when they dived into Bluepoint's 2020 PS5 remake, that's only the beginning.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="13434156" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

tempting to point to the infamous "Character Tendency" and "Level Tendency" systems in Demon's Souls as the ultimate examples of these sharp edges. Ostensibly intended to reflect the player character's moral standing, these two systems fall within a spectrum of "pure white" to "pure black," with many shades in between. Bound by a number of confusing rules that even veterans struggle to remember at times, these two mostly invisible markers have a surprising impact on many aspects of the experience. For example, worlds leaning towards a white tendency have weakened enemies, and you deal more damage to them, whereas blackened enemies hit harder and give you more Souls.</p><p dir="ltr">What's most galling about these dual mechanics is that their effects are not confined to the margins; several of Demon's Souls' best quests, NPCs, and weapons are locked behind Tendency gates and events. This forces you to pay attention to these cryptic indicators and experiment to learn more about them. For example, impassable gates with tempting loot behind them tend to mysteriously disappear at extreme Tendencies, leading to new paths to explore. Each level has a special NPC who appears at both ends of the spectrum in different forms, with distinct rewards for each.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's fair to say that many modern players rely on wiki entries and guides to navigate these unique elements years later, it's important to remember that those who first played Demon's Souls didn't have that option. If you wanted to get the impressively blunt Dragon Bone Smasher that an invader killed you with that one time, a poorly translated Japanese guide might tell you that you need pure white World Tendency in a certain level, but how to get there was a matter of contradictory rumors and innuendo. (For those without the patience to try to figure this out, the original PS3 Demon's Souls occasionally set the World Tendencies a certain way for holidays like Christmas and Halloween, but such opportunities were rare.)</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond Tendency, Demon's Souls' unforgiving nature is sewn into almost every facet of its design, even seemingly minor details. It's the only game in the Souls series to feature an item-encumbrance system, and if you accidentally pick up some loot you don't have room for, you'll have to drop pieces in your inventory to make space--those that are dropped despawn after you leave and can easily be lost forever. (Thankfully for some, this was fixed in the remake.) The game's lengthy levels feature few shortcuts and long boss run-backs, making every death a matter of minutes lost.</p><p dir="ltr">You don't have to look far to find examples of this sort of player hostility in the original Dark Souls. That game's complex Humanity system can be read as a successor to the downright inscrutable Tendency ideas of its predecessor, and the dreaded basilisk's curse you might encounter in the depths of Blighttown cruelly halves your HP. (The original incarnation of this mechanic was even more devious, as the curses could stack, halving your HP again and again to the point where a single swipe from a skeleton could kill you. Naturally, this was eventually patched out.)</p><p dir="ltr">Even Dark Souls 2's confusing Bonfire Ascetic system and limited enemy respawns reflect the deliciously inscrutable and uncaring design ethos of Demon's Souls to an extent, but that's arguably where that approach starts to die out. By contrast, Elden Ring's massive world is sown with secrets to find and lore to analyze, but it rarely challenges the player to truly figure things out for themselves beyond simple environmental puzzles. Yes, From Soft's most recent games are harder than ever, but their vision of difficulty has fundamentally shifted over the years. Where Dark Souls once challenged players to muddle their way through a crumbled world beyond their understanding--including in terms of game mechanics--Elden Ring throws in barrel-rolling light-show superbosses that take hours and hours to master.</p><p dir="ltr">Demon's Souls is not for everyone. Like many innovative games, it sacrifices universal appeal for an experience that is equal parts baffling, endearing, and downright clunky. As the prototype for a distinct style of game that has slowly congealed into its own subgenre, it feels strangely alien to those who have played many souls-likes that follow the seemingly sacred Dark Souls formula. Since From Software has grown in both size and audience over the years, it would seem difficult for the studio to harness the experimental approach that produced its greatest hit. However, when you look at the trajectory of the studio's games, such a shift seems inevitable. It's difficult to imagine a Souls-style game with a bigger world than The Lands Between or a harder boss than the final foe of Shadow of the Erdtree, but you certainly can't stop it from trying. To live up to its legacy as the one of the greatest developers in gaming, From Software's next path will have to be something that's challenging in an entirely new way; and in that way, it will continue the true legacy of Demon's Souls, the game that started it all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hotel Barcelona, the side-scrolling slasher movie parody from wonderfully oddball designers Goichi "Suda51" Suda and Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro and Swery, has been delayed from 2024 into next year so develoepr White Owls can "keep polishing it and making it better".
</p>
<p>
Suda51 (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a>, Shadows of the Damned) and Swery (Deadly Premonition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-good-life">The Good Life</a>) shared a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-hotel-barcelona-a-horror-themed-side-scroller-from-swery-and-suda51">first look at Hotel Barcelona</a> last year, unveiling a game in which renowned serial killers from all over the US descend on the titular Pittsburgh hotel for reasons not entirely clear.
</p>
<p>
Motives probably aren't a priority, however, when dealing with a game whose novice federal marshal protagonist Justine also happens to have an insane serial killer named Dr. Carnival living inside of her. "Will she be able to exterminate all the evil serial killers and escape from this cursed hotel?!," asks its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/">Steam page</a>, "Find out in this 2.5D slasher film parody action game!"

<p>
Justine's journey takes her across seven locations (each inspired by a different horror movie and overseen by its own serial killer boss) packed with enemies she'll need to slaughter in order to remain bathed in blood and increase the power of her skills. And if that wasn't wild enough, each time Justine dies and revives, she'll be fighting alongside a new Slasher Phantom - ghost versions of her previous attempts who'll deal damage and act as decoys.
</p><p>
All this was originally due to arrive this year, but with time running out for a 2024 release, <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/hotel-barcelona-slightly-delayed-maybe-ai-will-port-it-to-switch-1441313/">Gamereactor</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hotel-barcelona-has-been-delayed-to-next-year/">VGC</a>) asked Swery where Hotel Barcelona had got to during the recent IndieDevDay. "Right now," Swery explained, "we're bug checking the game and we want to keep polishing it and making it better. But ideally, we want to release the game in early 2025".
</p>
<p>
Hotel Barcelona is due to release simultaneously on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 whenever it eventually shows up, but a Nintendo version apparently isn't on the cards right now. "In the distant future," Swery joked, "maybe AI will port it to Switch for me".

			<p>WB Games Montreal is reportedly working on a new DC Comics game. A <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/jobs/r000085749/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3_t9JnHabk1U9HUAfChMB_jfoMoBnXSjRgdZkq22JxMrzlVBoK38ifnBU_aem_f7-dwYdH8yYWRm7zPmTy8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job listing</a> for a Senior Producer was uploaded, with the text saying that they are looking for someone to join "its Game Development team, working on AAA titles set in the DC Comics Universe." However, that part of the text was removed, and it now just talks about working for the WB Games Montreal division of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The entire job description was posted on Reddit, but some of the text has since changed on the official website. A screenshot of the <a href="https://x.com/Jsig212James/status/1843680988733551090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original text was posted on X</a> by a user named James Sigfield.</p>
<p>It was also uploaded to the WB website, and it was also caught on LinkedIn, which described the roles of the job, including helping oversee "all phases and teams of development of a single project, from the concept phase through its release." From the sound of the job description and the responsibilities that they are asking for, it seems as if the project is in very early development.</p>
<p>Whoever gets the job will be asked to create a milestone roadmap, as well as deliver the milestones "from concept to ship" as well as helping to manage the production budget for the title. WB Montreal has made some very well-known games in the DC universe, such as Batman: Arkham Origins as well as the more recent Gotham Knights. 2024 saw the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, but the game received middle-ground reviews from critics but overwhelmingly negative reviews from consumers due to the game being full of bugs and server issues.</p>
<p>Looking at the Wikipedia page for the game studio also suggests that a new DC Comics game is in the works, as it's listed that the game is TBA but that the game is in production using Unreal Engine 5. Whether this is true remains to be seen and likely will not be confirmed until the game is announced or until Warner Bros. makes a statement about the information. However, considering that they scrubbed the text to remove the DC Comics segment from the job description, it seems unlikely that they would publicly come out and provide any information about the Senior Producer role or whether they are actually making a game in the DC Games universe.</p>

I love how Gallica, my fairy companion, sits on my shoulder as I walk through the streets of its fantasy setting. I enjoy reading all the chatter that pops up from the citizens as I make my way from one side of a city to the other. <em>Metaphor </em>isn’t an open-world game, but its towns are still decently sized and take a minute to get around on foot. Sure, you can fast-travel and miss out on all the ambient dialogue, but if you do that, you’re denying yourself one of the greatest simple pleasures of the game: skating around on your sword.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,193583,196578" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yeah, swords aren’t just for swiping, slashing, and stabbing in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. They can also be made into a magical, floating skateboard. Doing so gives you a boost in speed as you traverse the giant cities and small villages of the United Kingdom of Euchronia. But it also gives you some special dialogue from onlookers as you zoom past them. Some will remark in awe as they’ve never seen a sharp blade turn into a skateboard before. Others will choose not to mind their own business and claim that you’re trying to get attention and disrupt the peace. It turns out that being weird and annoying to the youth trying to skateboard is another part of the real world <em>Metaphor</em> manages to capture in its fantasy universe.<br></p><p>While the protagonist of <em>Metaphor </em>can use different weapons depending on which Archetype or class they’re using, the skate-sword is a mainstay when you’re running around civilized areas. This makes some sense, because if you were playing as the Gunner Archetype, skating on a floating crossbow doesn’t sound practical. But I do wish it were possible to skate in some of the wild areas and dungeons you come across throughout <em>Metaphor</em>’s 80 or so hours. Though you of course need your weapon in hand in those areas so you can stab or shoot an enemy as they approach, but it sure would make some of the backtracking you have to do in later dungeons a bit breezier.</p><p>As I reflect on my time with <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, it still strikes me how much Atlus was able to adapt <em>Persona</em>’s formulas but still iterate on them meaningfully when moving to a fantasy setting. While I walked through the alleys and streets of Tokyo in <em>Persona 5</em>, I always felt like my own two feet were enough to get me where I needed to go. But <em>Metaphor</em>’s world feels bigger than these discrete slices of the real ones, and so it’s only natural that we need a new way to move through it. The skate-sword may look a little silly out of context, and maybe more whimsical than fitting for the dark political drama of the rest of the game, but it is one of the biggest quality-of-life changes Atlus could have made for <em>Metaphor</em>. When you play the game on October 11, get in the habit of whipping it out every time you’re in its cities. There’s no drawback, and you’re walking around enough.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One way to navigate a massive sale like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime's Big Deal Days</a> is to shop for the really cheap stuff like $5 Blu-rays and $10 video games. Another way is to find a deal on something expensive that you've been eyeing for a while, like a top-of-the-line 65-inch OLED TV, and finally take the plunge. As you can probably guess from the headline, this article is about the latter sort of deal--Amazon has major markdowns on Sony Bravia televisions and accompanying sound systems during its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales event.

			<p>Today, on the <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1843652568389480651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleBigPlanet X account</a>, an announcement was posted regarding the future of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/littlebigplanet-3-review-sackboy-friends-create-wonderful-memory/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and LittleBigPlanet DLC on the PlayStation Store.&nbsp; Created by Media Molecule, LittleBigPlanet was developed by Media Molecule, with the first game being released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3. In total, there have been six games in the franchise, with the latest main installment being titled Sackboy: A Big Adventure. However, with this announcement being posted on X, it seems that LittleBigPlanet may be no more. This post explains that this is the last chance for people to purchase LittleBigPlanet 3 and the DLC from the PlayStation Store. LittleBigPlanet 3 has been available for ten years, and now it seems that it is time for the game and all LBP DLC to be removed from the PlayStation Store as of October 31, 2024.</p>
<p>While the game is being delisted as of October 31, those who own the game as a physical or digital copy will still be able to access the content of the game. The announcement was listed so that those who haven't obtained the game yet are still able to access the game, with this as a final reminder. Whether this means that the servers will still be up is uncertain at the moment, but considering the servers for most previous games in the franchise have been closed down over the years, it seems likely that LittleBigPlanet 3 will follow suit.</p>
<p>As it stands, none of the LittleBigPlanet games are available to purchase digitally anymore, as they have all been delisted from the PlayStation Store, with LittleBigPlanet 3 being the last to go. Fans are in uproar about this, as it feels as if "years of DLC and community are getting erased," as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/reminder-little-big-planet-3-all-dlc-will-be-delisted-on-oct-31st-2024.1003713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one person comments</a> in response to a thread on Resetera.</p>
<p>Although the statement is worded in such a way by saying "friendly reminder" to purchase the game before it's gone forever, this is the only reminder that those who are fans of the franchise have been given, and it's less than a month's notice for people to purchase the game. It's likely that people who want it would be able to buy it cheaper as a physical copy from retailers still selling it or in thrift stores, but those who are using a digital-only console will be out of luck.</p>
<p>Additionally, October is a very stacked month for games, and in a time of financial crisis across the globe, it's going to be hard for people to decide whether they will choose to purchase a game before it's gone forever or choose to buy a game that has come out recently so that they can be in line with others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/learning-how-to-emote-in-diablo-4-could-reward-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several quests across Sanctuary, including one in Kyovashad, task you with utilizing an emote in Diablo 4 to cheer on guardsmen, interact with chests, or summon spirits at an altar. On top of the quest-specific goals, the emote wheel also allows you to connect with other players, chanting a class-specific greeting or challenging them to PvP. Here’s how to use the emote wheel in Diablo 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-emotes-in-diablo-4">How to Use Emotes in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>To use the emote wheel in Diablo 4, press either ‘<strong>Up</strong>‘ on the d-pad of your controller or ‘<strong>E</strong>‘ on the keyboard to access the wheel. From there, you can sort through three separate tabs of the wheel, with each holding eight total emotes. There are some you cannot swap out, however. For example, you’ll want to ensure you have Zoom, Leave Dungeon, Invite to Party, and Invite to Trade readily available on the wheel’s first tab so they’re easily accessible. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can customize the available emotes by opening the wheel and selecting “Customize” using the prompt below the emote wheel on the right-hand side. From there, it will open a new menu in which all your available emotes appear in a scrolling menu, which you may then add to the wheel.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-new-emotes-in-diablo-4">How to Unlock New Emotes in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various questlines and seasonal objectives in Diablo 4, you will inevitably unlock new emotes. The best way to earn new emotes is to complete the game’s season. The battle pass contains a handful of unique, sometimes class-specific, emotes that unlock once you level up far enough. However, many will only become available once you buy the premium pass, which costs real-world money to unlock.</p>



<p>Furthermore, some of the game’s quests and content will unlock emotes as rewards, so don’t forget to play through everything available!</p>



<p>How are you enjoying the brand-new season of Diablo 4 and its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred? Let us know in the comments below, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a> to start the discussion!</p>

<p>Can you believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-has-made-over-1-billion-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 has made over $1 billion dollars in revenue</a> already? It’s all thanks to that cosmetic in-game shop and its egregious pricing, but I’m guilty of decking out my Barbarian in unique cosmetics, too.</p>

                <p>The Last of Us has a reputation as being one of the best video game series of all time for many reasons. You have to do a lot of different things right to earn that sort of lasting acclaim--there's no "one weird trick" to success. But one of the key factors is certainly the original score by Gustavo Santaolalla, who won consecutive Oscars in 2006 and 2007 for his compositions for Brokeback Mountain and Babel. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sales event</a>, you can save big on this huge vinyl box set of Santaolalla's music from both The Last of Us games.</p><div title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2727" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box\/dp\/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box\/dp\/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$76 (was $110)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This expansive set includes eight discs of music from both the original game and its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, by composer Gustavo Santaolalla, with packaging and sleeves adorned with very striking art by Ashraf Omar.

It worked so well, in fact, that Santaolalla also composed the music for the HBO series.</p><p>Speaking of which, the 4K Blu-ray for Season 1 of HBO's The Last of Us, starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay, is also on sale for Prime Big Deal Days for just $21, down from its list price of $45--pretty good for eight hours of TV.</p><p>There are many, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>many</em> other deals to peruse during Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event</a>, though you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to participate. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sign up here</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> is heading to PS4 and Xbox One on 24th October, following its launch in 2022 across current consoles and PC.</p>
<p>The release will include the base game, all free content updates, and the Multiverse of Nonsense DLC.</p>
<p>What's more, it has cross-ownership integration meaning existing owners on current consoles can play on the equivalent previous console. However, only Xbox has cross-save integration too.</p>

<p>Goat Simulator 3 will also feature local two-player splitscreen, and two-player online multiplayer (on the same platform).</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to be able to give PS4 and Xbox One players access to our baa-rilliant game," said Santiago Ferrero, creative director at Coffee Stain North. "With 8th generation consoles joining the party, Goat Simulator 3 will now be available on 8 different platforms… As the kids would say, we really 'ate' with this announcement – they do still say that, right?"</p>
<p>In more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> news, the remaster of the first game will be released on 7th November.</p>
<p>Goat Simulator: Remastered will launch across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S over a decade after the original release. It will come with improved graphics, a re-worked mutator menu, and all DLC.</p>
<p>"You've waited 10 years, now we ask that you wait just one more month," said Joel Rydholm, producer at Coffee Stain Publishing in yet another tongue in cheek comment. "Goat Simulator: Remastered is going to knock your socks (hooves?) off, and we promise it'll probably be worth the wait. We're so excited to see what our fans think!"</p>
<p>Goat Simulator 3 was notable for its announcement trailer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-takes-down-goat-simulator-3-ad-that-used-leaked-gta-6-footage">incorporated leaked footage from GTA 6</a> - publisher Take-Two soon issued a take-down notice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
