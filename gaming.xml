                <p dir="ltr">It's more or less agreed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-0/" data-ref-id="5000-295563">Yakuza 0</a> is really good--many will even say the best in the whole series. But with the Switch 2's launch lineup being somewhat sparse, Sega (and Nintendo, which has timed exclusivity on this edition) are likely hoping players want to complement their Mario Karting, Cyberpunk 2077ing, and Street Fighting with a hard-hitting open-world adventure. But is it worth it? It really depends.</p><p dir="ltr">At $50, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is cheaper than many of the other Switch 2 launch games, and there's a lot to do here between the lengthy, dual-protagonist narrative and the surprisingly involving minigames. You can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and that's not even taking into account the new content.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Switch 2's Yakuza 0 Director's Cut Is An Upgraded Version Aimed At Old And New Fans</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major difference is the addition of new voice and subtitle tracks. Your choice of voice actors is down to personal preference, but for me, the Japanese ones are too iconic to switch away from. Chinese and English voice tracks have been recorded for the entire game. If you're a series veteran, you'll also notice that the demo cinematic features the Japanese rock song "Bubble" by Shounan no Kaze--a song featured in the original Yakuza 0's Japanese release but excised overseas. It's back, it's rockin', and it sets the stage for a grand old time in 1988 Bubble Era Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">At the title screen, there's a mode selectable right off the bat: Red Light Raid, which has you and up to four online or offline companions beating up waves of hooligans for fun and profit. I was intrigued by this mode, hoping it might serve as a callback to classic multiplayer arcade brawlers--some of which were made by Sega itself. What I actually got was somewhat underwhelming: You pick a character out of a massive roster (many of which require a good amount of in-game cash to unlock) and take them into battle with up to four player- or CPU-controlled companions. You'll pick a challenge, fight wave after wave of enemies, sometimes encountering a boss fight, before dealing with a final boss. Finishing a challenge run earns you lots of sweet, sweet yen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751" data-ratio="0.56246961594555" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut looks on par with the original game on PS4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can do all the fun head-cracking, chest-smashing moves here as you can in the base game (though both Kiryu and Majima require you to pick one fighting style and stick with it). It's a way to play as characters who are otherwise uncontrollable in the base game, which is nice. But overall it feels undercooked: Characters vary wildly in usefulness, and the sessions can devolve into messy chaos, especially in dark settings and on the Switch 2's handheld mode. It's obvious this game's combat, which frequently takes place in narrow streets, corridors, and cluttered rooms, wasn't built for multiplayer originally—and it frequently feels crowded and hard to get your bearings even on more open arenas. There’s a mix of character models and moves mostly mashed together from this game and others in the series, including a lot of barely-seen NPCs. Still, if you can get your friend group together in a GameChat channel as you play, you'll have some fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphically, I didn't notice any major changes or upgrades compared to the PS4 original--the textures look mostly identical and the character models seem to be a 1:1 port, though the Switch 2 version does include 4K support.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752" data-ratio="0.56149732620321" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut adds five brand-new cutscenes to the game's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger selling points has been the addition of five brand-new cutscenes--almost a half-hour's worth. I got the impression that these new scenes were meant to give some additional screen time to characters who fell by the wayside in the original, along with additional screentime for the Kiryu and Nishikiyama duo. They’re certainly a nice addition, though how much you’ll get from them depends on how invested in the cast you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade--but the biggest elephant in the room is that the original Yakuza 0 has <em>frequently</em> gone on very deep discount on Steam and elsewhere; during some sales, you could pick this saga up for well under $10. Even at a lower-than-average price of $50, this poses the question: Do the additional cutscenes, voice/subtitle languages, and other extra content in Director's Cut make up for that big price hike? For me, no--I like this series a lot, but I'm not hungry enough for new Yakuza to want to pay a huge premium for some extras that ultimately don't add all <em>that</em> much. But if you can't get enough of that crime drama, English isn't your first language, or you just have to have an English or Chinese voice track, then go ahead and grab it--it's a fantastic time.</p>

                <p>Though Microsoft never announced an official Xbox handheld device, there were rumors about how such a device <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">might factor into the company's next-gen console plans</a>. Those plans are continuing to evolve, it seems, as a new report said Microsoft's own Xbox handheld is "essentially canceled."</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, citing insiders, said such a device is no longer going forward. This follows on from a report at the end of May that suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-pauses-development-on-xbox-handheld/1100-6531934/" data-ref-id="1100-6531934">plans for an Xbox handheld were sidelined.</a></p><p>The Verge's report added that Microsoft remains bullish on the idea of making "next-gen Xbox hardware," but perhaps not in the way people think. "We'll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SOKm9dDOSC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer alluded to a closer collaboration between PC and console in a recent <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox podcast interview.</a> "This is the tightest collaboration I've seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company," he said. Spencer also mentioned how Windows PC is an open platform and that he believes, if managed properly, a PC can be considered "as a game console."</p><p>While Microsoft may not develop its own dedicated gaming handheld device, the company is working with third-party devices like the recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Rog Ally handhelds from Asus.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on the company's plans for handheld devices going forward.</p><p>In February 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p>The new Xbox Rog Ally devices launch this holiday, but there is no word on pricing as of yet. The systems can play all types of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-pc-games-run-on-the-new-xbox-handheld/1100-6532289/" data-ref-id="1100-6532289">including PlayStation PC titles.</a></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is striding purposefully into the verdant splendour of summer with a new nature-loving expansion, which also happens to mark the return of fairies as a playable Sim-type.
</p>
<p>
In fact, for all its talk of the natural world, EA's Enchanted by Nature expansion reveal suggests fairies - last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s 2012 Supernatural expansion - are very much the focus this time around. Mother Nature, it seems, is recruiting Sims to swell her fairy ranks, and players that opt to heed her call will find their Sims graced with abilities enabling them to nurture plants, manipulate objects, change the moods of others, and more.
</p>
<p>
A wide range of wings, skin tones, ears, teeth, head accessories, glowing tattoos, and more are promised so players can create the fairy that suits their whims, and once that's taken care of, they've the option of following two distinct fairy paths. Harmonious Fairies are all about helping others find health and balance, while Discordant Fairy are the chaos gremlins of the fairy world, flitting around and making life just a little more more difficult for other Sims with their mischief.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The Sims 4 Enchanted by Nature reveal trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D-WpFCmvRA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Regardless of the path they choose, players will need to be mindful of their fairy Sim's specific needs: rather than food, fairies are sustained on the emotions of others, so you'll be hoovering up all sorts of feelings to avoid Emotional Starvation. On the upside, you get a special fairy WooHoo to impress the neighbours with, so there's that.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of neighbours, The Sims 4's Enchanted by Nature expansion features a new world in the form of Innisgreen, split into three distinct districts. The Coast of Adhmor is a peaceful seaside village, while Sprucederry Grove promises a "vibrant blend of friendly shops, cosy homes, and draping ivy that blur the line between civilisation and the natural world". Fairy focused players, meanwhile, will be wanting to make a beeline for the enchanted woodland sprawl of Everdew. One word of warning: luck is its own force in Innisgreen, and Sims choosing to live here will experience good, bad, and ordinary luck, impacting their career, love life, and more - so luck-modifying charms may come in handy.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, there's talk of new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic in the form of balance. Sim that fail to stay emotionally grounded will gradually grown imbalanced, which can make life a little trickier. They might, for instance, learn skills more slowly, and if their balance continues to deteriorate, they'll enter 'very imbalanced' territory, at which point they'll start developing Ailments like Emotional Void, Simoleon Fever, Sonic Sinuses, and Greenie Meanie - which makes them a better gardener, but really, really angry at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Sims struck with Ailments can get respite by crafting cures and elixirs using the new Apothecary Table. By foraging and gardening for new ingredients, players can follow treatment recipes producing "fantastical effects", and all this ties into the new Elixir Enthusiast Aspiration, and the Naturopath profession, enabling Sims to monetise their newfound Apothecary skills.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything EA has revealed so far. The Sims 4's Enchanted by Nature expansion launches for all platforms on 10th July, and costs £34.99/$39.99 USD. Players who purchase the expansion before 21st August get a couple of additional items, including the Lofty Leaf Pond, the glowing Mycena Lantern, and the Disguised Dwelling Fairy Home.

It’s also bigger than the OG Switch. But, like, <em>how much</em> bigger?</p><p>Okay, sure, we can check <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs" rel="sponsored">the</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs" rel="sponsored">specs</a> and see that the Switch 2 is half an inch (12.7mm) taller and 1.2 inches (30.48mm) wider than the original — and it’s 0.22 pounds (99.79 grams) heavier. But don’t just bark numbers at me! Nah, man, get that nerd math out of here. </p><p>What about vibes-wise? How much bigger does it <em>feel</em>?</p><p>We already know the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2#:~:text=Only%20one%20color%20option%3F">a whole lot less colorful</a> and fun-looking than the original, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2#:~:text=Krales%20/%20The%20Verge-,Ergonomics,-The%20original%20Switch">definitely not any more comfortable to use</a>, either. So how does it compare to the more lively-looking Switches that came before it? And how about other boring black boxes that have brought us years of joyous games? Well, to show you, I got my Switch 2 out along with its direct progenitors and some of its other ilk from the world of video games, and I took a bunch of pictures.</p><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-switch-oled-vs-original-switch"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Switch OLED vs. original Switch</strong></h2></p></div><p>First up, the most obvious comparison: the Switch 2, its Joy-Con 2 controllers, and its new dock versus its last-gen counterparts. Any Switch may seem compact compared to various PC handhelds flooding the market these days, especially a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">surfboard-like one</a> that still hasn’t come out yet, but seeing the Switch 2 next to an original launch-day Switch from 2017 makes me wonder how we ever got on with that dainty original. The OLED edition may not have been any more powerful, but its slightly larger screen did make a huge difference. And now, the Switch 2 is even bigger than that. Despite not being all that comfortable in handheld mode, this feels like the <em>right</em> size for a Switch.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->20</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Switch 2 flanked by the original launch Switch (right) and Switch OLED (left).</em></figcaption></span></p></section><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-other-handhelds"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. other handhelds</strong></h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2’s new stature may be a marked improvement, but Valve’s Steam Deck was bigger and comfier right out of the gate.

Perhaps BioWare learned a hard lesson by leaving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a></span> on a cliffhanger and didn’t want to repeat the same restriction. But <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t just wrap up its own story; it concludes several major threads dating back to <em>Origins</em>, which feels calculated and deliberate. If BioWare’s goal with <em>The Veilguard </em>was to bring almost everything to a definitive end, the thematic note on which it leaves this world acts as a closing graf concluding the series’ overarching thesis.</p><p>Ignoring the bigotry that has followed <em>The Veilguard </em>like a starving rat digging through trash, one of the most common criticisms I heard directed toward the game was that it lacked a certain thorny disposition that was prevalent in the first three games. Everyone in the titular party generally seems to like each other, there aren’t real ethical and philosophical conflicts between the group, and the spats that do arise are more akin to the arguments you probably get into with your best friends. It’s a new dynamic for the series. The Veilguard doesn’t feel like coworkers as the Inquisition did, nor the disparate group who barely tolerated each other that we followed in <em>Dragon Age II</em>. They’re friends who, despite coming from different backgrounds, factions, and places, are pretty much on the same page about what the world should be. They’re united by a common goal, sure, but at the core of each of their lived experiences is a desire for the world to be better. </p><figure id="" data-id="9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-recommend-id="image://9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-recommend-id="image://9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This rose-colored view of leftism doesn’t work for everyone. At its worst, <em>The Veilguard </em>can be so saccharine it’d cause a cavity, which is far from what people have come to expect from a series in which the mage-hating elf Fenris and pro-mage radical Anders didn’t care if the other lived or died. It also bleeds into a perceived softening of the universe. Factions like the Antivan Crows have essentially become the Bat Family from DC Comics, with no mention of the whole child slavery thing that was our first introduction to them back in <em>Origins</em>. The Lords of Fortune, a new pirate faction, go to great lengths to make sure you know that they’re not like the other pirates who steal from other cultures, among other things. I joked to a friend once that <em>The Veilguard </em>is a game terrified of getting canceled, and as such, a lot of the grit and grime has been washed off for something shiny and polished. </p><p>That is the more critical lens through which to view the way <em>The Veilguard</em>’s sanitation of Thedas. To an extent, I agree. We learned so much about how the enigmatic country of the Tevinter Imperium was a place built upon slavery and blood sacrifice, only for us to conveniently hang out in the common poverty-stricken areas that are affected by the corrupt politics we only hear about in sidequests and codex entries. But decisions like setting <em>The Veilguard</em>’s Tevinter stories in the slums of Dogtown give the game and its writers a place to make a more definitive statement, rather than existing in the often frustrating centrism <em>Dragon Age</em> loved to tout for three games.</p><p>I have a lot of pain points I can shout out in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but I don’t think anything has stuck in my craw more than the way the end of Anders’ antagonistic “Rivalry” relationship goes down in <em>Dragon Age II </em>if you don’t support his crusade to emancipate the mages from their captivity in the Circle of Magi. This is a tortured radical mage who is willing to give his life to fight for the freedom of those who have been born into a corrupt system led by the policing Templars. And yet, if you’ve followed his rivalry path, Anders will turn against the mages he, not five minutes ago, did some light terrorism trying to free. In <em>Inquisition</em>, this conflict of ideals and traditions comes to a head, but you’re able to essentially sweep it all under the rug as you absorb one faction or the other into your forces. So often, <em>Dragon Age </em>treats its conflicts and worldviews as toys for the player to slam against one another, shaping the world as they see fit, and bending even the most fiercely devoted radical to their whims. And yes, there are some notable exceptions to this rule, but when it came to world-shifting moments of change, <em>Dragon Age</em> always seemed scared to assert that the player might be wrong. Mages and Templars, oppressed and oppressors, were the same in the eyes of the game, each worthy of the same level of scrutiny.</p><figure id="" data-id="e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-recommend-id="image://e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-recommend-id="image://e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before <em>The Veilguard</em>, I often felt <em>Dragon Age </em>didn’t actually believe in anything. Its characters did, but as a text, <em>Dragon Age </em>often felt so preoccupied with empowering the player’s decisions that it felt like Thedas would never actually get better, no matter how much you fought for it. While it may lack the same prickly dynamics and the grey morality that became synonymous with the series, <em>The Veilguard</em> doesn’t just believe that the world is full of greys and let you pick which shade you’re more comfortable with. Of the entire series, it’s the most whole-hearted, full-throated declaration that the world of Thedas can be better than it was before.</p><p>Essentially retconning the Antivan Crows to a family of superheroes is taking a hammer to the problem, whereas characters like Neve Gallus, a mage private eye with a duty-bound love for her city and its people, are the scalpel with which BioWare carves its vision of how the world of Thedas can change. Taash explores their identity through the lens of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s longstanding Qunari culture, known for its rigidness in the face of an ever-changing world, and comes out the other end a new person, defined entirely by their own views and defying others. Harding discovers the truth behind how the dwarves were severed from magic, and still remembers that she believes in the good in people. The heroes of <em>The Veilguard </em>have seen the corruption win out, and yet never stop believing that something greater is possible. It’s not even an option in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s eyes. The downtrodden <em>will</em> be protected, the oppressed <em>will</em> live proudly, and those who have been wronged <em>will</em> find new life.</p><p>That belief is what makes <em>The Veilguard </em>a frustrating RPG, to some. It’s so unyielding in its belief that Thedas and everyone who inhabits it can be better that it doesn’t entertain your choices complicating the narrative. Depending on how you play, Rook can come from plenty of different backgrounds, make decisions that will affect thousands of people, but they can never really be an evil bastard. If they did, it would fundamentally undermine one of the game’s most pivotal moments. In the eleventh hour, <em>Dragon Age </em>mainstay Varric Tethras is revealed to have died in the opening hour, and essentially leaves all his hopes and dreams on the shoulders of Rook. After our hero is banished to the Fade and forced to confront their regrets in a mission gone south, Varric’s spirit sends Rook on their way to save the day one last time. He does so with a hearty chuckle, saying he doesn’t need to wish you good luck because “you already have everything you need.” He is, of course, referring to the friends you have calling to you from beyond the Fade. </p><figure id="" data-id="2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-recommend-id="image://2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-recommend-id="image://2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Varric, the narrator of <em>Dragon Age,</em> uses his final word to declare a belief that things will be okay. This isn’t because Rook is the chosen one, destined to save the world, but because they have found people who are unified by one thing: a need to fight for a better world. That declaration concluding what’s possibly <em>Dragon Age</em>’s final<em> </em>game is what makes it compelling. Reaching the end of a universe’s arc and being wholly uninterested in leaving it desecrated by hubris or prejudice is a bold claim on BioWare’s part. It takes some authorship away from the player, but in return, it leaves the world of Thedas in a better place than we found it.</p><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is an idealistic game, but it’s one that BioWare has earned the right to make. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s legacy has been one of constantly shifting identity, at least two counts of development hell, and a desire to give players a sandbox to roleplay in. Perhaps, as <em>Dragon Age </em>likely comes to a close, it’s better to leave the series with a game as optimistic as the people who made it. I can’t think of a more appropriate finale than one that represents the world its creators hope to see, even as the world we live in now gives us every reason to fall into despair.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA.">my review of <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>,<em> </em>I signed off expressing hope for BioWare’s future that feels a bit naive in retrospect. Would a divisive but undeniably polished RPG that felt true to the studio’s history be enough when, after 10 years of development, c-suite suits were probably looking for a decisive cultural moment? That optimism was just about a video game. Having lived through the past 32 years, looking back, most of the optimism I’ve ever held feels naive. I think I’m losing hope that the world will get any better. But even if we haven’t reached <em>The Veilguard</em>’s idealized vision, I’ll take some comfort in knowing someone previously at BioWare still believes it’s possible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

and Xbox Series X|S. This means that the next mainline entry is making a proper leap over to current-gen systems, leaving last-gen consoles behind.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_story">Resident Evil: Requiem story</h2><p>Requiem stars a new character in the form of FBI technical analyst Grace Ashcroft--the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft--who is tasked with exploring a series of recent murders that were committed at the Wrenwood Hotel. Ashcroft has a personal connection to this location as this is the site where her mother was murdered, and Capcom says that players can expect "a new era of survival-horror," amplified by technological advancements in the RE Engine that powers the game.</p><p>The interesting thing about Resident Evil Outbreak was that the playable characters had been infected with one of Umbrella Corporation's viruses, making the experience that much more challenging in this 2003 multiplayer co-op game. Alyssa appears to have survived the events of the game--some of her journalistic work was referenced in later Resident Evil games--and it'll be interesting to see if Requiem links back to Outbreak.</p><p>For the first time in a <em>long </em>time, Resident Evil is also returning to Raccoon City. The iconic city was leveled with an experimental thermobaric missile strike toward the end of Resident Evil 2, and since then, it has been a desolate crater that has remained unexplored in other Resident Evil sequels. The reveal trailer for the game teased a few familiar locations, like the police department that is barely standing amidst the charred ruins of the devastated city.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_gameplay">Resident Evil: Requiem gameplay</h2><p>Your average Resident Evil protagonist knows how to handle a firearm, but in comparison, Grace isn't as skilled. While she's still capable of defending herself, Capcom's description for the game suggests that fleeing from danger is the best path forward. The game combines "deeply terrifying aspects of psychological horror with pulse-pounding action that franchise fans know and love," Capcom says.</p><p>One other interesting tidbit is that you can choose to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-will-terrify-from-multiple-camera-angles/1100-6532355/">play Requiem from multiple angles</a>.

If the controller supports vibration and/or motion controls, it typically supports those features when synced to the adapter. It's also compatible with all 8BitDo Bluetooth controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Arcade-Stick-Switch-Windows-nintendo/dp/B08GJC5WSS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch/PC Arcade Stick</a>, which has yet to receive an official Switch 2 update.</p><p>You can use your PS5's controller settings or the Xbox/PC accessories app to remap inputs, but 8BitDo's Ultimate Software offers support for Microsoft's first-party controllers, DualSense, DualShock 4, and Switch Pro Controllers. With the free Windows app, you can remap your controls and adjust settings such as trigger, stick, and vibration sensitivity.</p><p>8BitDo also updated its original USB adapter to add Switch 2 compatibility. That said, we wouldn't recommend buying that one since it doesn't support Xbox Wireless Controllers and costs the same price.</p></div>                      </div><h2>How to set up 8BitDo Adapter 2 on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p>Once you get your adapter, you'll need to connect it your Windows PC or Mac and download <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo's firmware updater tool</a> or <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate/usb-adapter-2.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Software</a>. The latest update adds Nintendo Switch 2 support. After completing the update, which only takes a few seconds, you can connect it to one of the free USB-A ports on the Switch 2 dock.</p><p>Before you can sync a controller to the adapter, you need to enable support for 2.4GHz Wireless and wired controllers. In System Settings on your console, find Controllers &amp; Accessories, and make sure the box for Pro Controller Wired Communication is checked.</p><p>To establish a wireless connection, press the pairing button on the top of the adapter and enter pairing mode on your controller.</p><p>The 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 is a handy little device for platforms beyond Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Focus Entertainment proudly <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1933192827170627788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has surpassed the enviable milestone of seven million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Saber Interactive's third-person shooter game launched on September 9, 2024, and immediately became a hit. The following day, Focus Home <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that two million copies had already been sold. Those <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became</a> five million units near the end of November.</p>
<p>A sequel was already inevitable at that point, though we weren't expecting an announcement anytime soon. Instead, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development as early as this March, promising even larger battles.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean support for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is ending anytime soon. In fact, at the recent 2025 Skulls event, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-games-roundup-from-2025-skulls-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-updates-for-darktide-and-space-marine-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Siege Mode is being added to the game in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's a detailed overview of Siege Mode provided by Saber Interactive:</p>
<p><em>The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</em></p>
<p><em>Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications. Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</em></p>
<p><em>Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</li>
<li><em>Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</em></li>
<li><em>Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower.</em></li>
<li><em>Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</em></li>
</ul>

There are two reasons you shouldn't watch the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep's</a> just announced DLC Siren's Rest. The first is that, well, it'll probably spoil at least some of the events of the base game given that the expansion is set more than a decade on. The other is for the subset of you that have just the worst case of submechanophobia, because the trailer is absolutely full of man-made objects under water. You've been warned, don't come crying to me if you don't heed me, I'll just say I told you so.

<p>
So! Where the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game takes place on an oil rig in 1975, Siren's Rest stays in the same location but moves forward an entire 11 years. With a new cast, you'll be sent to the North Sea to see what's become of the Beira D, using tools like a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera to try and figure out what happened to the crew that manned it. "But beware," a press release teases, "there are things lurking in the depths that even the sea cannot claim." Scary!

Previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> narrative designer Sagar Beroshi has penned Siren's Rest, with Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who) coming aboard as its protagonist Mhairi. She's joined by Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton) and David Menkin (Final Fantasy 16, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>) in as of yet unnamed roles.
</p>
<p>
It's also out really soon! In less than a week in fact, as it's due to be released June 18th, next Wednesday. Doesn't sound too bad for something that essentially sounds like a mini sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-first-hands-on-preview-twin-stick-hades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Had I not known in advance that I was going to be playing Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree at Play Days last weekend, I might have overlooked its trailer during Summer Game Fest. The announcement itself was less than two minutes long, and what we saw mostly looked like Hades, but with character selection. However, after playing 15 minutes of the game at Play Days, I'm far more interested than I initially expected to be in Towa's take on the roguelite genre...though I'm going to need waaay more than 15 minutes to get good at it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree stars Towa, the guardian of Shinju Village and a child of the gods. When a dark god begins consuming the land around Shinju with an evil miasma, Towa rallies eight villagers to fight back. These "Prayer Children" head out into the field, two at a time, to fight against the minions of darkness, with one taking on the role of "Tsurugi", or sword, and the other taking on the supportive staff role, or "Kagura."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of each run, you pick which of the eight characters you want in each role, with all characters having different abilities depending on which role they took on. In my preview, I selected the solumn Rekka as my sword, who attacks with short, quick slashes and a lingering spin attack. My staff was Nishiki, a Koi-inspired fish person who can summon lightning orbs to surround the player and shoot a wave of water in any direction.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At the start of each run, you pick which of the eight characters you want in each role.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Immediately, I struggled a bit to adapt to the twin-stick controls. Nishiki automatically followed Rekka, who I controlled with the left stick, but it was clear that for optimal play I needed to break Nishiki free of Rekka and run him around with the right stick simultaneously as I fought enemies. Easier said than done. I think this is a really interesting twist on what I'm used to for top-down games, almost reminiscent of the original The World Ends With You having you control two characters on two different screens. But I do think I needed more than 15 minutes in a demo to get used to it. Apparently, you can also play Towa in co-op, with one person controlling each character, and that's an appealing prospect, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second unique element that I really, really wanted more time to master was Quick Draw. In Towa, your sword wielder carries not one, but two swords, but only has one equipped at a time. Each sword has a different ability, with Rekka having her short slashes attached to one and her chargeable spin attack on the other. As you use one sword, it begins to dull until it's unusable, and you have to use a Quick Draw ability to swap to the other one so the first can recharge. Successful combat in Towa revolves around smoothly swapping between the two swords so you're never caught in a situation where you need one attack ready, but have a dull blade and are stuck with an inefficient ability. It's a cool system in principle, certainly a unique one, and I'm curious as to how it will play out at higher skill levels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Everything else I saw in Towa will be familiar to your average Hades-lover.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else I saw in Towa will be familiar to your average Hades-lover. You'll clear all the monsters in a room, and get a choice of a "Grace". Graces enhance your power in all sorts of ways, from straight power increases to changing how different abilities work and interact with one another. Doors to the next room may denote enemies or shopkeepers or other room types, and you'll smash stuff as you go to collect currency for upgrades at shops and special ore that can be enhance your characters' abilities when you take it back to the village.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with Towa was cut short just as I walked into a boss battle, so unfortunately I can't speak to how that would have played out. But this preview absolutely succeeded in making me want to play <em>more</em>. I want to muck around with the different character configurations and see what other upgrades are available, and I want to practice my twin-stick game so my staff user doesn't die on me before I even hit the halfway point (oops). I don't know if Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree can live up to the lofty legacy of Hades necessarily, but I do think it has the potential to carve out a space in the roguelite genre all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/renown-has-medieval-survival-promise-but-has-a-lot-of-work-left-to-do<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">No one will claim that Renown, the Medieval European-flavored base-building survival game, is bringing brand new ideas to the genre. If you’ve played anything like it, from its primary inspiration, Rust, to more modern iterations like Runescape: Dragonwilds, you have a good idea of what you’re in for when you drop into a server to start your journey from humble homesteader to lord of the realm. My brief hands-on time with it was fun, but also raises and doesn’t clearly answer an important question: if you currently have a favorite survival game, is it worth making the switch right now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My crash course started with a tour of some aspirational structures that were all built with in-game resources. Some of them, like a huge castle complete with a small village lingering in its shadow, were things the team taking me on the tour, lead by Game Director Jesse Jacobsen,  didn’t expect to see players to ever be able to make without concerted team efforts. But the ones that were within reasonable player reach were cool in their own rights. Tall sturdy stone walls with mighty working gates to keep enemies out and winding halls and spiraling stairs is a step above what is often just square rooms with storage stuffed in them. The couple I walked through myself came with a significant investment of time and in-game gold, and was positioned as the form your typical endgame stronghold would want to look like before the regular server resets.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Renown Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's only right that we spent the first bit of our session tearing one of them up in a raid, right? After taking a quick spin on a catapult, a few of the devs entrenched themselves inside a nearby fort, while my group attempted to conquer it. We left the siege machine behind and opted for something more mobile: hammers and door-breaching petards to turn them into splinters. When inside, we ran through the halls and stairways looking for fights, eventually culminating into a sprawling skirmish up on the battlements. After putting down the foes, we took the castle’s banner, and claimed it for ourselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Renown is heavily skewed towards players who would rather raise a sword to fight versus a hammer to build.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These fun scenarios make up the bulk of Renown, which is heavily skewed towards players who would rather raise a sword to fight versus a hammer to build. This is reinforced by its mechanically nuanced melee system that takes cues from games like Chivalry, Mordhau, or Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Swinging your weapon at various angles creates different offensive maneuvers which can be useful for getting around shields, the safest and most reliable defense you’ll encounter. For the bolder player, a parry exists that, when timed right, can be followed up with a fast attack that helps poke holes in stubborn defenders. In one-on-one duels, all of this nuance shines and creates a tense back and forth that you won’t find in simpler melee systems. It’s not quite realism, but the lethality of every strike mixed with the motion captured HEMA animations really elevates swordplay in the moment. In multiplayer brawls, I relied very little on these tools, opting to just gang up on whoever my squad was bullying to overwhelm them with blows they couldn’t possibly deflect. Maybe it's pretty realistic after all. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting the combat right was the driving force behind Jesse and Executive Producer Charlie Ettershank’s need to make Renown a reality. “Ever since me and Charlie met, we would spend most nights after school discussing how cool it would be for Chivalry combat to be in a survival game.” Jesse told me. They played games like Realm of Kings and Rust and would love everything about it except the melee combat, and took it upon themselves to create the thing they wanted to see in the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You of course can’t become a badass knight decked out head-to-toe in plate armor without first knocking trees over with a stick in order to build the workbench that will produce all you need for your empire. The gathering process in survival games like this is never one that I would confidently call “engaging,” but Renown’s is especially boring in comparison to its peers. Some parts of the process are streamlined – you still need to build individual fixtures to craft specific things like a tailor’s bench to make leather armor and a stone furnace to smelt metals – but all the crafting can be done in your inventory menu so you don’t have to stop at every little building to make and receive stuff. But gathering materials felt like more of a chore than ever. Things are pretty expensive, so you'll need a good amount of wood and stone to get the basics. At least they’re easy to find. I spent 10 minutes walking around in search of animals to hunt for hide and fat, essential for moving through the tech tree, and couldn’t find any. I imagine all of this plays differently with a server full of other players who can potentially harass you during your gathering and construction campaigns, but in this leisurely environment, I found it tough to stay motivated to grind. The “survival” part of Renown is also exclusively a PVP thing, as there isn’t much to manage as far as keeping yourself alive if there are no enemy arrows to dodge. Without genre staples like hunger meters or day/night cycles I was free to exist completely at my pace. These mechanics are often nags but without them there’s uncomfortably little push back when playing alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are quite a few steps between crafting your first workstation and creating a sword, steps that can be bypassed if you're willing to venture out into the wilderness to find loot. I did not get to experience this part of Renown in any meaningful way, but I was told that prebuilt points of interest, like the aforementioned grand castle, double as hot spots full of gear and trinkets that could be an instant upgrade to a players kit or at least worth lots of in game gold. I can only speculate that in a PVP environment, this kind of skulking around presents the same dangers as other popular survival games, but I couldn’t speak on how this flows with Renown’s heavy focus on intimate close quarters combat. There were a lot of features that sound great but either I didn’t experience them directly, or they weren’t available yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This biggest feature coming that I think will be a pivotal one for Renown’s success long-term are server events. As it stands pre-early access, the 8000 or so playtesters in the alpha right now are tasked to find their own fun, with the construction and combat systems both being toys in an open sandbox of possibilities without any explicit direction from the game itself. Right now, a solid contingent of players collaborate to build strongholds and siege weapons and march on enemy camps without much prompting, but even the RDBK team admits that some guided play would bring some necessary balance. One event they’ve been prototyping would turn an NPC settlement into a claimable fortress when signaled, driving all of the disparate bands of warriors on the server to join one another in chaotic combat over it. Other ideas are based in similar form as this, with caches of loot spawning in specific locations on the map to be claimed by whoever can secure it first. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There were a lot of features that sound great but either I didn’t experience them directly, or they weren’t available yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But Jesse really emphasized how important, and frankly proud, he is of being a facilitator of the sandbox for individual communities to flourish in. His team has even reached out and recruited almost all of the official Rust server hosts to run Renown servers. “That’s mostly because we’ve provided them the tools… to make that an easy process.” Jesse assured, as well as providing financial compensation for the effort. The goal being that they can use their particular expertise to help modify and regulate game tools and create server climates that can cater to all sorts of players. Maybe I'm not the only one who thinks the grind speed is slow, as there could be a server that picks up the pace or starts players off with kits of goods to get off of the blocks faster. Servers wipe weekly to keep player progress from being insurmountable, but a server can exist where those wipes happen less often, if at all. The Renown team want as close to infinite player adaptability as possible, and they want to be as involved as a server host needs them to be to make it happen. “We think we have a good idea of what makes the most enjoyable gameplay aspect, but we're not going to kid ourselves and think that no one else could think of something better inside of this sandbox, ya know?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of the ruggedness of Renown’s alpha state is manageable, and is probably even great when you have a dedicated community to play it with. But there are a few pain points that are going to make it a tough sell for people not already bought in for the long haul. I had quite a bit of performance issues when playing – both with the devs and on my own. Framerates jolted and lag really did its best to undermine me when I needed the stability most. The current UI and menus are rough around the edges and inconsistent throughout, some tooltips are arrayed across selection wheels while others sit in lists that are difficult to navigate while in the thick of the action. All of these things are on the list to reform and fix as the development team expands, hopefully before its slated Q3 2025 Early Access launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Renown’s crunchy combat has a lot of potential in a genre not known for making close combat an elaborate affair. The basic and sometimes mundane gathering and building game that you have to trudge through to get to cool stuff is very raw and still has a ways to go to meet the quality standard of the games it hopes to compete with. While its dearth of content, stability issues, and ragged UI are strictly RDBK Studios’ responsibility, the community is poised to have a lot of control over the day-to-day experience. Time will tell if the former can come together quickly enough to nurture the latter.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/looks-like-classic-puzzler-boulder-dash-is-getting-a-40th-anniversary-re-release">We reported back last year</a> on the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/boulder_dash_40th_anniversary">Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary</a>, and now we know that the game will launch on <strong>July 24th</strong> for Switch, and it'll only set you back £19.99/$19.99. Heck, this time you can even have a gander at how it all looks in motion in the above gameplay vid. Result!</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/boulder_dash">Boulder Dash</a>, which was first released all the way back in 1984 (when this writer was already busting heads in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/bruce_lee_return_of_the_legend">Bruce Lee</a> game on his trusty C64), has seen a few re-releases before, including on its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/boulder_dash_30th_anniversary">30th anniversary</a>, but this time it seems there are a few more changes to the classic formula, including a level editor for sharing your own creations online.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>According to the game's official press release, this new effort features "Brand New Levels, New Design, New Challenges, New Worlds, Plus More!" That does sound exciting, to be fair.</p>
<p>With 180 levels to blast through in total, and with Rockford returning to his role as chief...eh...smasher of rocks (alongside what appears to be a few other selectable characters) this certainly looks the business, and although the art style is almost alarmingly crisp, it <em>does</em> harken back to the OG, and it looks as th</p>

<p>It seems as though the devs have been more than diligent too, with Boulder Dash world champions invited to play the game and Boulder Dashes 1, 2 and 3 all in the mix within this one revamp, as BBG explains;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We pursued two goals: Firstly, we wanted to bring the first three parts Boulder Dash I, II and III to life as faithfully as possible on current machines. Secondly, we wanted to spice up the classic gameplay with contemporary visuals and suitable new ideas such as growing walls, slime, an enemy generator, eggs and other things.<br>
<em>On top we have integrated a level editor which allows the users to create, play and share all these levels to Boulder Dash players worldwide</em>..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the OG Boulder Dash games, as is the case here, your task is to open the exit on each screen, which sounds simple but is in fact an engrossing mix of puzzling, dodging and timing your moves to deal with foes. It was a revelation back in the day and, with the right treatment, the gameplay here should stand the test of time well.</p>

<p>Otherwise, leave you with a "fact's attack" from the press release and some screens to satiate long-time Boulder Dash fans in the meantime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 6 new, never-before-seen worlds<br>
- 3 new worlds created by hardcore the fans<br>
- 180 completely new, balanced, and refined levels<br>
- Variety of new and unique items, including growing walls, slime, enemy generator, eggs, plus more<br>
- Construction kit to create, share, or download other players’ levels<br>
- Distinctive visual style that aims to blend original color schemes with contemporary themes<br>
- Option to select and play for one of the three main heroes, each crafted in line with the game’s original vision<br>
- Music and sounds composed by Germany’s most famous video game musician Chris Huelsbeck (Giana Sisters, Turrican, Star Wars Rogue Squadron, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate and many more).</p>

			<p>The launch for Build A Rocket Boy's debut game, MindsEye, hasn't exactly gone the way the studio would have hoped. The simple fact that PlayStation, a company that very rarely gives players refunds for purchases on the PS Store, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">is giving players refunds for their purchases of MindsEye</a>&nbsp;says a lot about how things are going on its own.</p>
<p>Shortly after players started to publicly announce they had gotten refunds from PlayStation, and as more videos of bugs and long statements from players appear on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/">Reddit,</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy released a <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933167455238594939">statement to the game's official X account</a>, saying that the team is "<em>heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also pinned the issues the game is having on a memory leak, claiming that "<em>roughly 1 in 10 of our players</em>" were impacted by this issue, and that a hotfix has been made to fix the problem. That fix, along with a few more that Build A Rocket Boy detailed in its statement, will be pushed to players starting tomorrow, with more fixes to come throughout the weekend, continuing on through next week, and basically through the rest of the month.</p>
<p>"<em>We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates</em>," the studio continued in its statement. "<em>We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback. Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support - it truly means the world to us. We're grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I feel like a broken record, but I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>. Now, I think Microsoft just teased its next-gen Xbox plans while announcing its partnership with Asus to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two Xbox Ally handhelds</a> to the market later this year.</p><p>The Xbox Ally handhelds run Windows, but the Xbox team has worked with Windows engineers to boot these PC handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">into a full-screen Xbox UI</a>. The Windows desktop doesn’t even fully load, and you use the Xbox app UI as a launcher to get to all your games (even Steam titles) and apps like Discord.</p><p>While the combination of Windows and Xbox here is intriguing, it’s the way that Microsoft is positioning these devices that really caught my attention. “This is an Xbox,” said Microsoft during the reveal, clearly expanding its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing push</a> beyond a single console to every screen and device.</p><p>It all felt like a true Xbox handheld reveal. There was even an 11-minute-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">behind-the-scenes video</a> on the Xbox Ally handhelds, filmed in a similar style to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dRgWpGePs">“Project Scorpio” Xbox One X reveal</a> from nearly nine years ago. “This is a breakthrough moment for Xbox,” <strong>Carl Ledbetter</strong>, a 30-year Microsoft design veteran, says in the video. Ledbetter helped design the original IntelliMouse, the Xbox 360 Slim, the Xbox One X, and plenty of other Microsoft devices. When Ledbetter is involved, you know it’s more than just a simple partner project with Asus.</p><p>“For the first time, a player is going to be able to hold the power of the Xbox experience in their hand, and take it with them anywhere they want to go,” says Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong>, in the same video. Microsoft thinks of the Xbox Ally handhelds as Xbox consoles with the freedom of Windows, and I think the next-gen Xbox is going to look very similar as a result.</p><p>Microsoft’s own Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization">was reportedly</a> “sidelined” recently, and I’ve heard from insiders that it’s essentially canceled as the company focuses on Xbox’s new software platform. I still think we’ll see next-gen Xbox hardware from Microsoft, but I also strongly believe we’ll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles.</p><p>That’s because the next-gen Xbox platform is being built in the open, with devices like the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. These handhelds seem like a market test for where Microsoft goes next with the combination of Windows and Xbox, and the company’s goal to turn any screen into an Xbox.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> made it clear in an <a href="https://youtu.be/mw26FdfkUDM">Xbox podcast</a> earlier this week that the Windows and Xbox teams are working more closely than ever. He also revealed this is to make the PC gaming experience more console-like:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>This is the tightest collaboration I’ve seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company. For 25 years, almost, we’ve been working on a console experience where you turn it on and it works and your games are there, and how do we bring that to the Windows ecosystem so you get the freedom of Windows to use the storefronts and the apps you want to use, but it feels like a device that’s purpose-built.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>There are plenty of technical challenges on the Windows side to fix, but these new Xbox Ally handheld devices also demonstrate a challenge for Microsoft: it’s about to sell an “Xbox handheld” that won’t run most Xbox console games natively. I’ve seen plenty of hands-on YouTube videos claiming this is a true “Xbox handheld,” but very few make it clear that it’s actually only natively running PC games.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox Play Anywhere effort lets you buy an Xbox game and get the PC version, but only a small amount of Xbox games and publishers are currently part of this. This isn’t an issue for Microsoft’s own first-party Xbox games, as they’ve been publishing to PC for years now, but upcoming games like <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> won’t run on these Xbox handhelds. You’ll have to stream <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> instead, until the PC version, which hasn’t been announced yet, is released.</p><p>I think most consumers won’t even realize this is the case as Microsoft is already heavily marketing these handhelds as Xboxes. Xbox fans were going wild <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLEflHcy8bU">during a watch party</a>, but as soon as the ROG logo appeared the room got a lot more subdued. This highlights Microsoft’s brand challenges here and why Xbox fans are cautious when it comes to the complexity of a PC and the future of their game library. Either way, the real benefit of Microsoft’s approach is access to Steam PC games and even PlayStation PC titles on “Xbox handhelds,” so Microsoft should lean into that selling point initially.</p><p>Over the long term, I think Microsoft will eventually solve this challenge through emulation. Bond created a new team focused on game preservation and forward compatibility in early 2024, but there are technical and licensing hurdles to overcome before original Xbox, Xbox 360, and modern Xbox games can run emulated on a PC.</p><p>Until Microsoft is ready with emulation, it’s filling the gaps with Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming instead. Microsoft’s Xbox app on PC will simply show your recently played games, and then you can just play them — whether it’s natively or streaming through the cloud. Microsoft has already done all the important work for cloud saves, so this makes the experience a lot more seamless.</p><p>All of this work is moving in a direction that Microsoft keeps talking about: choice. Instead of buying one Xbox console from Microsoft, what if you could buy Xbox consoles from lots of PC makers without ever having to see the complexity of Windows?</p><p>Microsoft is going to change the next generation of game consoles if it can pull this off. The company is already opening up its Xbox PC app to list Steam games, so having the ability to run <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">Steam games on next-gen Xbox</a> consoles doesn’t feel all that far-fetched anymore. </p><p>I don’t think Microsoft is doing a bunch of Windows and Xbox work just to have this software running on handhelds. I think this work will give Microsoft the ability to control the console-like experience and UI on a variety of hardware, in a way where it can upsell Game Pass, its own Xbox PC games, and more. Microsoft is already in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221036/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-valve-steamos">handheld gaming PC race</a> against Valve and SteamOS, but that’s a smaller battle in the war to define the next generation of video game consoles. </p><p>As I’ve written plenty of times before, the key to this next-gen Xbox platform will be Microsoft’s execution. It has everything it needs to make this approach a success, but Microsoft’s focus on gaming on Windows has been disastrous in the past. With the Windows and Xbox teams now working together more closely than ever before, it’s make or break time for a new Xbox platform that looks like it’s going to extend far beyond the confines of a handheld PC.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>You can now try Microsoft’s new Start menu for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft is now allowing Windows 11 testers to try out a new, larger Start menu that includes a scrollable interface, new views, and more customization. The best thing about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/683818/microsoft-windows-11-new-start-menu-testing-dev-channel">this refreshed Start menu</a> is that you can now disable the recommended section and see a lot more of your own apps. Microsoft has also made the Start menu larger based on the screen size of your device or monitor. I’d still like to see a bigger overhaul to the Start menu, but having two new category and grid views certainly helps.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is moving its Build conference out of Seattle for 2026. </strong>Microsoft isn’t planning to host its Build developer conference in its home city of Seattle next year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684313/microsoft-build-conference-2026-location">The conference is being relocated</a>, and Microsoft isn’t saying where it will host Build next, after holding it in Seattle since 2017. One report suggests that the move out of Seattle could have been related to attendee experiences in downtown Seattle. An email is making the rounds locally in Seattle that claims Build attendees had “cited the general uncleanliness of the streets, visible drug use, and the presence of unhoused individuals.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge is getting an AI-powered browser history that works with typos. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new feature for its Edge browser that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684195/microsoft-edge-ai-browser-history-search-feature">adds an AI-powered search to browsing history</a>. This new “enhanced search” feature lets you find websites in your browser history even if you use a phrase, synonym, or even a typo that’s similar to the site you actually want to find. This feature is opt-in and uses an on-device model to train on browsing history data “which never leaves your device and is never sent to Microsoft.” This seems like less of a privacy risk than Microsoft’s Recall feature, and you don’t have to worry about snapshots of your screen being stored in a local database, either.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ two new Xbox Ally handhelds are coming later this year</strong>. We don’t have pricing for either device yet, but we do have specs for the new Xbox Ally handhelds. The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 900p to 1080p gaming on the go.

Some games were making Windows BSOD, but Microsoft notes that its June update wasn’t available for PCs with Easy Anti-Cheat installed, so only a small number of people will have installed the update and then installed an incompatible game afterward. Either way, it’s all fixed now with an additional update.</span></li><li><span><strong>Did Microsoft just tease a Halo CE remaster? </strong>Regular Notepad readers will know I teased a <em>Halo CE</em> remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">last year</a>, and Xbox chief Phil Spencer appears to have confirmed that it’s on the way. At the end of the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682493/did-microsoft-just-tease-a-halo-ce-remaster">Spencer casually revealed</a> that “the next <em>Forza</em>” is coming next year, along with “the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” <em>Halo CE</em> was the launch title for the original Xbox, which turns 25 years old in 2026.</span></li><li><span><strong>Gears of War: E-Day is coming in 2026</strong>. Microsoft also confirmed this week that <em>E-Day</em> won’t be launching in 2025 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682283/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-2026">will debut in 2026 instead</a>. The latest entry in the sci-fi shooter series will be released in the year that marks the 20th anniversary of the original <em>Gears of War</em> game debuting on the Xbox 360. It also means that Xbox’s 25-year milestone will include new <em>Halo</em>, <em>Forza</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Gears </em>games.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge’s picture-in-picture mode is getting better controls. </strong>The picture-in-picture window in Edge is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681499/microsoft-edges-picture-in-picture-mode-is-getting-better-controls">getting the ability</a> to easily pause, play, and skip forward or backward. The UI looks a lot like the Windows Media Player, and it’s part of a new media control center for the Edge browser.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is just leaving some Liquid Glass here. </strong>Who did the glass-like design first? Was it Apple with its Aqua transparency effects in 2000 or Microsoft with its Aero Glass theme in Windows Vista in 2007?

In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s <strong>Emily Chang</strong>, Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> has admitted that the company’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-05/microsoft-ceo-says-openai-alliance-changing-but-remains-strong">OpenAI relationship is changing</a>. “Any company that has gone from being a research lab to one of the most successful product companies of this age — obviously things have to change for them and for us and in the context of the partnership,” Nadella says. Microsoft is increasingly focused on diversifying its AI model usage, instead of relying solely on OpenAI’s latest advancements.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new Copilot Vision can “see” your apps on Windows. </strong>Microsoft is launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685963/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-launch">Copilot Vision for Windows today</a>, an extension of its AI assistant that lets you share your screen or apps so that Copilot can do things like coach you through using Adobe Photoshop features or analyze the photos and webpages you’re looking at. I first tried this during the 50th anniversary event in April, and I was surprised to see it could guide me through playing Minecraft or using some Windows apps. It’s launching for Windows users in the US today.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.

<section><p>The Lumines series is getting a major glow-up--literally and metaphorically.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After playing 20 minutes of Lumines Arise, the team from Enhance presented me with a difficult decision. "We have another 20 or so minutes left. Do you want to spend the rest of your time asking us some questions, or would you like to play a bit more?" And as much as I wanted to jump straight into interviews and pick the minds of the folks who brought us Humanity, Tetris Effect, and Rez Infinite, I found myself betrayed by my own childlike glee.</p><p dir="ltr">"Would you mind if I do just a couple more levels?" I asked.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in that moment--when the part of me that simply loves games overtook the part of me that tries her hardest to maintain a writer's sensibilities--that I realized I <em>really</em> enjoyed my time with Lumines Arise. And though of course I took time to chat with game and art director Takashi Ishihara and creative producer Mark MacDonald and enjoyed every minute of it, I left the preview event wishing that somehow the next entry in the Lumines series was back at my hotel, loaded up on my Steam Deck, and waiting for me to get back to playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't to say I didn't get enough time to get a sense of how Lumines Arise is shaping up. During the preview event, I played through a pre-made playlist of four songs followed by <em>another</em> playlist with two additional songs after I proved overly voracious. With each track lasting around four minutes, this made for around 30 minutes of Lumines Arise goodness. From what I gathered, it seems as though the mode I played essentially allows players to construct their own setlists by selecting songs from the game's main story, referred to as Journey mode. As such, I encountered the songs out of order and without the context that I assume would be provided in story mode. And yet, that didn't stop them from being visually delightful, memorable, and, most importantly, a lot of fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721"></a><figcaption>A golden-hued level that sees players arrange dark blue orbs and yellow squares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with Lumines, the overall gameplay feels very similar to Tetris: Blocks fall down, you rotate and place them to help clear the board, and "topping out" spells game over. However, whereas Tetris sees you place tetrominos of various shapes down to help form lines that then clear your board, Lumines focuses entirely on squares. Each construct you are given is 2x2 consisting of up to two different types of blocks; as you place them down, your goal is to form squares (2x2 or greater) consisting of the same block type.</p><p dir="ltr">Once a square is formed, you have until the vertical "Time Line" sweeps across the board to add to it, making the seconds between a square's construction and that sweep a rush to extend your block to a 3x3, 4x4, and so on. Though it doesn't directly correlate to the track's RPM, the Time Line helps emphasize the musicality of the game and builds up your internal rhythm. Arise also gets a new twist with its Burst meter, which slowly fills up over time and can then be used to lock a square to your grid for a few passes of the Time Line, allowing you to add to it for longer and subsequently clear more of the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this is all relatively simple to grasp, it's certainly harder in execution. And interestingly, the more I <em>thought </em>about what I was doing in Lumines Arise, the trickier things seemed to become. Fortunately, everything about Arise--from its music and visuals to its gameplay--encourages you to enter the same trance-like flow state it inhabits. Everything is fluid, stylish, and hypnotizing. And yet, there is an undeniable tension that comes hand-in-hand with these sorts of puzzle games--the ones that can grow overwhelming, constricting, and unwieldy with just a few poorly placed tiles. Ultimately, though, all this makes for wonderful juxtaposition that is not just a core part of Lumines Arise mechanically, but narratively as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712"></a><figcaption>A darker level that is largely silent and features empty boxes and clunky, metal box fans.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I didn't play Arise's Journey mode, one of the handful of levels I did play was notably darker in tone than the others, offering a look at places the game's narrative might go. In place of pulsing lights and electronic pop was oppressive silence and mechanical groans; rather than placing down flashing circles and boxes, I was given harsh, metal box fans and hollow white boxes to try to form into squares. Within a minute, I felt incredibly tense, and told the team as much with a nervous laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">According to creative producer Mark MacDonald, this was entirely the point, as Arise's story focuses on "life's highs and lows, and how we balance the good with the bad." Naturally, actually tackling this theme and conveying these messages is a bit difficult due to the game's lack of a written narrative. Though having songs with lyrics in the game can act as a sort of "cheat," MacDonald laughed, as it gives players a more clear sense of how they are meant to feel, lyrics can often be a bit abstract or metaphorical. Atmosphere, then, is largely how the team makes this happen, and just as Lumines influenced how Enhance constructed Tetris Effect's environments and storytelling, the team said they looked to Tetris Effect to shape Arise.</p><p dir="ltr">"A challenge of our games is that we are telling stories in abstract ways and in ways only we have really done," MacDonald said. "Lumines informed Tetris Effect, and now we're seeing things circle as Tetris Effect shapes Lumines Arise."</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after this interaction, the eerie, monochromatic level started to unweave itself and came to an end. I was then greeted by two dancing chameleons, having the time of their lives, while a fast-paced song thumped away in the background. These levels are indeed an abstract and interesting take on life's "highs and lows," but they absolutely rule, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711"></a><figcaption>A funky level that features two chameleons and circles and squares to arrange.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As I bobbed my head along to the music and got back into the swing of things, game and art director Takashi Ishihara was delighted that the atmosphere he and the team had constructed was doing precisely what was intended.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some people cried when they finished Tetris Effect, and we were blown away by that response," Ishihara said. "I think people who have a deep connection to art and music--who are connected to their emotions and sensitive to atmosphere--will really respond to [Lumines Arise]."</p><p>That said, I suspect that even those coming to Lumines Arise purely for a delightful new puzzle game will still be plenty impressed. It's fun, engaging, <em>slightly</em> tense, visually spectacular, and has the same delightful fluidity that Enhance is known for delivering. All in all, I can't wait to spend more time with it once it hits PS5 and PC later this year.</p>

                <p>It's been almost a decade since the original Postal was given a modern remake in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-redux-pc-release-date-announced-ps4-edition/1100-6439661/" data-ref-id="1100-6439661">Postal Redux</a>. Now, it's time for 2003's Postal 2 to get the same treatment with Postal 2 Redux, "a ground‐up overhaul" of the original game.</p><p>Postal 2 Redux is in development with Flat2VR Studios, Team Beef, and Running With Scissors, with a Kickstarter campaign slated to begin later this summer. According to the announcement, the revitalized game grew out of an initial attempt to bring Postal 2 to VR. Now, the original assets will be recreated in Unity with "enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‐up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNUeNiAplI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzNUeNiAplI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the announcement teaser doesn't have much to show off, some of the features planned for Portal 2 Redux include the ability to pet Champ the dog, as well as the addition of dynamic lighting, more refined crowds, fully breakable interiors, and an open world that can be explored without any loading screens.</p><p>According to the developers, the plan is to bring Postal 2 Redux to PC, macOS, Linux rigs, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and possibly Switch 1 or 2. However, the team notes that the final platform lineup has yet to be finalized and it may depend on stretch goals achieved through Kickstarter as well as approval from the console-makers in question.</p><p>The Kickstarter pre-launch page for Postal 2 Redux is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently online</a>, but the campaign doesn't have an official start date yet. There's no word about whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-iii-review/1900-6348436/" data-ref-id="1900-6348436">Postal 3</a> may get remake as well. That game was so poorly received among Postal fans in 2011 that Running With Scissors later retconned <a href="https://postal.fandom.com/wiki/Postal_III" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Postal 3 as a non-canonical game</a>. The most recent title in the franchise was Postal 4: No Regerts, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-4-no-regerts-review-nothing-but-regrets/1900-6417864/" data-ref-id="1900-6417864">debuted to bad reviews</a> in 2022.</p>
