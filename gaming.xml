            <p>Dying Light 2 developer Techland has requested that the majority of staff – including employees who work abroad – come into the office full-time or commit to a "hybrid" model.</p>
<p>The studio says it needs people to come into the office "regularly to foster stronger connections".</p>
<p>According to Polish site <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/techland-konczy-z-praca-zdalna-pracownicy-zmiana-wprowadzona-nagle-i-bez-konsultacji">CD-Action</a>, "regularly" equates to eight working days every two months. The outlet also alleges that line managers were given less than 24 hours notice to cascade the news to their direct reports.</p>

<p>Other CD-Action sources claim the studio's current offices are not large enough to accommodate much more than ten percent of its 500 headcount. It's thought around half of those developers had, up until this point, work remotely.</p>
<p>"While remote work remains an option, we're transitioning most roles to either an on-site or hybrid model," Techland told our sister site, <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>"Employees who live near our offices will be asked to work from the office three days a week. For those working remotely from abroad, we're asking them to come to the office regularly to foster stronger connections.</p>
<p>"We understand this is a big change and all employees can still request home office days on demand as needed. We've just started this process and it's our goal to make the transition as smooth as possible and to support everyone individually."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-to-become-majority-shareholder-in-dying-light-studio-techland">Dying Light developer Techland announced a partnership with Tencent</a>, which has become a majority shareholder.</p>
<p>Techland's CEO Paweł Marchewka said this partnership would allow the team to "move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for [its] games", calling Tencent an "ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things".</p>
<p>Techland retains full ownership of its IPs and maintains its "creative freedom".</p>

			<p>Star Wars Outlaws, which has been described as the first true Star Wars open world game ever made, is just a month and a half away from its August 30 release date. The countdown to launch has started for fans, and the developers at Ubisoft Massive have been featured in a few new interviews ahead of the event.</p>
<p>Game Director Julian Gerighty spoke at length <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/star-wars-outlaws-began-life-in-a-cafe-at-e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with GamesIndustry</a>, addressing common concerns such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-crew-2-ubisofitiest-game/">fatigue for traditional Ubisoft open world games</a> like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed. According to Gerighty, Massive's DNA has always been different to begin with.</p>
<p><em>We are hyper conscious of the Ubisoft house style. Massive has always been different. The Division and The Division 2 were different. Originally, Massive was an independent studio, then an Activision studio, so it has always thought very differently. The DNA of Massive is quite unique from Ubisoft. But there are so many great lessons to be learned by the Ubisoft way of making games.</em></p>
<p><em>And Star Wars itself suggested some different ways of doing things. I will give you one example. Instead of having a skill tree and an upgrade tree like a traditional game, here you seek out experts to create this padawan/master relationship in the world, which will lead you on adventures in order to upgrade your character. Everything is ingrained in people and the world.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, there won't be any towers to climb in order to reveal the 'fog of war' on the various planets. Protagonist Kay Vess will instead need to eavesdrop or collect information straight from specific non-player characters (NPCs) to discover certain missions and activities.</p>
<p>The planets (and space, too) will also be lively at all times, with dynamic events such as the Empire arresting some civilians, criminal syndicates skirmishing with one another, and other such scenarios. It will be up to the player whether to engage or not. Recently, Ubisoft Massive also <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-developers-calibrated-its-size-to-ensure-it-would-be-always-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Star Wars Outlaws was carefully designed to ensure it would always feel fun, choosing quality over quantity. Even so, side content should be as long as the main quest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-qa-game-length-can-double-with-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the developers</a>. Completionists should be looking at around sixty hours worth of content in total.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is out on August 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. GeForce NOW users will be able to enjoy the PC version via cloud, including NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and ray tracing if they are subscribed to the Ultimate tier; the game will also be playable right away for Ubisoft+ subscribers.</p>

<p>Ever since the ever-growing popularity of titles such as Dark and Darker took the extraction genre by storm, we’ve witnessed firsthand as a subgenre blooms and flourishes. Now, the first-person medieval extraction game is becoming ever more popular, with titles such as Dungeonborne launching soon. But how much will Dungeonborne cost?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-price-of-dungeonborne">What is the Price of Dungeonborne?</h2>



<p>As of right now, there is no official word on how much Dungeonborne will cost. We do not have a price tag for the game. There are rumors that the studio will include a free-to-play, limited experience for new players to test out, similar to Dark and Darker.</p>



<p>Honestly, that’s likely a smart choice solely because of Dark and Darker. When the latter launched on Steam, it did so as a free-to-play “demo” of the main game, with limited mechanics and progression, to let new players test the experience before paying full price.</p>



<p>Dungeonborne may wish to do the same to entice the same crowd, as they’re direct competitors. That said, even if they don’t offer a free trial version, I suspect the game will be priced around the $30 mark, give or take. Of course, this is only a guest currently. We’ll know more shortly, as Dungeonborne launches on July 18!</p>







<h2 id="h-who-is-making-dungeonborne">Who is Making Dungeonborne?</h2>



<p>Dungeonborne is the first game of developer Mithril Interactive, a Singaporean video game studio. It’s their first commercial title to launch worldwide, or anywhere, for that matter, and is shaping up to be quite the success.</p>



<p>I played in one of the game’s testing phases, and despite losing out on a ton of loot due to werewolves and ghosts around every corner, I found it immensely fun. In fact, I’d go so far as to say the combat feels better than in Dark and Darker, which is a huge boon for the newcomer!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve is a famously secretive company with an enormous influence on the gaming industry, particularly because it runs the massive PC gaming storefront Steam. But despite that influence, Valve isn’t a large organization on par with EA or Riot Games’ thousands of employees: according to leaked data we’ve seen, as of 2021, Valve employed just 336 staffers.</p><p>The data was included as part of an otherwise heavily redacted document from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413196/valve-steam-lawsuit-wolfire-games-humble-bundle-app-store-cut-epic-apple">Wolfire’s antitrust lawsuit against Valve</a>. As spotted <a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1811727326138310962">by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik</a>, some data in the document was viewable despite the black redaction boxes, including Valve’s headcount and gross pay across various parts of the company over 18 years, and even some data about its gross margins that we weren’t able to uncover fully.</p><p>The employee data starts with 2003, which is a few years after Valve’s 1996 founding and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870270/steam-20-birthday-2003-2023">the same year Valve launched Steam</a>, and goes all the way up until 2021. The data breaks Valve employees into four different groups: “Admin,” “Games,” “Steam,” and, starting in 2011, “Hardware.”</p><p>If you want to sift through the numbers yourself, I’ve included a full table of the data, sorted by year and category, at the end of this story. In the document, the headings for the third and fourth columns are fully redacted, but the table is titled “Employee Headcount and Gross Pay Data, 2003-2021” so I’m presuming the data in those columns represent gross pay and number of employees, respectively.</p><p>One data point I found interesting: Valve peaked with its “Games” payroll spending in 2017 at $221 million (the company didn’t release any new games that year, but that spending could have gone toward supporting games like <em>Dota 2</em> and developing new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314103/valve-ending-development-artifact-tcg-dota-2"><em>Artifact</em></a>); by 2021, that was down to $192 million. Another: as of 2021, Valve employed just 79 people for Steam, which is one of the most influential gaming storefronts on the planet.</p><p>“Hardware,” to my surprise, has been a relatively small part of the company, with just 41 employees paid a gross of more than $17 million in 2021. But I’m guessing Valve now employs more hardware-focused staffers following the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions">runaway success of the Steam Deck</a>. In November 2023, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais told <em>The Verge</em> that he thinks “we’re firmly in the camp of being a full fledged hardware company by now.”</p><div><p>Wolfire alleged Valve “...devotes a miniscule percentage of its revenue to maintaining and improving the Steam Store.”</p></div><p>The small number of staff across the board seemingly explains why Valve’s product list is so limited despite its immense&nbsp;business as basically the de facto PC gaming platform. It’s had to get help on <a href="https://www.andrews-cooper.com/tech-talks/valve-partnership-gaming-hardware-development/">hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#:~:text=The%20Steam%20Deck%20was%20%E2%80%94%20and%20is%20%E2%80%94%20a%20distributed%20effort">software</a> and has worked with other companies to have them build Steam <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">boxes</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs">controllers</a>. (The company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">flat structure</a> may have something to do with it, too.)</p><p>Valve’s small staff is also something that’s been a sticking point for Wolfire. When it filed its lawsuit in 2021, Wolfire alleged that Valve “...devotes a miniscule percentage of its revenue to maintaining and improving the Steam Store.” Valve, as a private company, doesn’t have to share its headcount or financials, but Wolfire estimated that Valve had roughly 360 employees (a number likely sourced from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-misses-deadline-to-respond-to-washington-state-gambling-regulator-but-says-its-coming-soon/">Valve itself in 2016</a>) and that per-employee profit was around $15 million per year.</p><p>Even if that $15 million number isn’t exactly right, Valve, in its <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf">public employee handbook</a>, says that “our profitability per employee is higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft.” A document from the Wolfire lawsuit revealed <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-tim-sweeneys-epic-rant-to">Valve employees discussing</a> just how much higher — though the specific number for Valve employees is redacted.</p><p>While we haven’t seen any leaked profit numbers from this new headcount and payroll data, the figures give a more detailed picture of how much Valve is spending on its staff — which, given the massive popularity of Steam, is probably still just a fraction of the money the company is pulling in. </p><p>Valve didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. After we reached out, the court pulled the document from the docket.</p><p><em>Sean Hollister contributed reporting.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em><strong>Update, July 13th</strong>: Clarified why two table headings include “presumably.”</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-is-free-to-play-until-19-july-for-foundation-festival/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Courtesy of Cloud Imperium, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-update-is-live-adding-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr/">Star Citizen</a> once again offers free access to anyone who wants to test out the game from 12 July through 19 July. This comes with the annual Foundation Festival, so it's the perfect time to try out the game.</p>
<p>This festival introduces an expanded player experience for new and returning players. It features an inclusive Guide system that connects seasoned players with newcomers so that they can feel safe and included during their play time at Star Citizen. These players will be responsible for showing the newbies the ropes and helping them learn how to explore space.</p>
<p>Additionally, for those who decide to enjoy Star Citizen during the free-to-play period, three starting bundles will be discounted so that you don't have to grind for ages to get resources. These bundles are perfect for those who want to get a bit of a head start.</p>
<p>The Foundation Festival is a "civic program in-lore" designed to bring players together and create a positive community spirit. It runs from July 13 to July 31. The new guide system will be available to players from wherever they start within Star Citizen. It will slowly ease players into the game before introducing them to more advanced techniques.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is also a referral program. If you are already a player of Star Citizen, and there is someone you want to invite to play the game during Star Citizen's free-to-play period, you can give them your unique referral link to use so that as they register, any progress they make or any time spent in-game will give you rewards for convincing them to sign up to the game. It also benefits them, as they will be given 5,000 UEC (United Earth Credits), which can be spent on various customizations.</p>
<p>However, you will only reap the rewards once someone who has used your referral link purchases a bundle for the game worth at least 40 USD. From this, you'll earn 1 Recruitment Point. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/referral-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Robert Space Industries website</a> explains all the reward tiers and what you will be given to convince another player to take to the skies.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Foundation Festival is already live, meaning you can get stuck into the game using the free-to-play install on Steam if you choose to. While it may seem overwhelming to get stuck into such a gigantic game, there are plenty of resources available on their website to help you track your progress, as well as the new guide system where you can team up with Star Citizen veterans to get the best tips and tricks out there.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium aims to release the long-awaited Pyro star system later in 2024, which is governed by gangs and clans. As for Squadron 42, the campaign mode of Star Citizen <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been in the polishing phase since last October</a>. Fans are certainly hoping to get an update at this year's CitizenCon, scheduled at Manchester Central on October 19-20.</p>

			<p>A new stable build of the PCSX2 PlayStation 2 emulator was released online, introducing a huge number of changes and improvements over the previous stable build released back in 2020.</p>
<p>The 2.0 build, which can be downloaded from the emulator's <a href="https://pcsx2.net/downloads">official website</a>, introduces, among other things, an improved interface, automatic game fixes, per-game settings, a big picture mode for couch players, support for community-sourced translation, improved patch format, and more.</p>
<p>The new version of the PCSX2 emulator also introduces a couple of new features that should improve emulation for all users, such as the Automatic Renderer, which automatically chooses which renderer works best for different GPU architectures. The new version of the emulator also brings graphics and performance improvements, thanks to improvements to blending and ghosting issues present in multiple titles and texture replacements, which allow users to dump textures from any game, enhance them, and then load them back.</p>
<p>Finally, PCSX2 2.0 also brings emulation improvements for some problematic titles like Burnout, Ratchet and Clank, Destroy All Humans!, Ace Combat, and others. Rounding up the huge list of improvements are also sound and controller mapping enhancements, which include a very handy automatic mapping function.</p>
<p>More information on the PCSX2 2.0 build can be found on its<a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/"> official website.</a></p>

			<p>A new mod called The Witcher 3 Quests Extended has been uploaded today <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9360?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a> by modder PaulR0013. As hinted by its name, it will add fifteen brand new quests to CD Projekt RED's best-selling action RPG. Here's how they work, according to the modder:</p>
<p><em>These quests activate at different times and involve a variety of activities. Some are fairly quick to complete, while others can span large chunks of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>It is important to understand what this mod does. There are many activities in The Witcher 3, and while these activities often result in rewards and sometimes unique interactions and dialog, they are not tracked in the journal and do not have notifications to help the player complete them. Also, some of them are highly missable. What this mod does is turn these activities into quests by wrapping brand-new (unique) quests around the activities. When the activity is triggered, this mod will open the quest and provide tracking via objectives, maps, and new lore in the journal descriptions. This is intended to increase immersion and engagement for the player.</em></p>
<p>Two of the quests are related to Gwent (the card minigame later spun off <a href="https://wccftech.com/gwent-the-witcher-card-game-support-will-end-in-2023-cd-projekt-red-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into its own standalone game</a>), while others are enabled by crafting oils, potions, and decoctions. To install The Witcher 3 Quests Extended, download the content from Nexus, extract the contents of dlcW3QE to your Witcher3\DLC folder and the contents of modW3QE to your Witcher3\Mods folder.</p>
<p>The installation process hasn't been tested with a mod manager, so your mileage may vary if you want to use that method. Moreover, the mod was crafted for the Next-Gen version of The Witcher 3, but the author believes it should work with the old version, too.</p>
<p>Both The Witcher 3 DLCs (Hearts of Stone and Blood &amp; Wine) are mandatory to play The Witcher 3 Quests Extended. Translations from English are available in all languages supported by the game, although only Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Czech, and Russian were made manually, while the rest were created via Google Translate. The modder recommends installing these mods to get the optimal experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7329">Brothers in Arms</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7488">DLC Events</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7185">Grammar of the Path</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Following CD Projekt RED's release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDkit modding tool</a>, there might be a wealth of The Witcher 3 content mods on the way from the community. That's great for franchise fans, as the official new game from the studio, codenamed Polaris, is probably still at least a couple of years off; full production with a massive team of over 400 developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/witcher-4-polaris-production-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is just starting</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-saudi-arabia-in-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The International Olympics Committee only recently established the Olympic Esports Games, and it will vote on its establishment on the eve of the Paris Olympics 2024. Additionally, it has proposed that the Olympic Esports Games be held in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The partnership between the IOC and the Saudi NOC will last 12 years, and the Olympic Esports Games will be hosted regularly. "By partnering with the Saudi NOC, we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the program, the promotion of gender equality, and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing exports," says IOC President Thomas Bach.</p>
<p>This partnership is good news for <a href="https://wccftech.com/saudi-arabia-to-spend-38-billion-on-creating-local-gaming-hub/">Saudi Arabia</a>, which has been working steadily to change its socioeconomic status under Vision 2030. Since 2018, they have been responsible for hosting some of the most significant sporting events for both male and female athletes, as well as multiple esports events.</p>
<p>Now that the decision has been made to host the Olympic Esports Games in Saudi Arabia, the country will begin the process of choosing a city and a venue for the event. It must also consider what game titles to include and a specific date and time for the inaugural event.</p>
<p>In previous events, there has been an uproar about hosting them in Saudi Arabia due to their restrictive LGBTQ+ laws, as it is illegal to be homosexual in Saudi Arabia, and any public displays of affection can lead to lashings or the death penalty. Large organizations have previously been unable to secure the safety of LGBTQ+ players in Saudi Arabia, and it comes as a questionable choice to host the Olympic Esports Games in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>For example, if they choose to add Apex Legends to the program, it will be hugely controversial and contradictory, as the game is full of LGBTQ+ characters and plenty of pride. Additionally, there are many talented eSports players within the community, and at present, it remains unknown whether or not they can participate in the Olympic Esports Games or whether they will even be safe in such a country.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee has released <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a complete statement</a> on the official Olympics website detailing its plans for the agreement with Saudi Arabia and its commitment to equality for gender rights across the Olympic Esports Games.</p>

			<p>Mortal Kombat Remasters might be in the works at New York-based studio&nbsp;Eyeballistic.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the studio's CEO appears to <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1811469074695692764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hint</a> at via X. For those in the unknown - Eyeballistic consists of several developers, designers, artists, programmers as well as enthusiasts responsible for the MKHD fan project from several years back. Unfortunately, this fan project never saw the light. "We're the team behind the MKHD fan project where we infamously appealed to series co-creator, Ed Boon, to remake the original MK games in HD", the team <a href="https://www.eyeballistic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> on the studio's website. "Though MK IP owner Warner Bros. initially gave our team the green light to work on the project, they abruptly changed their minds based on evidence it might cannibalize sales of their main line 2019 MK game thus ending Eyeballistic's involvement."</p>
<p>On X, however, CEO Joe Tresca has recently been sharing screenshots of, what looks to be, remastered versions of both the original Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II. We've included these shots below. "I'm not saying, but just saying, we might be cooking up something special over at Eyeballistic", the CEO <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1804358945915510879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X last month.</p>
<p>Some days ago, Tresca <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1811469074695692764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>: "Who can forget the game that started it all?", showing a screenshot of an AI-upscaled first Mortal Kombat. Granted, although visuals are vastly improved, there are plenty of issues with the character models. When asked about this on X, the CEO wrote that the project is still a 'work-in-progress'. He added that the issues will be "fixed". "It's all just WIP. I can point out at least 100 other issues with it. We'll fix it", Tresca <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1811476024682549733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>While this doesn't mean that Warner Bros. has now approved the remasters of the original Mortal Kombat games, it will be interesting to see how things go from here. We'll update you as soon as learn more about this project from Eyeballistic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-esports-world-cup-groups/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Rainbow Six Siege’s portion of the Esports World Cup is fast approaching, and now that every team has qualified, they’ve been added to one of two groups. It’s an intense roster, with the best Rainbow Six teams in the world finding a place front and centre at the most ambitious and valuable esports event in history. </p>



<p>From July 31 to August 4, Rainbow Six Siege will be one of the most talked-about games at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-ewc-groups-confirmed">Rainbow Six EWC Groups Confirmed</h2>



<p>It was a rocky qualification period for some teams. There were high expectations that C9 Beastcoast, the winners of the recent BLAST R6 Manchester Major, would qualify – but that wasn’t the case. The teams that they beat on their way to the trophy did, though.</p>



<p>Here are the groups:</p>



<p><strong>Group A</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>Luminosity</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>



<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Team Bliss</li>



<li>Talon Esports</li>



<li>Team Cruelty</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>DarkZero</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Wolves Esports</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Into the Breach</li>



<li>Bleed Esports</li>



<li>SCARZ</li>



<li>Geekay</li>
</ul>



<p>Team BDS narrowly missed winning the Manchester Major, falling short against Beastcoast in an intense grand final showdown. As one of the most storied and successful teams in Rainbow Six esports, there are some solid beliefs that Team BDS can go all the way in Riyadh.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that other teams don’t have a shot. Group B houses FURIA, the Brazilian side that recently re-entered the Rainbow Six Siege scene after acquiring the dropped w7m Esports roster that won this year’s Six Invitational. FaZe Clan also sits in Group B – the runner-up at this year’s international tournament that took place in Sao Paulo.</p>



<p>It’s a veritable plethora of top-tier talent – by the start of August, we’ll know which team is the victor.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PCSX2 Team Reveals 2.0 Version of Emulation Software]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pcsx2-2-0-emulation-software-upgrade/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pcsx2-team-reveals-2-0-version-of-emulation-software.926427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pcsx2-2-0-emulation-software-upgrade/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>PCSX2 was released in 2002, emerging as a fledgling PS2-focused emulation platform. Today, it’s one of the leading emulators in the gaming world, but as a recent blog post from the core team supporting the open-source software recognised, ‘it has been over four years since the last stable PCSX2 revision released.’</p>



<p>With that in mind, a budding team of developers have taken PCSX2 and <strong>finally </strong>created a 2.0 version of the client, making several critical improvements to the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-retro-time">Retro Time</h2>



<p>If you’re able to get your hands on a PS2 BIOS (hint: it’s illegal to download one), then you can throw it onto a computer and configure it in PCSX2, getting access to a library of top retro titles. That’s the core selling point of PCSX2, which is completely open-source and free to use.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a> on the PCSX2 site, it was revealed that so many updates have been done or lined up for the platform that it’s effectively a 2.0 version of the client. Here’s a snapshot list of everything detailed in the blog post:</p>



<ul>
<li>Refreshed UI</li>



<li>Removed Plugins</li>



<li>Automatic Game Fixes</li>



<li>Per-Game Settings</li>



<li>Wider Compatibility</li>



<li>Big Picture Mode</li>



<li>Community-Sourced Translations</li>



<li>Improved Patch Format</li>



<li>Graphics Improvements</li>



<li>FFMPEG Video Capture</li>



<li>Improved Audio</li>



<li>Better Controller Mapping</li>



<li>RetroAchievements Integration</li>
</ul>



<p>If that’s not enough to make the application worthy of a 2.0 title, I don’t know what is. It can be a little tricky for some users to figure out how to get their hands on a PS2 BIOS, which is the biggest sticking point when it comes to the adoption of PCSX2, but it’s certainly doable, provided you have your own PS2 console to rip the BIOS from. It’s well worth doing – there’s nothing like going back in time to play your old favourites.</p>
