            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Subnautica 2 </em>has been at the center of a contentious debate between leadership at its developer Unknown Worlds and the game’s publisher, Krafton Games. At stake is a $250 million payout, promised to Unknown Worlds if the studio hit certain revenue targets by the end of this year. But a company shakeup and the subsequent delay of <em>Subnautica 2 </em>has rocked the studio and potentially imperiled the promised payout.</p><p>On July 2nd, Krafton announced that Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> developer Striking Distance Studios <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">would be taking over as the CEO of Unknown Worlds</a>, replacing the current leadership of Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire with immediate effect. </p><p>The following week, on July 9th, Unknown Worlds announced that <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">early access for <em>Subnautica 2</em> would be delayed to 2026</a>. According to the announcement, <em>Subnautica 2</em> was in good shape, but closed testing revealed “some insight that there are a few areas where we needed to improve before launching the first version of<em> Subnautica 2</em> to the world.” </p><p>That same day, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout">reported that</a> this delay was against the wishes of Unknown Worlds’ former leadership and that there were serious financial implications for this delay. According to Schreier’s report, when Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds, in 2021 it promised a $250 million bonus to the studio if it hit revenue targets by the end of 2025. Schreier’s reporting also indicated that the bonus was planned to be shared among the studio’s roughly 100 employees with some being promised bonuses in the seven figures. </p><p>With <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s delay, those revenue targets will likely not be hit, and those bonuses not paid out. In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Krafton said the delay was only to improve <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s quality, and it’s possible to envision a situation where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703373/krafton-delay-subnautica-2-250-million-bonus">Krafton delayed the game in order to get out of paying out the bonus</a>.</p><p>However, Krafton has issued a new statement that seemingly throws cold water over this interpretation. The statement says that Krafton had “allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives” with the “expectation” that the executives would “demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>.” The statement then accuses the ousted leadership of essentially abandoning development on the game while affirming “fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees.”</p><div><p>Here’s the statement in full, which you can <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/">also see on Krafton’s website</a>.</p></div><div><blockquote><p>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</p><p><strong><em>— </em></strong> <strong><em>Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</em></strong></p><p>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</p><p><strong>Background of Leadership Change </strong></p><p>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</p><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</p><p><strong>KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team </strong></p><p>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</p><p><strong>KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees </strong></p><p>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</p><p>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</p><p><strong>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</strong></p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704606/subnautica-2-delay-krafton-unknown-worlds-bonus]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once Superman, always Superman.</p><p>For a generation of kids too young to catch Christopher Reeve’s Superman run in the ’80s, ABC’s <em>Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</em> served as their introduction to the invincible titan. That means Dean Cain was many people’s first exposure to a live-action Superman—and he’s not too happy with James Gunn’s recent comments about the hero being an immigrant.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Gunn recently told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sunday Times</em></a></span> that Superman’s story reflects the American experience, saying the son of Krypton is “an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.” Well, that got Cain’s retired red trunks in a bunch. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/09/superman-dean-cain-immigrant-controversy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/09/superman-dean-cain-immigrant-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Cain didn’t hold back his criticism, claiming that labeling the hero an immigrant will prove to be a misstep.</p><p>“I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it’s an immigrant thing, and I think it’s going to hurt the numbers on the movie. I was excited for the film. I am excited to see what it is… I’m rooting for it to be a success, but I don’t like that last political comment.”</p><p>Here’s Cain’s issue: he’s tired of Disney and Hollywood retrofitting legacy characters like Superman and Snow White with modern ideologies that, in his view, align with current political trends but strip those characters of their original, innocent essence. Put simply, he’s tired of his favorite characters becoming—wait for it—“woke.”</p><p>To Cain, Superman has always stood for “truth, justice, and the American way,” but only the American way of decades past—not the modern one, which he suggests is compromised by too much immigration.</p><p>“You can’t come in saying, ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America because I want it to be more like Somalia.’ Well, that doesn’t work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here…There have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States. We can’t have everybody—society will fail. So there have to be limits.”</p><p>But Cain seems to be ignoring a few key facts. First, Superman is <em>literally</em> an alien, and U.S. immigration law considers anyone who isn’t a citizen or national of the United States an “alien.” In fact, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has an entire section dedicated to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alien Registration Requirements</a></span>.</p><p>Secondly, <em>Smallville</em> had an entire episode in which Clark Kent (Tom Welling) confronts his mother about her hypocritical stance—wanting to report an undocumented immigrant to authorities but not doing the same when Clark crash-landed on their farm. To leave nothing open to interpretation, Clark explicitly says, “I’m an illegal immigrant, Mom.”</p><p>At the end of the day, no matter how beloved a character may be, their identity is at the discretion of whoever owns their copyright. If one day Kevin Feige decides Iron Man should be a priest, or Thor an Indian bus driver, or Doctor Doom a pediatrician, then that’s what they’ll be.</p><p>To rephrase what Jay-Z once said: If you want old Superman, watch old Superman movies.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-movie-james-gunn-dean-cain-immigrant-1851786076]]></content:encoded>

The warrant for the takedown was issued from a US District Court in Georgia.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't been shy about its increased efforts to combat piracy, especially since the launch of Switch 2 last month. Several users found out the hard way that placing an MIG Switch cartridge inside the Switch 2 led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-put-this-cartridge-in-your-nintendo-switch-2-or-itll-be-banned-from-online/1100-6532574/" data-ref-id="1100-6532574">a permanent ban from going online</a>. The MIG Switch cartridge can hold ROMs from both legal and illegal origins, but Nintendo doesn't seem to be interested in tolerating either source. Once a Switch 2 console is flagged for using a MIG Switch, the ban can't be reversed because the cartridge violates Nintendo's terms of service.</p><p>Perhaps as a warning to other copyright infringers, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo went the extra mile to track down an alleged Switch pirate</a> last year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-blames-subnautica-dev-founders-for-subnautica-2-delay-claims-they-%E2%80%9Cabandoned%E2%80%9D-their-roles.1240854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Krafton, the parent company of Subnautica and Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, announced that the three studio founders, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were no longer with the studio</a>, and that they would be replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head, Steve Papoutsis. </p>



<p>What followed were <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">reassurances</a> from the remaining Unknown Worlds team that Subnautica 2's development was still in good hands as players suddenly had concerns now that three of the studio's core members were gone, and that the team was "<em>extremely proud</em>" of what they were building with Subnautica 2. Cleveland also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">published a lengthy farewell statement</a> to the game's community, claiming that Subnautica 2 was ready to release in early access before the end of 2025, and that his and his two other co-founders' departures were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</p>



<p>Then, a little less than a week later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a> published a report that claimed that Subnautica 2 was delayed into 2026, just as Unknown Worlds was nearing revenue targets that would have netted the studio a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus,</a> per the agreement they signed when Krafton acquired Unknown Worlds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">2021</a>. With Subnautica 2 pushed into 2026, members of the team at Unknown Worlds felt that the revenue goals it was meant to hit between 2021 and 2025 were now "<em>unattainable</em>," and it seemed that Krafton's decision to delay the early access launch might have stemmed from the company wanting to avoid paying the large bonus.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Subnautica 2 - &quot;Take a Deep Breath&quot; (Gameplay Reveal Teaser)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hours after Bloomberg's initial report, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">Krafton denied that the decision to delay the game came from any financial considerations or contract obligations</a>, and Unknown Worlds confirmed that Subnautica 2 was delayed into 2026. The reason given for the delay pointed to feedback from an internal playtest, though according to Bloomberg's report, at an internal meeting, Papoutsis told the development team that Krafton's leaders believed Subnautica 2 needed more content before it could launch in early access.</p>



<p>Now, the story has become even more muddled, as <a href="https://krafton.com/en/">Krafton published a lengthy statement of its own</a>, in which it points the finger directly at Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, claiming that the three co-founders "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio and their responsibilities, and that the blame falls to them for Subnautica 2 still not being out in early access. It calls their removal "<em>inevitable</em>" and "<em>necessary</em>" based on their actions and alleged refusal to fulfill their roles at the studio.</p>



<p>Krafton also claims that 90% of the $250 million bonus was going straight to the three co-founders, "<em>with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership</em> <em>and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2,"</em> the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an early access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game director and technical director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current early access version also falls short in terms of content volume. We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</em>"</p>



<p>Krafton goes on to say that it has "<em>committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development</em>,<em>"</em> and that it has reaffirmed "<em>our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised</em>."</p>



<p>Along with his initial report on Bloomberg, author Jason Schreier added that per documentation he received regarding the $250 million bonus, 10% of it was to be allocated between 40 members of the Unknown Worlds development team, all to receive varying amounts. He also said that the co-founders had intended to give some of their bonuses to other employees.</p>







<p>This has easily grown to become one of the year's more unbelievable stories so far, and it wouldn't be a surprise at this point if it evolved into a legal battle. We'll update this story as it develops. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wild Hearts Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Hearts originally launched in February 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, the game was published by EA under its EA Originals label, though this Switch 2 version is published by Koei Tecmo (so an EA account won't be needed for multiplayer). The developer behind Wild Hearts S is Omega Force, best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While Wild Hearts S is clearly inspired by the Monster Hunter series, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-hearts-6-ways-its-different-from-monster-hunter/1100-6511581/">plenty of ways the game is different</a>. For instance, the game utilizes automatons called Karakuri that let players build blocks to climb as well as create zip lines to quickly get across environments.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/" data-ref-id="1900-6418030">Wild Hearts review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>' seventh birthday celebrations back in March, developer Rare has cast its spyglass toward new horizons, outlining its vision for the multiplayer pirate adventure's future in its first-ever Community Direct livestream. And those plans include the introduction of multi-ship private servers and paid custom servers "early" next year.
</p>
<p>
Today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">stream</a> wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of affairs, despite its hour-long runtime, but it did see Rare admitting to having dropped the ball in terms of game health and narrative momentum in recent years. Both are things it's talked about before, but it's now detailed some of the ways it hopes to keep players onboard as Sea of Thieves sails into year eight and beyond.
</p>
<p>
To that end, the studio talked at length about "finding balance" between introducing new features, reinvigorating and expanding some of Sea of Thieves' neglected legacy systems - including the likes of captaincy, hourglass battles, and guilds - tackling long-standing bugs and issues, and implementing some of the community's most-requested features.

<p>
As to what that'll look like in practical terms, from Sea of Thieves' upcoming Season 17 onward, seasons will "focus more consistently on reaching a broader set of player motivations". That means a mix of new stuff, revisiting previous content to "tease out more value", plus a renewed sense of narrative and world-building to ensure seasons are "always moving the world forward". The studio did, however, stress story won't be "front and centre", implying the likes of Tall Tales and long-abandoned Adventures are now well and truly a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Season 17, each three-month-long season will follow a fixed pattern: month one will focus on "reinvigorating the sandbox" and "stirring the pot around a theme and a set of motivations" to keep things fresh; month two will bring an "expanded approach to live events", while month three will introduce some kind of community call to action. Additionally, recurring seasonal events will now be run on a more predictable schedule: Community Weekends, for instance, will take place during the first month of a season, and Gold and Glory in the third.
</p>
<p>
Using the upcoming Season 17: Smugglers' Tide as an example, Rare's revised plan means month one will bring the new Smugglers faction, new hideouts around the world, new smuggling runs that reward players for ferrying dangerous cargo, and a refresh for the likes of shipwrecks and skeleton ships, which will both harbour valuable smuggler cargo.

<p>
Month two introduces a new heist-inspired live event, bringing the community together to battle over a sea fort location (Rare notes these live events won't be one-and-done, but will instead enter some sort of rotation), and month three gives Skeleton Forts a Reaper-themed makeover. So alongside the likes of a new loot pool, players can anticipate being invaded by the Dark Brethren and their ghost ships mid-battle, switching crews' role from invaders to defenders. All that and a narrative thread to bring the whole season together.
</p>
<p>
And that'll be the seasonal template players can expect from here on out. Season 18, for instance, is aiming to revitalise Sea of Thieves' long-neglected Devil's Roar area, introducing a banished faction of Dark Ancients, hidden shrines, a new ancient threat, plus reinvigorated Emissary gameplay. Beyond that, things are a lot vaguer, with Rare teasing a "multi-year" vision it'll talk about in the next Community Direct, in six months' time.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to Rare's final reveal: confirmation that custom servers - AKA Custom Seas - are coming in "early 2026". These are set to feature a host of options and toggles, enabling players to turn off the likes of the kraken or storms, spawn in chests, break current crew limits, and more. They'll also include access to the tools Rare uses to make its trailers, including a cinematic camera. The catch is all this is being labelled as a "premium" feature, and will require a regular subscription to access - Rare's justification being that custom servers are expensive to develop, maintain, and continue evolving.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Sea of Thieves' Safer Seas mode - which essentially gives a single ship and its crew access to a private server version of the game, albeit one with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-is-finally-letting-private-server-players-earn-full-rewards-starting-in-december">some restrictions</a> - will be expanded to allow fleets of friends to sail together. This announcement came amid Rare's chatter of custom servers, and it's not entirely clear if this is a free addition or if it'll require the custom server subscription. I've asked Microsoft for clarification.
</p>
<p>
Sea of Thieves' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">inaugural Community Direct</a> is a fairly meandering thing, but probably still worth a watch for some insight into Rare's thinking (there's also talk of an overhaul for its long-running Insiders programme, which includes the ditching of its NDAs and the ushering in of a new spoiler-filled future), just don't expect much in the way of specific reveals.
</p>
<p>
Today's Sea of Thieves Community Direct does, of course, follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping layoffs and project cancellations across Microsoft and its Xbox division</a> last week. One <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">notable casualty was Rare's fantasy action-adventure Everwild</a>, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">all the way back in 2019</a>. In the wake of its cancellation, Rare veteran Gregg Mayles - who directed the likes of Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie before helming Everwild - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">confirmed to be departing the studio</a> after 35 years.

          <p>In 2019, Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2019/5/16/18627669/nintendo-switch-online-game-vouchers-deal">announced</a> a new benefit for subscribers to its Switch Online service: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">a pair of game vouchers</a>, available for $100, that could be redeemed for any two Switch games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=pd&amp;p=0">Nintendo's eligibility list</a>. If you already knew you were going to be buying first-party games, the voucher could save you $20, or even $30, if you used it on the normally $70 <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo announced today that it will soon end the program, rather than carrying it forward into the Switch 2 era. Switch Online subscribers can still buy a pair of vouchers until the end of January 2026, and those vouchers will be redeemable for up to a year after purchase, but you can't buy new vouchers after that.</p>
<p>The vouchers were already notably&nbsp;<em>not</em> usable to buy Switch 2-exclusive games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. However, for hybrid Switch games with a separate Switch 2 Edition, you could still use them to buy a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and then upgrade it to the Switch 2 edition separately.&nbsp;Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">said on its FAQ page</a> that new titles would be added to the eligibility list between now and January 2026, raising the possibility that upcoming high-profile hybrid games like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> or&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>could make the list.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Each game (aside from Caribbean Crashers) comes from the same publisher, Slitherine, which is currently hosting a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/Slitherine25thAnniversaryPublisherSale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">25th anniversary sale on Steam</a> and is known for publishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">strategy games</a>. The three free Slitherine games all sport "Very Positive" user reviews, with Battlestar Galactica Deadlock looking to be the most popular and well-received of the bunch.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Black Lab Games, players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlestar-galactica-deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-464881">Battlestar Galactica Deadlock</a> take control of the Colonial Fleet during the First Cylon War and strategize their way to victory in turn-based, 3D space battles.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> housing system will see players level-up their homes by completing neighborhood-wide events called Endeavors, ones that will visually change neighborhoods and offer special decorations for a limited-time.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed those new details about the MMORPG's highly anticipated housing system and more in a recent <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24221516" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. While Blizzard already announced players would be buying homes as part of either public or private neighborhoods, now we know more about how exactly it will all work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One key part of WoW's neighborhoods will be Endeavors. These neighborhood-wide events occur about once a month and visually transform the neighborhood to represent different cultures or factions found in Azeroth. Each Endeavor will introduce tasks that can be completed by those living in the neighborhood, ranging from competing quests to crafting certain items or finishing dungeons. Once enough tasks are completed collectively, the whole neighborhood is rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing an Endeavor's tasks come with two main rewards: a special currency used to purchase themed decorations from visiting Endeavor NPCs and Neighborhood Favor. It's the latter reward that looks to serve as housing XP of sorts, leveling up what looks to be a housing version of the game's Renown track system. Each new housing level grants new decoration items and sometimes will even increase housing limitations, like how many decorations a player can have in their house.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of Endeavors is to give neighborhoods common goals to strive for, add choices for how a neighborhood looks, and also introduce asymmetry between different neighborhoods, as not all neighborhoods will be working on the same Endeavor. While players in public neighborhoods will have their Endeavors essentially chosen for them, those in private neighborhoods will be able to choose from a selection of possible Endeavors. This allows for players to visit different neighborhoods and purchase Endeavor decoration rewards that might not be available in their own neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's housing level system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Along with announcing Endeavors, Blizzard additionally answered some common questions it has heard from players, like how to move homes if a player doesn't like living in a place or next to a particular person, or how much control players will have over who can visit their home.</p><p dir="ltr">If a player doesn't like where they are living, they can just pick up their house and move. Blizzard said it's made changing home locations "frictionless and straightforward." Giving up a home will save its state, after which players can then "unpack" that home at a new location without having to redecorate or rebuild the home's interior. Homes in WoW are essentially magic boxes that can be as big or small as a player wants, so not having to redo previous work sounds like a smart move.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard emphasized that neighborhoods are quite large in size, with 50 housing plots spread across different biomes within the zone. Some homes will be more isolated for those who want to live the hermit lifestyle without neighbors, while others will be part of small or large cul-de-sacs that encourage more social interaction.</p><p dir="ltr">As for home permissions, Blizzard is giving players ultimate control over who can visit, with options for allowing (or denying) friends, guildmates, neighbors, or the general public. There will also be an option for allowing people to visit the outside plot of a home, but not come inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Details about Endeavors and neighborhoods are just the latest information Blizzard has shared about player housing, having previously shared its insights on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's houses will be available for everyone who wants one</a>, how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/" data-ref-id="1100-6531163">housing system will reward past achievements</a>, and all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">nitty-gritty decoration options</a> players will have.</p><p dir="ltr">In May, GameSpot was among the first to go <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on with WoW's housing decoration tools</a>, and we came away impressed at the possibilities it offered, even in an early, unfinished state.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's housing system was announced to be coming as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMO's next expansion, Midnight</a>, but is now expected to arrive ahead of it, perhaps as part of the expansion's pre-patch update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a pair of pants that are almost 11 years old. They’re light olive, made from a very lightweight form of nylon and at this point acceptably shabby. I have kept them this long for two reasons: I spent a decent amount of money on them, and they’re so well made that I couldn’t kill them unless I actively tried. This is the reason why Outlier is the only company that I trust for men’s pants.</p><p>If you have never met me, you should know that I’m a large guy, hovering between 6’1” and 6’2” depending on how bad my posture is on any given day. Prior to getting into Outlier, my plan in my shithead 20s era was to buy whatever pair of Uniqlo jeans fit me, get them <a href="https://faq-us.uniqlo.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Alterations-for-In-Store-Purchases/?l=en_US&amp;fs=RelatedArticle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hemmed for free at the store</a> and then drive them into the dirt until the crotch exploded from the force of my quadriceps.&nbsp;</p><p>A few things changed. The first is that I developed a fashion sense. It helped that there were a lot of very good sample sales in New York City, providing a steady drip of fashion pieces for my broke ass. The other was that I got tired of fast fashion failing me constantly. New York City is notoriously hard on clothes; it’s nasty here, and I wanted pants that would not get immediately ruined after a year of being subjected to the weather and grime.</p><figure><figcaption>I was able to track down the exact moment I started wearing these pants.</figcaption></figure><p>I cannot remember how Outlier came on my radar, but at the time they were a company with a goal of making clothes durable enough to withstand the abuse of a cycling commute, similar to Levi’s Commuter line, but that fashioned in a manner presentable enough for an office job. The cycling angle has faded over time (in part because it has become easier to cycle in the city), but the commitment to performance fabrics and construction has not. Outlier still prides themselves on using good materials to an obsessive degree, constantly trying to find some technical fabric from Japan or one that is borderline impossible to source on a consumer level. The majority of their clothing has traditionally lacked a logo, theirs being a simple silhouette of a black swan, although they’ve gotten slightly bolder on including (easy to remove) tags on newer items. Outlier’s basics are what William Gibson would describe as “CPUs” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayce_Pollard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cayce Pollard Units</a> in the book <em>Pattern Recognition</em>: reliable standards that lack any external branding worn by the logo-allergic protagonist Cayce Pollard.</p><figure><figcaption>They only recently started adding logos to their stuff, and they are all fairly easy to remove.</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever treated yourself to something nice and realized you’re never going to be able to buy the worse alternative ever again? That’s what happened when I bought my pair of lightweight <a href="https://archive-m2.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/futureworks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futureworks</a>. Not only were they comfortable, water resistant and well made, they also fit my body perfectly. But probably the most important part was how they were stitched together. Many mens pants are sewn in such a way as to tear directly down the middle, while the Futureworks had a gusseted crotch - a piece of fabric sewn to the natural stress point of the crotch that removes that tension from the equation. That, combined with the fact that they were made out of fairly strong, slightly stretchy nylon, has made them a durable staple.</p><figure><figcaption>Nice basics from left to right: SDs, New Way Seven Fives, Futuredarts. CreditOutlier</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually the Futureworks would be supplanted by the <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futuredarts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futuredarts</a>, which would further refine the pants by adding <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futuredarts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darting to them</a>. Outlier does a fairly good job at keeping a comprehensive archive of their old lines of clothing online, so you can easily track the evolution of the brand as it changes over time. Other reliable standards are the Slim Dungarees, a slightly more durable pair of pants than the Futuredarts. Outlier probably has some of the most reliable mens shorts in the game in various cuts, which include an internal drawstring. My favorite pants of all are the Injected Linen Pants, an extremely breathable pair perfect for summer, stitched from a <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/injected-linen-pants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyester/linen</a> blend that is far more delicate than their standard fare but also leagues more practical than linen pants tend to be.</p><figure><figcaption>Injex is the Outlier's delicate fabric and my favorite, a slightly durable poly/linen blend that withstands more abuse than standard linen.</figcaption></figure><p>At the time of writing you’re looking at paying $125-$200 for a pair of shorts or pants, and be warned that if you decide to venture outside of the basics you will pay a hefty premium for it. That said, I have bought so many pairs of pants over the years, particularly from their seasonal grab bag sales dubbed “WTF” (you pay them 50 bucks, give them a waist size, and they send you something in that size), that I have a wardrobe in basically every waist size I have fit into.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Every time Outlier has roulette style sample sale I have bought a pair in basically every size I can fit in. </figcaption></figure><p>It is a strange thing to write about a company this way, but Outlier is, in a bit of nominative determinism, singular. They have held on to the 2010s direct to consumer model while many startups from that time have largely discarded this concept. Their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subreddit</a> benefitted from an <a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/from-radical-quality-to-reddit-how-fashion-brand-outlier-is-charting-its-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influx of traffic</a> that helped them build a following there and gave them a step up. This community would in turn help shape their tastes and give them feedback, and the board felt truly conversational for many years. Outlier embodied the zeitgeist of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techwear</a> community in its dedication to technical fabrics, although they have been generally much better at putting out pieces that don’t feel anchored to that movement and have in some ways outlived it. If you were to describe their current aesthetic, it would be a shockingly coherent venn diagram of rave wear, sensible office basics and LaKeith Stanfield’s wardrobe in the Netflix <em>Death Note </em>movie. That’s perfect because that’s how I dress most of the time anyway.</p><figure><figcaption>On top of basics, Outlier frequently has limited, experimental, and expensive drops. Guy Fieri shorts in space age linen? Fluorescent sun hoodies? It's always a joy to see. Credit: Outlier</figcaption></figure><p>The strangest part about following Outlier’s trajectory is how it has mirrored and informed my own obsessions with materials. Even outside of synthetics, they have a love of linen and merino from a purely technical perspective. Outlier is one of the only western companies I’ve seen that regularly makes clothes out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramie</a>, a Chinese bast fiber that is better at cooling than linen but that I have heard is a pain in the ass to work with. Outlier, like everyone else including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/our-dwr-problem/story-17791.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patagonia</a>, had to deal with the thorny issue of replacing PFAS for use in durable water repellents (also known as DWR), and following their trajectory as <a href="https://huntsman-pimcore.equisolve-dev.com/Documents/Zelan_R3_Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they figured out how to solve that</a> has been interesting as an enthusiast. Additionally, Outlier has historically had a fondness for <a href="https://www.polartec.com/fabrics/insulation/alpha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PolarTec Alpha</a>, an lightweight synthetic insulation that has the benefit of being highly breathable. PolarTec Alpha was used by Patagonia in its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822160605/https://www.patagonia.com/product/level-3a-jacket/19213.html?dwvar_19213_color=ALP&amp;cgid=web-specials-mens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Level 3A PCU</a> (Protective Combat Unit) jacket back when the company had more extensive collaborations with the US military. I bought that Patagonia jacket on clearance in part because Outlier was <a href="https://outlier.nyc/search?q=alpha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so obsessed with how well Alpha worked and has produced many garments with it</a>. The Level 3A has since become a mild collector’s item for guys who are obsessed with military gear, and I hate to say it is the closest thing I own to a perfect jacket.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Patagonia PCU Level 3A Light Loft Shell Wind Resistant Jacket" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqhiMhk8Bkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More than anything though, I am still shocked at how well their garments hold up. It’s not a flawless track record: I have a few garments with holes in some of the pockets, particularly from the time period when they moved to breathable mesh pockets which have some forgivable tradeoffs. The injected linen pants are as close as you can get to a perfect summer pant and have saved my ass in the 94 degree NYC heat, but they are slightly more frail than Outlier’s regular output by virtue of the material used. But those little exceptions to a rule exist side by side with a backlog of unkillable pants in my wardrobe, from the very baggy yet durable <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/bombdeux-standards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bombardeauxs</a> to the reliable <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/slim-dungarees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDs (Slim Dungarees)</a>, the closest thing Outlier has to a standard.&nbsp;</p><p>The other day during one of Aftermath’s editorial meetings, I told the rest of the site what I had been working on: a blog about a pair of pants. Prior to the meeting I had been doing some ambient farming of Citibike points for a few hours, cycling in a path that took me from Penn Station, past the cursed NYT building, through Times Square, down past Japan Society, and eventually taking the meeting on a bench in front of Stuyvusent Town. The day had gone from a dreary light rain to the oppressive summer armpit of a July in New York City. I was dehydrated and exhausted. As I told the Aftermath crew about “The Pants Blog,” I looked down and I saw that by pure coincidence I had done the entire ride in the green pants; the ones I love, that I had bought when Barack Obama was the president, and I smiled in the knowledge that I am still many years away from killing them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants]]></content:encoded>

But a fresh delay of one of the most wish-listed games on Steam makes that almost impossible.

Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds cofounders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill were fired last week, despite Krafton promising the studio independence when it was purchased back in 2022. Cleveland later wrote on Reddit that the game was ready to release in Early Access later this year as originally planned, calling the move from Krafton to replace the studio’s leadership a “shock.”</p><p>The publisher now says that the decision to delay <em>Subnautica 2 </em>grew out of negative feedback from playtests. “We received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game’s direction,” it wrote in its new statement. “At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release. As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience.”</p><p>Krafton was less diplomatic in a new statement published on its website Thursday afternoon which accused Cleveland and McGuire of refusing to return to their leadership roles on <em>Subnautica 2 </em>after the studio’s fantasy skirmish PVP game <em>Moonbreaker </em>struggled to find an audience last year. The publisher blamed them for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s failure to release in 2024 as originally planned:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them.<em> Subnautica 2</em> was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of <em>Moonbreaker</em>, Krafton  asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.<br>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.<br></p><p>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>The statement also said Krafton was “committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development,” though a spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately clarify what those bonuses would look like relative to the $250 million payout previously on the table (the publisher said only 10 percent of the payout was originally for developers on the studio floor).</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A developer update posted on YouTube</a></span> confirmed<em> Subnautica 2 </em>would be coming to Early Access in 2025 back in April. It’s unclear what would have meaningfully changed in just two months to lead Krafton to overrule the studio’s leadership and replace them, which has now jeopardized fan enthusiasm for the game in the process. “<em>Subnautica</em>’s soul has just been ripped out,” one fan recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lpryrg/subnauticas_soul_has_just_been_ripped_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lpryrg/subnauticas_soul_has_just_been_ripped_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. </p><p><em>Subnautica</em> players have  started revolting on the game’s subreddit.

                <p>A new challenger is rising in the ranks. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/" data-ref-id="5000-524231">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, the free-to-play sports sim game about horse girls, is racing up the Steam charts. The gacha game has been garnering attention since its launch in North America in June, thanks in part to streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce. It hit its all-time-peak of just over 50,000 simultaneous players yesterday, July 9, and has been boasting new personal bests day after day.</p><p>To put that number in perspective, that is just over double the number of concurrent players at launch. The game is now squarely in the top 50 most-played games on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3224770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. That puts it in competition with games like Elden Ring Nightreign and Warframe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby has been a phenomenon in Japan for a while, spawning tie-in anime, spin-off party games, and even a stage play. The titular Umamusume are women with a horse's speed and strength--they also sport pointy ears and tails. During the day, they race. At night, they perform in lavish pop concerts for their fans. The kicker is that each of the girl is based on an actual famous race horse. One of them, a lovable loser named Haru Urara, is still alive and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans have taking to visiting her at the farm</a> where she now lives. The developer even put out a statement about proper etiquette for <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visiting a stable</a>. It's bizarre things like this, the kind of fact that you couldn't say about any other game, that seem to be fueling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume's word-of-mouth momentum</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are familiar with social simulation games like Princess Maker or Idol Manager, you'll understand the basics of how Umamusume: Pretty Derby plays. Each horse girl starts with a set of aptitudes and stats which you can enhance through training. At races, they can prove their mettle and, if they place high enough, progress to tougher challenges. But it's not all work. Training is frequently interrupted by visual-novel-esque segments and storylines. However, to unlock your horse girl of choice you will have to engage with the game's plentiful gambling mechanics. At its heart, Umamusume is a game about collecting jpegs.

<p>We miss you, Iwata-san</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/185f185d49ca8/satoru-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p><em>"On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer".</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>11th July 2025 marks the 10th anniversary of Satoru Iwata's passing; a man who cemented himself as not only an exceptional leader during times of both success and failure, but a figurehead that would steal the hearts of countless fans around the world.</p>
<p>It's difficult to really say anything that hasn't already been expressed at some point in the last decade, but we think it's clear that Iwata's presence continues to be felt in both Nintendo circles and the gaming industry at large. Indeed, with the recent news of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-layoffs-begin-as-phil-spencer-shares-internal-microsoft-gaming-update">extensive layoffs from Xbox and Microsoft</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">turmoil at studios across the world</a> over the last couple of years, many have recounted the words spoken by Iwata during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/stock/meeting/130627qa/03.html">shareholder Q&amp;A session</a> in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, however, employee morale will decrease, and I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iwata also paved the way for the Switch — Nintendo's most successful home console of all time — having worked extensively on the system before his passing in 2015. The effects of this are still felt to this very day, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic2ez3ZoKAk">Nvidia paying tribute to Iwata in a recent video</a> on the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still remember the day Iwata-san shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no-one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"We lost Iwata-san before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work everyday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years ago, former NL editor Tom Whitehead <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/feature_remembering_satoru_iwata_five_years_on">wrote about Iwata's career and his legacy</a>, and it's strange to think that a full decade has now passed - and to consider how the world has changed in that time. We wonder what Iwata would make of the state of the industry, of Switch's success, and of the brand new console we're enjoying.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is, well, thank you, Iwata-san. Nintendo would not be where it is today without your leadership, passion, and desire to deliver the very best experiences in gaming.</p>
