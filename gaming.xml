Previously, the Xbox could only support up to 16TB of space on a single USB-connected drive.</p><p>With the new update, Xbox systems can now partition hard disks larger than 16TB into segments to use the full physical storage space. A single 24TB hard disk can now be formatted into multiple partitions (the largest still being 16TB) so you can archive more games, apps, and media than ever — if that’s something you’ve wanted to do.</p><p>However, if you have already been using a hard disk greater than 16TB with Xbox, the company says you’ll need to erase it first to take full advantage:</p><div><blockquote><p>Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives.</p></blockquote></div><p>Although you still can’t play current generation games directly off an external drive, it can be useful to back up all of your installs anyway, or games made for older systems. You won’t need to redownload entire titles such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">the 300GB-plus <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> using an internet connection when you feel like playing it again after a hiatus, unless they need an equally-sizable update.</p><p>Xbox is also releasing an update that enables new network quality indicators for cloud gaming sessions to tell you if your connection is slow and affecting your gameplay. They will appear in red bubbles on the upper right side of the screen, telling you what is happening, such as packet loss or increased ping, which can help you troubleshoot your connection.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One in 10 game developers lost their job in 2024. That’s according to the results of the annual <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Game Developers Conference state of the video game survey</a>. The survey sampled over 3,000 developers and covered a number of topics including industry layoffs and what kind of games developers are working on.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry">Prolific layoffs</a> have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record">ravaged the industry</a> over the last two years making the question of their impact on developers one of the most important in the survey. In addition to 10 percent of developers losing their jobs, 41 percent of respondents said they had been impacted by layoffs in some way, either by being laid off directly or seeing coworkers or colleagues in other departments let go. The survey also noted that the number of people impacted is potentially much higher because of the students and graduates who reported having a difficult time simply getting a job in the industry at all.</p><p>When asked what reason companies gave for layoffs, 22 percent said restructuring while 18 said declining revenue. 19 percent gave no reason at all. Developers, though, have their own ideas about why layoffs keep happening. In an analysis of responses to what developers think the reason behind layoffs is, the majority were general statements about the industry’s over-expansion during the pandemic. Companies acquired workers and studios in hopes of meeting a level of demand for games that dried up as covid restrictions loosened. However, some developers believe the reason for layoffs is much simpler. Companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283812/microsoft-q1-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215155/sony-sees-strong-gaming-growth-despite-weaker-ps5-sales">Sony</a> still reported growing revenues despite multiple rounds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">studio</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">closures</a>. It’s no surprise then that 13 percent of respondents attributed layoffs to corporate greed.</p><p>In addition to layoffs, the last few years have also seen the failure of a number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">high-profile, big-budget, live-service games</a>. While there has been some success in that area with new games like <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it’s generally tough to launch a live-service game that can compete with the overbearing likes of <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. 2024 was also the year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348727/balatro-5-million-copies-the-game-awards"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> dominated headlines and award lists suggesting a greater appetite for those kinds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox">smaller-scoped, single-player experiences. </a>It’s interesting, and perhaps concerning then, that according to the survey, over 30 percent of AAA developers are working on a live-service game.</p><p>When it asked developers their thoughts on live-service games the survey answered, “One of the biggest issues mentioned was market oversaturation, with many developers noting how tough it is to break through and build a sustainable player base.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-pro-didnt-notice-stickers-spelling-n-word-on-stream/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-pro-%E2%80%98didn%E2%80%99t-notice%E2%80%99-stickers-spelling-n-word-on-stream.1089135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-pro-didnt-notice-stickers-spelling-n-word-on-stream/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word on a Desert Eagle skin caught the attention of several viewers during a professional Counter-Strike 2 match broadcast. The CS2 player using the skin has addressed it, claiming that they didn’t realize what was being displayed.</p>



<p>While the player may not have noticed during the match, the CS2 community certainly did, and so did the tournament organizer.</p>



<hr>



<p>During an online match in the ESL Challenger League in Europe, 9Pandas player Vladislav “Krad” Kravchenko was spotted using a Desert Eagle with a pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word. The stickers are mirrored because Krad plays left-handed, but it’s still very clear what the original sticker placement was trying to do.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The sticker spelling resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1i6zt5e/9_pandas_krad_had_a_deagle_with_the_n_word_in_an/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> on the primary Counter-Strike subreddit, where many speculated that Krad received the skin recently in a trade, and wouldn’t know what was on it until getting into a game. On X, Krad <a href="https://x.com/Kradcs/status/1882033348199297031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> his explanation, claiming he had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-buy-counter-strike-skins-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought the skin</a> less than a week ago and didn’t notice the word spelled out because he plays left-handed.</p>



<p>When someone buys a skin through Steam or another market, the listing itself doesn’t include the sticker pattern. However, Steam and most markets offer players the option of inspecting the weapon in-game before buying. Additionally, the in-menu weapon inspection screen is always right-handed, even if the player’s settings are left-preferred, so an inspection would clearly show the inappropriate pattern.</p>



<p>The ability for players to have custom control over where they apply stickers was added almost a year ago. Immediately, players used the new feature to <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/cs2-devs-arent-mad-theyre-just-disappointed-in-nsfw-player-sticker-crafts">apply various NSFW words and designs</a>. On January 22, 2025, Krad <a href="https://t.me/kradcsgo/1531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> via his Telegram account that he has received a two week ban from ESL because of the Deagle.</p>

<p>Developer Don’t Nod has announced that Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2 has been delayed by a month. The announcement came on Wednesday via the <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>. </p>



<p>Tape 1, titled “Bloom”, is scheduled release on February 18th while Tape 2, “Rage”, is now set to launch on April 15 rather than March.</p>



<p>“We want to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“We feel that this extra time is necessary to ensure we deliver the experience players and fans deserve. We are confident that this delay will allow us to provide you with a richer experience and we can’t wait for you to live the full journey of Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat.”</p>



<p>Despite the delay, Don’t Nod says that they have “surprises” up their sleeves in between the release of Tape 1 and Tape 2. What those surprises are, however, wasn’t hinted at in the announcement. </p>



<p>Upon release, Tape 2 will be a free downloadable update for Lost Records.</p>



<p>Last October, Don’t Nod announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“reorganization project”</a>  in order to “safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem”. This project would would result in layoffs at the studio, though it’s unknown if that was part of the reason for the game’s delay.</p>



<p>When it does release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of the delay of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has shipped and BioWare is free to pour its resources into the fifth entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a> series, players are naturally getting excited. But according to former executive producer Mark Darrah, it'll take some time for BioWare to really get the game development wheels turning.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE">newly released video documenting the production of Veilguard</a>. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource. It had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]," Darrah continued. "You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto [work on] Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah worked for BioWare for 23 years, so although he may not be a current employee, he does likely have a pretty good idea of the studio's inner workings. At any rate, the lack of advertising for Mass Effect 5 also suggests that the game's development is still in its infancy. It was first announced in 2020, but it's been crickets from BioWare since then.</p><p dir="ltr">"This [decision to focus on one game at a time] might be great," Darrah said of BioWare's steady, focused approach to the game's development, "Because what it means is BioWare--for really the first time ever--is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all [its] attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."</p>

In addition to revealing insights on the wave of layoffs and increased interest in PC game development, the results show a major year-over-year shift in developer opinions on generative AI technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Specifically, developers are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>much</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> more pessimistic about tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and MidJourney than they were the prior year. In 2024, 21 percent of game developers thought generative AI would have a "positive" impact on the video game industry. In 2025, that number has dropped to 13 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the number of survey respondents who think it will have a "negative" impact on the industry increased from 18 percent to 30 percent. This change comes even as more developers report using generative AI tools, with the number rising from 31 percent in 2024 to 36 percent in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But one eye-opening slide shows who is adopting AI tools in game development—and for the most part, it's not the people programming or creating assets for games. The heaviest AI use showed up for those working in "Business &amp; Finance," at 50 percent of respondents. Next up were those in "Production &amp; Team Leadership" and "Community, Marketing, &amp; PR"&nbsp; at 40 percent of respondents each. Developers in all other departments reported less use.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data" target="_self" data-discover="true">Five takeaways from Matthew Ball's 2025 State of Gaming data</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why hasn't adoption reached the rank-and-file of game development yet? Well one respondent who answered the question "what concerns do you have about Generative AI, and what can be done to address them?" may have had the simplest answer—one that goes beyond the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/">ethical</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/generative-ai-is-scraping-your-data-so-now-what">concerns</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over using the technology. "No matter how you put it, generative AI isn't a great replacement for real people and quality is going to be damaged," this person said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="If developers aren't excited about AI tools, why are so many companies promoting them?">If developers aren't excited about AI tools, why are so many companies promoting them?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lack of enthusiasm from developers attending GDC is almost an inverse of the breathless hype surrounding generative AI in the broader marketplace. You'd think there would be more alignment if you take claims about the technology at face value. After all, boosted productivity and faster asset creation aren't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/owlchemy-labs-ceo-andrew-eiche-thinks-devs-should-be-bullish-about-ai">inherently bad things</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—developers have been creating tools to solve those problems for as long as there's been a video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It seems developers view AI tools as going beyond supporting productivity and creativity. "I think AI generated code is currently low quality, and can give rise to subtle bugs that the person using the AI doesn't understand," one respondent told GDC. "If the models advance far enough, this concern might go away, but I'm skeptical. I think right now developers are better [off] avoiding AI code, unless it is for something small like a one time use script."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People will end up having to review generated content rather than create things themselves, which is not what we all get into the industry for," another wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A third respondent warned that the video game market could become "oversaturated" with "low effort or AI created projects, content, and games that are put out to make money," comparing it to the mobile free-to-play market, currently dominated by fast-follow games that are constantly A/B testing to maximize placement in the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These attitudes run counter to other surveys about developer adoption of generative AI. Organizations like venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1869416258275533019">polled developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and reported that 73 percent of game studios using AI technology, and that about 67 percent of developers are "excited" about using AI in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's driving that gap in results? "A16z's methodology is opaque so it's hard to say for sure, but it's almost certainly a sampling issue," Omdia analyst Liam Deane explained to us. "If you ask developers to answer a survey about AI in games, the people who respond are inevitably going to be much more interested in AI than the average developer."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that the Game Developer Collective survey (run by Omdia in partnership with Game Developer) has found 35 percent of game developers are reporting the use of generative AI tools, a number that runs parallel to data from the State of the Industry survey. "These two surveys have very different methodologies, so the fact that they produce such similar results is a good sign that the data is pretty accurate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever you think of the data, what matters most at the end of the day is whether the rank-and-file are comfortable using generative AI tools to make fun, successful games. So far signs say they're not quite there yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The question is—will they ever be?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer, Omdia, and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/newegg-nintendo-eshop-gift-card-mentions-new-3d-mario-and-zelda-remake.1089066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newegg-nintendo-eshop-gift-card-mentions-new-3d-mario-and-zelda-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Newegg, a reputable online retailer for electronics, gaming peripherals, and even games themselves, has <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed the description</a> of their Nintendo eShop Gift Card. In the description, it now mentions games that haven't been announced yet, such as a "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster." At the moment, this information is still on their website and has caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>It is most likely just speculation on Newegg's side, as there have been hints at a new Mario Kart already, thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 first look trailer, with a lot of the information surrounding it being analyzed by Nintendo fans. There are also titles mentioned, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-2025-original-switch/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was first announced at E3 in 2017 and has now been confirmed by Nintendo to be released in 2025, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated trailer</a> released <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">seven months ago</a>. Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also set to release this year. It's uncertain whether these titles will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 or whether they'll also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As we said above, it is most likely that this description from Newegg is just speculation based on Nintendo's release patterns, as well as what the fans are hoping for. Nintendo fans have been wanting specific Zelda remakes for a long time, with a lot of the audience begging for a remake or remaster of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Many other Zelda games could also be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2, such as A Link to the Past or Phantom Hourglass. However, those seem less likely.</p>
<p>It's pretty much a given that Nintendo will come up with a new Mario game to release for the Nintendo Switch 2, as Mario is Nintendo's mascot, and they always find ways to create new games surrounding Mario and his troupe. Whether that comes in the form of a new Mario Kart game, a Mario Party game, or even a Mario Sports game, there are plenty of options laid on the table for Nintendo.</p>
<p>With such a description hinting at the release of Nintendo's games that haven't even been announced yet, there is a likelihood that they will be contacted and asked to amend the description in the event that they are on the right track. Nintendo is very protective of their IPs, and has no issue in sending a cease and desist to someone or a company, regardless of how small they are.</p>

His family loses it and an inane argument about the iconic film ensues, eventually leading Peter to utter the enigmatic and now memed-to-death line, “It insists upon itself.” Nearly two decades later, the show’s creator, Seth McFarlane, finally explains what it means. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Since this has been trending, here’s a fun fact: ‘It insists upon itself’ was a criticism my college film history professor used to explain why he didn’t think ‘The Sound of Music’ was a great film,” McFarlane <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X this week</a></span>. “First-rate teacher, but I never quite followed that one.” The joke isn’t that Peter is all of a sudden being an erudite critic as the family prepares to drown from his latest idiotic stunt. It’s just a funny-sounding bunch of words that sounds like it should mean something but actually doesn’t. </p><p><em>Family Guy </em>superfans have been trying to decipher a deeper meaning for years, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions perennially sprouting up</a></span> on forums, subreddits, and social media. Sometimes the phrase just starts trending as users riff while passing idle moments gazing at their phones. Even now, people still maintain that Peter was on to something and they know exactly what he meant. </p><p>“This is why I did not like Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>,” one person responded. “It slaps you in the face and shouts ‘This is an epic masterpiece! Appreciate it!’ I did not. He learned and toned it down a bit for the sequels.” What? </p><p>“My interpretation of ‘it insists upon itself’ is, when you’re watching it, you get the feeling that one of the intents behind the film was, ‘This is SUPPOSED to be good,’” wrote another. “There are many ways that you can try to be good without trying to be good, namely bucking trends. Insisting upon itself means it hit all the notes a ‘good’ movie “should.’”</p><p>The episode 77 gag ends with Peter revealing he hasn’t even finished <em>The Godfather</em> and prefers 1986's <em>The Money Pit </em>starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long instead. The punchline is that movie sucks, too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern will take over as co-studio heads of Insomniac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-wolverine-insomniac-mature-full-size">which is currently working on Marvel's Wolverine</a>, is currently "in one of the strongest positions" it's been in for years, Price said. "Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price said he made the decision last year because he felt "it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way" after more than 30 years leading Insomniac.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We’re going to keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schneider began at Insomniac during the PlayStation 2 era and later became the studio's first community director. He then joined the senior leadership team and served as head of franchise strategy and studio relations, and then head of brand and leadership strategy, before moving to co-studio head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Huang joined Insomniac as chief financial officer and head of finance eight years ago and has so far shipped 12 games with Insomniac. Finally, Dezern has been part of Insomniac since 1998 and has worked as an environment artist, art director, Durham studio director, and most recently as head of creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re going to keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them," the three said in a joint statement. "This aligns with our studio vision of making a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ted has also laid the foundation for Insomniac as one of the industry’s all-time most successful studio leaders. Now, it’s up to us to help Insomniac thrive long into the future. Thanks to Ted’s guidance and leadership, we are ready."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/gettyimages-644833678-1737564572665.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ted Price has retired from PlayStation after 30 years. Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Price alluded to this too. "There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights," he said. "Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He concluded: "I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life. Working side by side with Insomniacs for so many years has been a gift that I’ll cherish for the rest of my days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support — inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won’t be slowing down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac certainly appears to be plenty busy, though so far has only announced Wolverine. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">The studio was the victim of a data breach in 2023</a>, however, which revealed a long list of upcoming projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">In our 8/10 review of its latest release</a>, IGN said: "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, is a reliably fun superhero power trip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

There aren't any customizations to be had, but one feature it does include that seems likely to return when Blizzard introduces player housing proper is a way for players to set their Hearthstone to their new home.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time WoW players have received more personal living space. During the Warlords of Draenor expansion players had an entire Garrison to call their own, while Class Order Halls offered class-specific spaces for players of the same class to hang out in. This is, however, the first instance of players being able to acquire an apartment to call home.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a couple potential clues to how WoW might implement player housing to be gleaned here. For starters, the apartment simply exists in the game world, and players when visiting are treated to their own private "instance" of it. That seems to imply player housing won't be an entirely separate zone or a specific neighborhood where players can build custom houses, but rather the homes up for grabs will be added to existing locations in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's first player-owned apartment (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given how players are granted this apartment as a quest, it also seems likely that players will be given some form of player housing for free come Midnight, though there is certainly still room to have players be able to purchase other, more desirable properties. Players will ultimately have to wait for more information directly from Blizzard about what player housing will look like.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas in an interview with GameSpot last year said Blizzard was announcing player housing far in advance of Midnight's release in order to "begin a conversation" and "double-check" that Blizzard's plans for player housing matched the expectations of players. Announcing the feature so far ahead of the expansion itself also gives the team time to pivot if changes need to be made, he said. More information about player housing and Midnight it slated to come this summer, according to WoW's 2025 roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when players can unlock their apartment, the goblin-filled Undermine(d) update doesn't have a release date just yet, but is expected to release in the next month or two.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> creator Don't Nod is delaying the second half of its upcoming narrative adventure Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage by a month, with Tape 2 now set to release on 15th April.
</p>
<p>
Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage marks the first time since 2020's Twin Mirror that Don't Nod has revisited the narrative adventure genre that put it on the map, and it follows the story of four high-school friends across two timelines. One half recounts the group's hazily nostalgic "magical summer" of 1995, while the second timeline picks up 27 years later, when the friends reunite to "confront the long-buried secret that made them promise to never speak again."
</p>
<p>
It's a tale that'll also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">split across two releases</a>, with Tape 1 ("Bloom") launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 18th February. Part 2 ("Rage") was previously scheduled to launch a month later on 18th March, but Don't Nod has now announced it's pushing Tape 2's release back an additional four weeks, to 15th April.

<p>
In a statement detailing the delay, the studio said it had made the decision in order to "allow for additional optimisation and to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience for players and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey."
</p><p>
Both parts of Lost Records were originally due to launch last year, but Don't Nod announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-delays-new-game-to-avoid-new-lis-launch-date">shifting their release into 2025</a>, ostensibly to avoid <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert said at the time.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, both halves of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - which Don't Nod says should provide a total of around 10-12 hours playtime - will be available through a single purchase. The game's usual price is £35.89/39,99€/$39.99 USD, but the studio has also now confirmed a limited-time launch discount of 10 percent.

			<p>It's been announced today by Virtuos, a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading video game developer</a>, that they have strategically acquired three studios across the globe. Virtuos has helped co-develop games like Crash: Mind over Mutant, The Outer Worlds, Dead Island 2, and Hogwarts Legacy, for example. They have now announced that they have acquired Pipeworks (USA), Abstraction (Netherlands), and Umanaia (Canada). They have all worked on some very significant games, which will be detailed down below so you can get an idea of the kind of developers they are.</p>
<p>In the acquisition, they will each have their own role to play in the bigger picture, with Virtuos wanting to become a globalized powerhouse for "sustainable, flexible game development solutions." By acquiring these studios, it now allows Virtuos to offer a broader range of services across game development and live operations across the globe, with studios in Europe, Asia and North America. Thus far, Virtuos' has a network of studios across 26 locations worldwide, with their specializations being at the forefront of the big picture.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pipeworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pipeworks</a> will now be Virtuos' lead game development studio in North America, as they have a 25-year strong legacy, with experience working on titles such as Terraria and Call of Duty. The team is extensive, with nearly 200 employees working at the company to help co-develop titles for console, PC, and mobile. They currently have multiple AAA titles in development with studios such as Xbox Game Studios, PlayStation Studios, and Warner Bros. Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://abstraction.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstraction</a> has a significant co-development expertise, as their portfolio consists of major titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Dune: Awakening, with the company elevating Virtuo Labs' engineering capabilities. Their team consists of over 90 industry veterans, with their mission being focused on founding new technology and game prototypes to benefit and enhance the game development process.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.umanaia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umanaia</a>, who has a focus on original IPs and uses its experience in creating major titles such as Assassin's Creed and For Honor, and will be helping to bolster the ongoing process of creating Virtuos Originals. Their team is the newest, as it was founded in 2021. For the most part, they will be utilizing their expertise in Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) as well as their successful post-launch strategies. Alongside this, they will be refreshing beloved IPs and creating new experiences with the gamer in mind. Umanaia is also the smallest team, with over 40 senior developers, and will be working hard in the Virtuos Originals initiative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are looking to get a brand new Nvidia RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 at launch, it may be tougher than you expected. According to multiple rumors circulating, the release of the next-generation of graphics cards from Nvidia is gearing up to be the “worst when it comes to availability” in the company’s history.</p>



<p>One board partner, Zotac, confirmed supply issues in an <a href="https://tagtag.co.kr/article/notice/1/18681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message online</a>. The AIC says that their card won’t be available on January 30 as expected, instead it will be coming in early February. Still, Zotac says that “due to external factors” there’s the chance the card may not come until mid-February.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://benchlife.info/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-launch-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, they state that “communication issues” between Nvidia and its various AIC partners have resulted into limited supply for consumers.</p>



<p>Said gaming PC builder <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerGPU</a>, “Warning you all now. The launch of the RTX 5090 will be the worst when it comes to availability. Already being told to expect it to be that way for the first 3 months.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were revealed during CES</a> in early January. In addition to the two high-end graphics cards, Nvidia is set to release the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 sometime in February. An exact date, however, has yet to be announced by the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of the claims that launch availability for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 will be the worst in the company’s history? &nbsp;Let us know in down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games-armchair-generals-shouldn%E2%80%99t-miss.1089006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the ongoing Steam festival focusing on real-time strategy games, now’s the perfect opportunity to score a few titles you could potentially spend hundreds of hours playing. There’s a fair number of discounted RTS games I have personally spent up to 1,000 hours playing, and some are just too good of deals to pass up. Here’s a look at five highly recommended games on Steam’s Real-Time Strategy Fest!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-worth-buying-on-steam-s-rts-fest">Best Games Worth Buying on Steam’s RTS Fest</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of the strategy genre, you’re in luck because there are countless releases annually, many of which shine. Despite the new releases and innovative indie studios taking a chance at refreshing the genre, a few old standbys tend to keep most players’ attention. With the current Steam Fest, now’s a good time to jump in for yourself!</p>



<h3 id="h-hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you ever watched a documentary or read a history book about WW2 and thought, “I could do it differently?” If so, then <strong>Hearts of Iron IV</strong> is your game, as it allows you to take economic, political, and military command of an entire nation, prepare for the upcoming war by building weapons and cementing alliances, and then fight in a global conflict. It’s challenging, rewarding, and expansive!</p>



<h3 id="h-stellaris">Stellaris</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like Hearts of Iron IV, but in space, with more operatic moments and interesting setpieces. I mean, look at the screenshot above as a science vessel scans a planet with a red sun in the background. <strong>Stellaris </strong>is beautiful and one of the most straightforward Paradox titles for new players. It allows you to tell a grand story of a space-faring empire, which speaks to many!</p>



<h3 id="h-warno">Warno</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If taking command of an entire nation or galactic empire isn’t quite your speed, <strong>Warno</strong> offers a more grounded approach to real-time strategy by placing you in charge of a fighting force full of tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, helicopters, and even fighter jets. You’ll conquer territory on the map, fighting small-unit skirmishes and endure large-scale bombardments alike, for a bombastic and entertaining RTS experience!</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-billions">They Are Billions</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>They Are Billions</strong> proves to be a highly challenging yet rewarding strategy game that took me by surprise. I didn’t think I’d spend hundreds of hours trying to survive the zombie apocalypse in a city-building survival and real-time strategy game, but this one kept me playing. You are the last bastion of humanity, surviving seemingly endless waves of the undead as they attempt to wipe humanity from the planet.</p>



<h3 id="h-total-war-rome-2">Total War: Rome 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are certainly newer entries in the long-running Total War franchise, I will always retain a soft spot for <strong>Rome 2</strong> as one of my favorite historical strategy games in the series. It’s expansive, grand, and memorable, allowing players to restore the glory of Rome by conquering the Gauls to the north or moving into Greece to the east. The world is your oyster, so long as you have the coin and men to take it yourself!</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite strategy game everyone should check out? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the Insider Gaming forums</a> to talk strategy!</p>

<p>Prepare yourself, strategy gaming fans! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7 has gone gold ahead of release</a>, and it’s almost upon us!</p>

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Design and Build a Towering Ocean City</strong> – The world is dying, overtaken by the endless ocean. You are the leader of a small group of survivors stranded on a rusty boat. You find a small land area, solid enough to serve as a building foundation. And now, step by step, you build a city. This city will go up to the sky, weather many storms, and become a home for the last remnants of humanity. For your people.</li><li><strong>Master Physics-Based 3D Construction System</strong> – The game’s physics-based building mechanic challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions. While easy to grasp, this unique system introduces deeper simulation aspects and more creative freedom to the city-building sandbox, allowing you to bring numerous vertical city design ideas to life.</li><li><strong>Every Building Can Collapse</strong> – While building, you’re essentially playing Jenga with human lives at stake. Each structure can crumble, so you must provide enough support and find creative ways of using different building materials. There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it, though. For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or—save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other. If you fail, the state of the building can be reverted to before the collapse, so you can fix the mistakes and avoid tragic consequences – at least on lower difficulties!</li><li><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge a Bustling Colony of Survivors</strong> – Besides building and maintaining the city, you will also manage a colony of survivors. As their leader, navigate the wants and needs of several factions—Engineers, Sailors, and Workers—each with its own unique traits. For example, only Engineers can operate cranes, while Sailors have access to boat navigation, making resource gathering and logistics easier.</li><li><strong>Make Difficult Yet Necessary Decisions</strong> – Sometimes, you will have to make difficult yet necessary decisions to lead your people to prosperity. Try to feed every mouth generously, or be strict with food rationing. Establish martial law during the unrest, or show mercy and let people voice their frustrations. Go down in history as a benevolent shepherd or strong-hand tyrant—as long as the city prevails.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> New Challenges Every Time</strong> – Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events—like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more. Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,004 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Fans have often argued that human characters—like James Marsden’s small-town cop, Tom—have taken valuable screen time away from Sonic and his friends. The <em>Knuckles </em>show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-plus-show-episodes-idris-elba-1851423004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-plus-show-episodes-idris-elba-1851423004">barely even features the echidna</a></span>, mostly focusing on the (debatable) comic relief cop, Wade.

Absolutely,” O’Shaughnessey told <em>Screen Rant</em>.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“You could do something with just the characters in this world. But I feel like this last movie, they did such a great job of balancing the two, so if they continue on their pattern, my guess is they’ll continue to do that. I think it does lend something to it. It definitely takes it out of a video game, and really helps ground it into a more real world situation, if that makes sense. So, like I said, I feel like they really did a great job of balancing, and could they keep adding more and more characters? For sure, there’s definitely enough characters to go around. But I think they’ll keep it with both. But what do I know? They don’t tell me anything.</p></blockquote><p>Personally, I would be really bummed if the movies left behind the human characters entirely. A great strength of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> is that it put the non-animal focus primarily on the human characters fans have come to care for, specifically Sonic’s human parents Tom and Maddie, and the villainous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189">homoerotic duo Eggman and Agent Stone</a></span>.
