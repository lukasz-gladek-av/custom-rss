			<p>The rumored announcement of the God of War Ragnarok PC port is imminent, according to a reputable leaker.</p>
<p>On X, known deals leaker 'Billbil-kun' <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1795562998196560063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that Sony and Santa Monica Studio will be announcing the PC version of the God of War sequel "very soon". Unfortunately, the leaker can't specify an exact date just yet. Earlier this month, the leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that 2022's God of Ragnarok would be the next former PlayStation exclusive to be ported to PC. In addition, it was claimed that the announcement could very well be made this month.</p>
<p>Take this information with a pinch of salt for now, but 'Billbil-kun' has been spot on when it comes to leaking upcoming new PS Plus and Game Pass titles. In addition, the leaker has proven to be reliable when it comes to leaking unannounced titles as well - last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-is-the-series-next-installment-coming-to-pc-ps5-xsx-and-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leaker correctly leaked Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok was released for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 back in November of 2022. Last year, the game received the excellent free Valhalla expansion. Here's what we wrote about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion in our review last year</a>:</p>
<p><em>For a free expansion, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla offers quite a lot. The roguelite take on the base game's formula works extremely well, thanks to the excellent combat system, which truly shines in the extreme combat scenarios Kratos will have to conquer to confront his past and finally make a step towards the future. Its short length, which prevents the adventure from overstaying its welcome, and excellent accessibility with multiple difficulty settings that don't lock content behind them, also make the expansion one that all those who loved the base game should play.</em></p>
<p>Would you play God of War Ragnarok on PC or would you rather have Sony port another PlayStation title to PC first? Hit the comments below.</p>

<p>Following cost-cutting measures by Take-Two Interactive, the CEO of the firm, Strauss Zelnick, denied that Intercept Games – the developer behind Kerbal Space Program 2 – had closed down. However, he refused to comment on whether Take-Two Interactive <strong>would </strong>shut down Intercept Games – among other studios.  </p>



<p>Now, posts on social media have surfaced claiming that the team at Intercept Games will be made redundant as of June 28, 2024. Weeks ago, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791236904580436176/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg obtained documentation</a> showing that Take-Two was proposing the closure of the Roll7 studio – but these notes didn’t mention Intercept.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-go-again">‘Here We Go Again’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Intercept’s Quinn Duffy posted the following:</p>



<p><em>‘Well, here we go again.<p>The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I.</p><p>I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there. These are some fantastically smart and talented people and I’m happy to vouch for their qualities. And I can say the same about the other disciplines – good folks across the board.</p><p>Kerbal Space Program 2 is a delightful game, deeply engrossing, and incredibly pretty even in its early-access state and I hope you have a chance to check it out.’</p></em></p>



<p>In 2020, Take-Two Interactive opened Intercept Games in Seattle, Washington. The team was tasked with assuming the development of Kerbal Space Program 2, which has since been review-bombed on Steam following the news of the studio closure. It boasts a recent review rating of ‘Overwhelmingly Negative’ with most comments referring to the laying off of the team by Take-Two Interactive.</p>



<p>This is the latest in a long line of shutdowns in the industry that have led to almost 20,000 workers being made redundant since the start of 2023.</p>

<p>In an all-new financial report, CD Projekt revealed that development on Cyberpunk 2077 has officially ended. In the last report, published in February, there were just 17 developers left supporting the title – and now, that number has diminished completely. More than 400 developers are working on ‘Polaris’, the next game in The Witcher series, and 56 are occupied with Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-an-era">End of an Era</h2>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 to an overwhelmingly negative reception. It was such a failed game at launch that investors pursued legal action against CD Projekt Red. Then, amid a huge and ongoing expenditure, Cyberpunk 2077 was pulled out of the gutter by the team, and hundreds of millions of dollars turned it around for the better. By the time Phantom Liberty was released in 2023 (the game’s only expansion), Cyberpunk had come to be regarded as one of the most iconic rags-to-riches stories in gaming history.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2024/05/prezentacja-wynikowa-grupy-cd-projekt-q1-2024-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a> published by CDR confirmed that not a single developer is left working on Cyberpunk 2077. This is the first time in over a decade that nobody is supporting the game at CDPR. </p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 ended life on a high. It won a BAFTA Award for the ‘Best Evolving Game’ and secured a whopping 95% positivity rating on Steam, a remarkable number by all accounts – especially when little more than two years ago, the game boasted around a 50% positivity rating.</p>



<p>We can now look forward to what’s coming next from CD Projekt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/engineowning-activision-court-case/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last year, Activision Blizzard saw success in the courts, with EngineOwning – arguably the most prolific cheat provider in gaming – being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-cheaters-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered to pay</a> a whopping $3 million in damages. This case concerned both Overwatch and Call of Duty, but it wasn’t the end of the debacle as AB refused to relent. </p>



<p>Now, a judge has ruled that EngineOwning owes Activision Blizzard around $15 million in damages and legal fees, based on the platform’s constant (successful) attempts to circumvent AB’s anti-cheat systems. Not only that but the court also ruled that the EngineOwning domain must be surrendered to Activision Blizzard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crime-doesn-t-pay">Crime Doesn’t Pay</h2>



<p>In this lengthy fight between EngineOwning and Activision Blizzard, thousands of gamers were named and revealed as having used EngineOwning’s cheat software. This included a slew of content creators who were effectively besmirched by the lawsuit – and their malicious activities.</p>



<p>It was claimed in the final documentation from the court case that, in the United States, EngineOwning’s software was downloaded 72,328 times. The court therefore found it ‘reasonable’ that AB sought such a high sum in damages. It was later revealed that attorney fees alone amounted to $292,912. </p>



<p>For years, EngineOwning has provided cheat solutions for Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Battlefield, and Titanfall – amongst other games. The company also offered a hardware ID spoofer, which circumvents one of the core functions of anti-cheat software, particularly the high-end solutions that can enact ‘hardware bans’ against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this won’t do much to slow down these malicious operators, as the video game cheating market is like a multi-headed hydra – but it’s certainly a solid blow.</p>

			<p>Sony’s <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/28/get-ready-days-of-play-celebration-kicks-off-on-may-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Days of Play” celebration</a> kicks off tomorrow, and as part of that, they’re adding a bunch of new titles to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Plus</a>, including a number of “bonus” titles for Extra/Premium subscribers on top of the regular collection of games that will be added later on in June. First up, there are the standard monthly PS Plus Essential titles for June, which include SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever, and more. Here’s a rundown of the monthly Essential titles, which will be added on June 4.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus25.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>“Wish-granting Mermaid’s Tears in the hands of SpongeBob and Patrick… What could go wrong? Sure, the very fabric holding the universe together could come undone, opening portals into wild Wishworlds. But that’s nothing our favorite sponge can’t handle- with the right cosmic costume!”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Like the promotion it’s based on, AEW: Fight Forever can be a bit rough around the edges, but the game is also a welcome breath of fresh air. Fun, approachable in-ring action and an endearingly-quirky career mode largely make up for scruffy visuals and some missing content. AEW: Fight Forever won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking for an alternative, feel free to push your chips All In.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Streets of Rage 4 (</strong>PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Streets of Rage 4 doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but honestly, that’s okay. The game’s dazzling visuals, silky-smooth action, varied level design, and sexy sense of cool more than make up for a few minor old-school irritations. Veteran Bare Knuckle brawlers will get the most out of Streets of Rage 4, but it should provide a satisfying thumb workout for players from all eras.”</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are the “bonus” titles available to PS Plus Extra and Premium members…</p>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Extra</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dredge (PS4, PS5) May 29</em></li>
<li><em>Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 (PS4) May 31</em></li>
<li><em>Cricket 24 (PS4, PS5) June 5</em></li>
<li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition (PS4, PS5) June 7</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Premium Classics</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tomb Raider Legend (PS2) June 11</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars (PS2) June 11</em></li>
<li><em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus (PS2) June 11</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Premium PS VR2 Games</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord – June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Walkabout Mini Golf – June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Synth Riders – June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Before Your Eyes - June 6</em></li>
<li><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Chapters 1 &amp; 2 – June 6</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus – Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn’t changed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sim-4s-summer-of-love-continues-with-riviera-retreat-and-cozy-bistro-kit-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Sims 4, you might recall, is currently embarking on a sexy "summer of love" - which, so far, has mainly involved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">some new swimsuits</a>. Now, though, EA has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/cozy-bistro-and-riviera-retreat-kits">revealed</a> the next two items on its vaguely saucy list: the Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kit DLC, both arriving on 30th May.
</p>
<p>
First up, for those summery sunny days of relaxation and shameless undress, is the Riviera Retreat - a "secluded oasis" incorporating "stucco textures, beautiful archways, and shimmering waterfalls with comfortable linen furniture, wicker lounge chairs, and vine-covered pergolas."
</p>
<p>
This one's all about creating an "ambience of serenity and connection" for your Sims, says EA, whether reclining and rejuvenating alone or together with a smooching pal.

<p>
As for the Cozy Bistro Kit, expect a DLC of charming "old world" streets and "hole-in-the-wall" noshing ("hole-in-the-wall" apparently being a US term for an easily overlooked establishment in case you were wondering - which I definitely was).

<p>
"With welcoming awnings, classic furniture settings, and its inviting atmosphere," explains EA, "this beloved bistro is sure to become a neighbourhood favourite." It promises amenities that can be used in a bar or lounge lot, alongside building items including tall etched glass windows and doors, polished metal accents, bistro tables and chairs, plus vintage wall decor.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kits launch for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Steam, the EA App, and Epic Games Store) this Thursday 30th May, where they'll likely cost £4.99/$4.99 apiece. EA says it's also adding two new builds utilising each pack - the The Cozy Bistro and Riviera Retreat Poolhouse - to The Sims 4's in-game gallery on the same day.

                <p>RPG fans who haven't picked up Star Ocean: The Second Story R are in luck. The beautiful reimagining of the classic 1998 role-playing game is on sale for an awesome price. The remake gives the beloved entry in the series a modern touch; it's an adventure that deftly bridges the gap between past and future. The Second Story R has only received a couple discounts since launching last holiday, and the current $35 price matches the all-time low--which sold out quickly at this price last time. This deal is available for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PS4 versions of the game at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r---nintendo-switch%2F20006770-6c0948f1.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r-discounted-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6522045%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.</p><p>Similar to the Octopath Traveler games, Star Ocean: The Second Story R was entirely remade to be both faithful to the source material while incorporating modern elements into its design. The game makes use of 2D pixel art character sprites and places them in retro-styled 3D environments, with the final result being looking like a 4K PlayStation One game. It's a mesmerizing effect that <em>shouldn't </em>work this well but has to be seen in action.</p><p>The game also features both English and Japanese voice acting, a newly arranged soundtrack, and a high degree of replayability. Alongside several tweaks and quality-of-life changes, it strikes an ideal balance between staying faithful to the original game and giving it a welcome update for the current era.</p><p>"Star Ocean: The Second Story R is a remake that manages to not only have the retro feel of its older PS1 and PSP incarnations, but also make it feel fresh with new battle mechanics, as well as audio and visuals updates. It may not be the big break that’ll finally make the Star Ocean franchise explode in popularity, but it’s a fine Japanese RPG on its own terms," George Yang wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-review-back-to-the-future/1900-6418147/" data-ref-id="1900-6418147">Star Ocean: The Second Story R review</a>.</p><p>Star Ocean: The Second Story R isn't the only Square Enix game on sale for an all-time best price.

All of the materials included in the bundle are compatible with Fantasy Grounds Unity.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't want the full bundle, there are smaller options available that cost less. The $10 bundle includes the digital Pathfinder 2E beginner box, two adventure modules, and three maps. The $20 tier adds 11 more books and maps, including the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook. Both of these cheaper options also include the Fantasy Ground Unity Ultimate three-month trial (the standard license is only included in the $30 bundle).</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fsoftware%2Fpathfinders-finest-2e-fantasy-grounds-experience-software&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fadd-pathfinder-and-talisman-to-your-virtual-tabletop-library-with-these-humble-bundle-deals%2F1100-6523766%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pathfinder's Finest 2E Fantasy Grounds Experience Bundle</a> is available until June 17.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4309343-talismandigital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309343" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4309343-talismandigital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309343"></a><figcaption>Talisman: Digital Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4309343-talismandigital.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Humble's other digital tabletop bundle is for the Steam versions of the popular board game Talisman.

                <p>Official Xbox Wireless Controllers are awesome as is, but if you want a little more versatility without breaking the bank, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGJ6FB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Horizon Vista Strikepack from Collective Minds</a> is a quick and easy way to enhance your device. The detachable gadget is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGJ6FB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to preorder for $50 at Amazon</a> ahead of its June 3 release.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309085"></a><figcaption>Collective Minds Strikepack - Horizon Vista M.O.D.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg"></figure><p>This is revitalized and updated version of previous Strikepacks, and the layout for the Horizon Vista model remains the same. What you're getting here is four programmable back buttons that can be bolted onto your controller through the battery pack, creating a fairly seamless appearance. You can still connect a USB-C cable for wired gaming and charging and a dedicated app allows you to tinker with each button to a high degree. Using the dedicated mobile app, you can set your own combos and do some more fine-tuning, making this a pretty versatile device.</p><p>The Strikepack is pretty cool since it allows you to keep using your existing Xbox controllers, but it's far from the only customizable controller option out there. Our top pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>, Microsoft's premium wireless controller that offers awesome customization features and swappable components.

It has swappabl sticks (offset and aligned layouts), comes with a fight pad module with six microswitch buttons, an interchangeable D-pad, stick caps, and stick gates. On top of that, a smartphone app allows for even more fine-tuning under the plastic hood.</p><p>On the budget side of customizable controllers, 8BitDo has released a couple of solid options: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Xbox-One-Joysticks-Officially/dp/B0CWLGNCBD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Wired-Controller-Xbox-Windows-x/dp/B07P5K93ZN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pro 2</a>, both of which retail for $45. There's also an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1VHH4C5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">upcoming 8BitDo controller for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One</a>, although this one comes with a few caveats on console and is perhaps even better suited for PC gamers. While this controller features the high build quality and flexibility of other 8BitDo Ultimate devices, you can only use it in wired mode with the included detachable USB-C cable on Xbox consoles. PC users can sync the controller using 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth, sidestepping those console shortcomings.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Your teacher once told you that you couldn't carry a calculator everywhere with you, but they were wrong! Because if they ever cast their eyes on this stylish new 8BitDo numpad/calculator hybrid, they'd have special pockets sewn into their clothes to keep it with them at all times. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QC8R4P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad</a></strong> is a retro-themed piece of tech that you can either use as an extension to one of the company's matching TKL mechanical keyboards, or as a stylish piece of number-crunching equipment for when you need to do some quick math. Remember, life comes at you hard, but numbers hit you even harder.</p><p>Inspired by classic hardware, the Numpad features hot-swappable PCB keys, a retro LED display, and can be connected via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz dongle. 8BitDo says it's compatible with Windows and Android devices, and it comes in several different editions. Depending on your personal taste, you can pick one up for $45 in NES, Famicom, Commodore 64, or IBM Model M-inspired designs when it launches on July 15. It's worth noting that the 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard is also marketed for Windows and Android, but it works great with Mac, Steam Deck, and other devices, too. We'd expect the Retro 18 Numpad to be the same way.</p><h3>8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QC8R4P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad (N model)</a> -- $45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad (C64 model)</a> -- $45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QPC1GG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro Numpad (M model)</a> -- $45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QGX9QB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad (Fami model)</a> -- $45</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309277-8bitdo-numpad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309277-8bitdo-numpad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309277"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309277-8bitdo-numpad.jpg"></figure><p>Even if you're not planning to add an extension to your keyboard, a dedicated calculator is always welcome around the house. Yes, your smartphone can tell you in depressing detail how much your taxes are going to be for the year, but there's a reassuring feeling of comfort to have a calculator on hand to punch out some numbers.

            <p>

Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games will lay off its employees at the end of June according to a senior team manager, despite Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick insisting earlier this month that the studio hadn't been shut down.
</p>
<p>
Word of Intercept Games' impending demise - and the loss 70 jobs at the studio - came earlier this month via a decidedly official <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">Washington state closure notice</a> submitted by Take-Two itself, and was corroborated by affected employees on social media. Later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier - after viewing an internal Take-Two Interactive email to staff - <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios">reported</a> OlliOlli World developer Roll7 was also being closed down.

That didn't stop Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick from later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-claims-publisher-hasnt-shut-down-olliolli-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">repeatedly insisting</a>, "We didn't shutter those studios." But whatever semantic technicality Zelnick was invoking at the time, it isn't one likely to impress employees at Intercept Games.

Kerbal Space Program 2 senior design manager Quinn Duffy has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quinn-duffy_well-here-we-go-again-the-team-at-intercept-activity-7201280703215394816-uyzd?trk=public_profile">posted to LinkedIn</a> saying the Intercept team will be laid off as of 28th June. "I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there," he continued. "These are some fantastically smart and talented people and I'm happy to vouch for their qualities. And I can say the same about the other disciplines - good folks across the board."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two - perhaps unsurprisingly given its refusal to acknowledge Intercept's closure - hasn't yet commented on Kerbal Space Program 2's future. However, thousands of early access purchasers have vented their frustration as the publisher's silence continues, pushing the £44.99 game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/954850/Kerbal_Space_Program_2/">recent Steam rating</a> down to Overwhelmingly Negative in light of Intercept's reported closure.
</p>
<p>
In April, Take-Two announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">laying off five percent of its 11,000-strong workforce</a> - equating to around 550 people - and cancelling multiple in-development projects, despite Zelnick saying the company had "no current plans" to lay off staff just weeks before.

In <a href="https://halloflegends.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>, the studio explains that it worked with the eSports legend to create an event pass celebrating his legacy. Festivities include three new Ahri Collections with prices that are turning heads.</p><p>Each bundle is more expensive than the last, beginning with the Risen Legend Collection at 5430 RP or around $40. It includes the Hall of Legends Pass, a Takedown Counter Taunt, an icon, an emote, a banner, and Ahri with a unique, orange and white skin. Next up is the substantially more expensive Immortalized Legend Collection, which costs 32430 RP or around $250, and packs in the Risen Collection along with a selection of exclusive skin transformations, finishers, the Immortalized Ahri skin, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>League of Legends Risen, Immortalized, and Signature Collections</h3></div></output><p>Finally, at 59260 RP, or around $450, there’s the Signature Immortalized Legend Collection that includes the Immortalized Collection as well as a “Final Boss Faker” title, a Faker-themed signature move and structure finisher, an exclusive border, banner, 100 pass levels, and more. It’s a lot of content with a uniquely high price tag, so it was no surprise to see players commenting on the pricing upon its reveal.</p><p>“It's crazy that Faker, known for his generosity and taking less salary over the years so he could stay in Korea, is going to be associated with these crazy packages where the base skin isn't able to transform,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1d2luzd/comment/l61bhcn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “I looked at the 2 whales packages and pretty much expected like a physical Ahri statue to be included in them, but they were just a couple of finishers and signature emotes. Absolute bonkers.”</p><p>“The way I thought 59k rp was a typo lmfaooo,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1d2luzd/comment/l61e9cv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i think for this price i better be coached by faker himself <a href="https://t.co/ym0kHvpQNj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/ym0kHvpQNj</a> <a href="https://t.co/QqzPajfsm2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QqzPajfsm2</a></p>— swifts (@swiftsporo) <a href="https://twitter.com/swiftsporo/status/1795482334457921945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder that Faker doesn't use skins and Riot just made the Faker Ahri skin cost $500</p>— ioki (@i0ki_LoL) <a href="https://twitter.com/i0ki_LoL/status/1795482068060877267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Riot provided a statement regarding how it chose pricing information for the new bundles in an FAQ on its website:</p><blockquote>Whether you're a new fan, a long-term diehard, or just want to join the celebration, we thought it essential for there to be something for you—and for everyone—as we celebrate our first Hall of Legends inductee.</blockquote><blockquote>For the more casual fan, we have some of our most generous bundles to date. The Hall of Legends Pass includes multiple skins (including Risen Legend LeBlanc), emotes, and more, while the Risen Legend Collection adds the new Risen Legend Ahri skin for collectors to enjoy. For those looking to flex their fandom, the Immortalized Legend Collection and Signature Immortalized Legend Collection include spectacular additions, headlined by the evolving Immortalized Legend Ahri skin. While more expensive, these versions are meant to be highly commemorative, with never-before-implemented features that we can’t wait to see hit the Rift.</blockquote><p>The Collections arrive as part of the League of Legends Hall of Legends event. It runs from June 12 to July 8, and it's unclear if the Collections will be made available again in the future. Additional Hall of Legends events are planned to commorate other star players in the community annually.</p><p>For more on League of Legends, you can read about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-assures-players-that-new-league-of-legends-anti-cheat-software-is-not-bricking-pcs">anti-cheat software that Riot assures is not bricking PCs</a>.

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Today, <em>Yakuza </em>— or rather, <em>Like a Dragon</em> — is pretty well known far and wide as a series of exciting, corny, and hammed-up RPGs by Sega. But history could have been much different. Back when the series was originally pitched, Sega “flat-out rejected” it.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">In <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-creator-talks-about-sega-flat-out-rejecting-the-first-yakuza-game-thinking-it-wouldnt-sell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a> (via Automaton) with <em>Like a Dragon</em> series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi, the former series head recalled the time Sega smacked the idea off the table like a curmudgeonly cat. According to Nagoshi, Sega was desperately seeking new video game ideas with worldwide appeal. </p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">“This led to a mindset of making games that would appeal to the masses, games that could sell anywhere and to anyone. Many producers, including myself, thought this way,” Nagoshi said.</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">For anyone who has played a <em>Like a Dragon</em> game, or even looked at a set of screenshots, can tell you that the saga of Kiryu Kazuma and friends ain’t that. (Even if it should be.)</p> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>What’s the problem? | Image via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-came-to-be-during-a-tumultuous-time-for-sega" data-injectable="false"><em>Like a Dragon</em> came to be during a tumultuous time for Sega</h2> <p data-characters="584" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Sega initially said no, and it’s no surprise why. <em>Like a Dragon</em>, directly translated from its Japanese name of <em>Ryu Ga Gotoku</em>, wasn’t strictly designed for Western audiences. The game took place in a small part of Tokyo, rich with attractions and references that only those fluent in Japanese culture may understand or recognize. It starred a former member of a Japanese crime syndicate who chewed corny tough-guy lines while balancing his time with a conspiracy story, taking care of a puppy, playing pachinko, and getting toilet paper for a man stuck in a park bathroom. </p>
 <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">The series was, and still is, an eclectic blend of silliness and drama, but Sega didn’t see the potential right away. </p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">“Of course, it was flat-out rejected,” Nagoshi explained. “After all, it was completely contrary to what I mentioned earlier about attracting the masses. Children wouldn’t be able to play it, and it wasn’t catered to women nor overseas audiences. In this sense, there was no way for it to be approved without resistance.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Nagoshi was persistent and, eventually, Sega relented. He said he was “quite forceful” in looking for approval. With Nagoshi always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI7BUZ4rgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dressing like</a> he crawled out of a <em>Like a Dragon</em> game himself, I guess I’m not shocked that Sega ultimately saw things his way.</p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">It’s not like Sega was wrong from a business perspective, mind. Back in the early ’00s when <em>LAD </em>was being pitched, Sega had already likely given up the Dreamcast and was reeling over <em>Shenmue</em>‘s disappointing sales figures. The latter was known as the most expensive game ever made — a title it held for many years. The absurd <em>Like a Dragon</em> must have been viewed as an exceptionally tough sell for outside Japan. </p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">But Sega definitely tried. The publisher went so far as to fully dub the original game in English, while bringing in Mark Hamill to voice Goro Majima, a role he may <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/10mb4kz/in_spite_of_video_evidence_and_popular_belief/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not even remember taking</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Sega</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true"><em>Yakuza</em>, as it was called when it finally came to the West, also didn’t reach mainstream appeal for many years. The fourth mainline game in the series was nearly the last to cross the seas, as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yakuza-5-is-finally-coming-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Yakuza 5</em> localization almost didn’t happen</a>. Regardless, with <em>Yakuza 0</em> and <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, the series is now firmly nestled into the zeitgeist on both the East and West. Nagoshi, however, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yakuza-creator-toshihiro-nagoshi-forms-nagoshi-studio-japan-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has moved on</a> and is making games for his new studio.</p>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="false">Fast-forward a couple decades and the latest game in the franchise is a smash hit for Sega. <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-clears-one-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soared to 1 million sold</a> within a week of its launch, outpacing the sales of its predecessors (and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we loved it</a>). The series, along with <em>Persona</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, contributed to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/segas-full-year-sales-jump-20-as-persona-and-like-a-dragon-sales-surge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20% sales increase</a>, Sega announced this month. Let’s be collectively glad the company eventually said yes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166460/youtube-playables-games-play-launch-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KVqinE">YouTube launched a new feature on Tuesday: free mobile games you can play right in the app or on your desktop. After several months of testing the feature with YouTube Premium subscribers, the sub-100-game platform hybrid is now out for all users, and it’s, unsurprisingly, disappointing. </p>
<p id="O3yPx1">In order to comply with Apple’s App Store regulations, the YouTube app <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business">can’t directly compete with the App Store</a> itself — that is, it can’t sell apps or games. So Google’s YouTube is offering free games within the app itself instead, and the throttled experience does little to inspire competition with even the free games on the App Store. Rather than downloading the games you want to play, Playables essentially functions like any other website that hosts games. (If you can’t think of one, it’s probably because most games live on our hard drives or in the cloud these days — but <a href="http://addictinggames.com/">AddictingGames.com</a> is an approximation that comes to mind.)</p>
<p id="ckfsCC">That means some well-produced games, like <em>Tomb of the Mask</em>, can do things like save your progress. Others restart each time you open the game on Playables. Some include controls designed for keyboard inputs, and others make you toggle between the trackpad and the mouse. </p>
<p id="v3ugsY">Besides a few highlights like <em>Tomb of the Mask</em>, <em>Angry Birds Showdown</em>, and <em>Cut the Rope</em>, there are tens of extremely cheap games that aren’t very enjoyable to play on the desktop. (<em>Draw Climber</em>, <em>Lunch Box Ready</em>, and <em>Color Match</em> are a few examples of the, uh, <em>less polished</em> options on Playables.) They’re also a bummer to play on the mobile app since the interface cuts off about one-tenth of the screen and has no full-screen mode. The browser version’s full-screen mode simply enlarges the browser to fill the screen, rather than just the game, as if it were a YouTube video.</p>

<p id="j0m3O2">I can’t knock YouTube for finding a way to make some of these games easily and legally playable (ha) on a browser sans ads — crushing a few levels of any given web-based game between meetings brings me right back to the computer room in the mid-2000s, in a good way — but with the advent of Steam, this move feels more like Google signaling to Apple that it’s still here to compete in the digital games marketplace space, rather than a move to benefit players. I might find myself playing some <em>Tomb of the Mask</em> on YouTube’s web browser, but I’m certainly not going to play it on YouTube’s mobile app considering it’s free on the App Store. So, to keep my progress in one place, I’ll just continue playing on my iPhone.</p>
<p id="4bkE6b">In terms of the interface, there’s a lot of room for improvement. Currently, you can only filter your Playables games by “Home,” which shows games you’ve played, and “Browse,” which shows all the games available in alphabetical order. You can also search in your YouTube search bar for a game, but you’ll have to wade through a few rows of videos and ads before you get to the Playables module.</p>
<p id="cGzA3u">That, along with the poor selection of titles, speak to one of the main reasons the Google Play Store hasn’t won out over Apple’s App Store: curation. I have access to both marketplaces, and consistently I find Google’s marketplace to be bloated with crappy games that are predominantly there to get eyes on the advertisements hosted within the games. </p>
<p id="IGX0mm">The App Store has this problem, too, but Apple is notoriously incisive about which apps are allowed on the store, particularly in terms of privacy and data collection. That means games with higher production value, aka teams with more cash and time to go through the Apple vetting process, might be more likely to land on both marketplaces while low-budget, quick-hit games might only land on the Play Store.</p>
<p id="F8005l">I expect Playables to become much more populated in the coming months, meaning a lot of these early complaints could subside. I’m especially curious to see whether YouTube releases any original games, which would make a much more compelling case for me to sink more time into the platform. And while I think this Playables a smart and sneaky way to get folks playing Google Play Store games on iPhones, I don’t think it’s going to nudge the industry one way or the other — at least not in its current state. </p>

<p data-characters="439" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Back in April, Take-Two announced that it would be laying off <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 5% of its workforce</a> as part of a cost-cutting initiative. There’s been a lot of confusion around the announcement, with some reports saying that studios like Roll7 and Intercept are being shuttered, and Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick denying it. Either way, today game director Quinn Duffy has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said via Linkedin</a> that the team at Intercept are out of a job as of June 28.</p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">It’s pretty frustrating. When previously asked directly about the status of Roll7 (developer of the acclaimed <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-olliolli-world-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OlliOlli World</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/rollerdrome-review-destructoid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollerdrome</a></em>) and Intercept Games (<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kerbal-space-program-2-launches-into-early-access-in-rough-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kerbal Space Program 2</a></em>) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview with IGN</a>, Zelnick stated, “We didn’t shutter those studios, to be clear.”</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Despite the choice of words, this seems hardly clear. Internal reports claimed to contradict this statement. But when IGN pressed for, erm, clarity, Zelnick said, “We did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what [the restructuring] looks like.”</p>
 <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="141" data-injectable="false">I suppose it’s technically accurate that no public statement had been made, but I’d find it pretty embarrassing to split hairs over this.</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkedin post</a> today, Intercept’s game director Quinn Duffy said, “The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I.”</p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="817" data-injectable="true">To echo what <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/take-two-denies-shutting-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-but-wont-say-if-they-still-exist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my colleague Michael Beckwith wrote</a>, I don’t see what the point of the denial is. Even a “no comment” would be more appropriate. Instead, this is like a parent telling a child they didn’t buy them a Game Boy for their birthday to keep it a surprise, but in this instance, it’s a studio being laid off. It just feels like a really insulting misdirection. Corporate executives really don’t seem to have much respect for their employees.</p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">Few announcements have been made regarding the development of <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, which is currently in Early Access. Take-Two confirmed to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-confirms-kerbal-space-program-2-is-safe-despite-seattle-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> that it will continue to make updates to <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, but to what extent those updates will go is unclear.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="false">The closure of Roll7 has likewise not been officially confirmed, but considering the internal note originated from that company, it feels all but certain. It’s a frustrating situation for a number of developers who are now being forced out into a competitive, struggling job market, with their previous work and livelihoods still taught on strings for show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24166456/disney-star-wars-hotel-video-galactic-starcruiser-jenny-nicholson-bad-app<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="p88P58">Earlier in May, filmmaker and critic Jenny Nicholson released the four-hour YouTube documentary <a href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4"><em>The Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel</em></a>. The video has since commanded nearly 6 million views, and spawned dozens of follow-up thinkpieces, ranging from fervent hand-wringing over the diminished nature of the modern theme park experience, to critics arguing against the continued commercial viability of the Star Wars brand itself, to genuine surprise at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html">consumer appetite for long-form video content on YouTube</a>. I personally don’t have a lot to add to the discourse, other than this: Nicholson is right about the app. There was no hope for the hotel with that app. </p>
<p id="E226Q6">I was there, Gandalf, during an abbreviated tour of Galactic Starcruiser hosted by Disney Parks in February 2022. As I made clear in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22949892/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-review-price-hotel-video">my review of the Star Wars hotel</a>, Polygon was invited to the four-hour event on Disney’s dime. In fact, you can see footage from the very same tour that I was on around the two-hour mark in Nicholson’s video.</p>
<div id="cYJyiY"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T0CpOYZZZW4?rel=0&amp;start=7390" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SKgupL">At no time during that junket were the many influencers or the handful of press present on board the Galactic Starcruiser, known as the Halcyon, given access to the Datapad app. Instead, the junket was verbally annotated by Disney’s tour guides as though we had been using the app all along. Cast members directed us to certain in-fiction events and performances as though we had been welcomed into those spaces by the app. But Nicholson’s investigation, based on her own firsthand account of the full experience as well as anecdotal reports posted on social media by dozens of other guests, paint a damning picture of a piece of software that simply didn’t work as intended. </p>
<p id="xQiIm4">The Galactic Starcruiser Datapad, itself baked into the larger My Disney Experience app, was supposed to be the conduit that connected guests to the storyline of their choice during their stay at the Star Wars hotel. In practice, however, it’s clear that the app only worked some of the time. As a result, a significant portion of the guests that attended the (at minimum) roughly $5,000 two-day experience were set adrift, left untethered from whatever levers were available to the staff on site to properly involve them in the goings-on aboard the starship. The only solution for some guests was to step outside the fiction, pick up the phone or get in line with a customer service representative at the hotel, and complain the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p id="yxdUqC">What killed Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser? I don’t think it was the presence of Rey and Kylo Ren or any of the other trappings of the modern-day trilogy. And I don’t think it was the dearth of engaging things to do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/31/20836704/disney-world-star-wars-land-galaxys-edge-orlando-guide">at the Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge theme park</a> either, although that probably didn’t help matters much. What ultimately torpedoed the Star Wars hotel was bad app design, a buggy piece of software that was never quite up to the task.</p>
<p id="gmOx1P">Sadly, the Star Wars hotel is no more. The Halcyon took guests on a final voyage <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23729103/disney-world-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-shut-down-september-2023">last year in September</a>. It’s a shame, because some of the performances — especially those involving Rey and her allies in the Resistance — were extraordinary. There’s clearly only so much heavy lifting that a dedicated team of actors can do when the digital director driving the action fails as spectacularly as the Datapad app did here.</p>

<section><p>There's plenty of time for the season to change shape, but out of the gate, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 feels like an all-timer.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> kicked off its 30th season in the game's unique history. It became a pop-culture titan almost immediately after it debuted in 2017 and has not only enjoyed a level of sustained success that few other games have ever achieved, it's also turned many other live-service games into followers that must react to the waves Epic's game creates. Fortnite has blazed trails and reinvented itself more times than I can easily recall, and yet it's the latest season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-chapter-5-season-3-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5422/">Chapter 5 Season 3</a>, that might be the game's best effort yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Subtitled Wrecked, this season of Fortnite reinvents the game to an extent Epic has arguably never gone before. Despite seasons debuting roughly four times a year and the introduction of new islands now being an annual event, Wrecked feels like the biggest and boldest change in how the game plays since Chapter 2 Season 3, which saw the entire island be submerged under flood waters that took weeks to recede. Once they did, cars were newly introduced, too, which further altered the future of Fortnite in major ways. Funnily enough, it's this season's focus on vehicles that's resulted in such an immediately exciting and fresh experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 3 Wrecked Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This season is, to put it bluntly, Twisted Metal. With its punk rock- and dieselpunk-inspired setting befitting of Mad Max, the huge sand dunes and high-velocity stunt ramps make each round the most chaotic experience I've seen in my thousands of hours playing Fortnite. Early portions of a round tend to involve players not just loading up on guns and healing items. Now, they also quickly seek out a ride before attaching various mods onto their weapons of gassed destruction.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can attach things like machine guns, grenade launchers, spiked bumpers, and more onto any car in the game, and they can easily swap one mod for another that occupies the same slot by simply driving over the mod crates like a classic arcade car combat game. It feels old-school cool but with all the high-end visual flare and tight PvP mechanics Epic's mesmerizing Unreal Engine 5 allows. According to credible leaks, future updates will bring even more car mods, such as spiked tire rims and bulletproof windows.</p><p dir="ltr">There are even boss vehicles on the map right now that, if claimed from the baddies, put their drivers and their teams in the figurative pole position to make it to the final few contenders. With gas reserves now much easier to manage, players aren't just making sweet post-apocalyptic rides; they're staying in them for much or even most of a round, with final storm circles now unfolding like destruction derbies. Every season has an item or two that the community leans into and really loves, but never have I seen the composition of rounds and final circles change so drastically--and for the better. Players are suddenly treating their customized cars like a companion horse in an open-world RPG--tending to their well-being and constantly being aware of their whereabouts.</p><p dir="ltr">In one awesome moment this past weekend, while I battled it out in duos mode, I jumped into the passenger seat of my enemies' ride, and then used their machine gun to take down the driver's ally. I've had other rounds where I've had to dodge cars like a bullfighter, carefully dotting them with the new explosive crossbow bolts between evasive maneuvers. And the game's Hulk Hands-like Nitro Fists allow players on foot to pack a punch that can adequately counter a charging supercar like a scene out of a Marvel movie. Each round even opens with many players descending into the Nitro Dome for a <em>literal </em>destruction derby that might feature a tenth or more of the entire lobby's competitors boosting off ramps and smashing each other into giant pits of metal grinders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4309346-still001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309346" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4309346-still001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309346"></a><figcaption>This season has players considering their car builds as much as their own inventory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4309346-still001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I find this latest makeover especially commendable considering just how many times Fortnite has reinvented itself already; this season takes Epic's edict of constantly reinventing the game to a new level. This feels bigger than the debut of Spider-Man Web Shooters, bigger than when Mythic weapons were introduced, and even bigger than the flood. It's such a drastic change that it's simply fascinating to watch this experiment unfold in the games industry. It tells me that Fortnite can be whatever Epic wants it to be, provided the mechanics are there to support it. But more than a live-service experiment, it's also just extremely fun to play. Cars have long been a joy in Fortnite, and this season emphasizes them like no other by basically giving everyone their very own Batmobile. Ultimately, it's this change, which almost seems simple after years of cars in Fortnite, that has transformed the game like never before in its 30th season.</p><p dir="ltr">A Fortnite season is ultimately judged not just for its launch suite of new toys, but also for its many smaller changes over the course of a few months. New weapons, abilities, and other unpredictable debuts will spill out between now and August, so I suppose this season could level-out and be remembered as merely another fun one. But given just how different, chaotic, and enjoyable it's already been in its first few days, Chapter 5 Season 3 already feels like the best season of Fortnite to date.</p>

<p data-characters="215" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere is arguably the most ambitious interconnected fantasy universe out there, and since these books have been decades in the making, it’s not surprising to find that they vary in quality.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Indeed, books like <em>The Way of Kings </em>and <em>The Final Empire </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-fantasy-books-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are separated</a> by more than just a star system within this fictional world. Sanderson’s writing has undergone massive shifts over the years, usually for the better, and his storytelling chops get more and more intricate as we move forward in what can only be called epic fantasy’s equivalent of the MCU.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="797" data-injectable="true">Note that this isn’t a Cosmere reading order recommendation, nor an absolutely objective ranking of Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere novels — if that would even be possible. This is an overview of Sanderson’s two-decade career, highlighting how the aspiring fantasy author has evolved into <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fantasy-book-series-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a maestro of the genre</a> and what those developments have entailed. Here follows every major release in the Cosmere, ranked from worst to best.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>21. <em>Elantris</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="624" data-current-count="924" data-injectable="true"><em>Elantris </em>was the first-published Brandon Sanderson novel. Taking place in the titular city of Elantris, this debut book revolves around an ensemble of humans turned into demigods, with the ability to live forever and heal whatever ill afflicts normal people. But disaster strikes when an unknown curse befalls Elantris and turns its populace into a host of the undead, unable to die and always in pain. <em>Elantris </em>is very inventive in terms of worldbuilding, but Sanderson’s prose is very rough. To this day, I think Sanderson’s first novel remains his worst, and should in no way be considered a gateway into his Cosmere.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>20. <em>Dawnshard</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><em>Dawnshard </em>is a <em>Stormlight Archive </em>spinoff centering around Rysn. It takes place after <em>Oathbringer </em>(the third <em>Stormlight </em>book) and as such should be read after that book. Fan-favorite characters like Lopen and Navani Kholin appear in this novella, but I personally never found the Rysn interludes in the main <em>Stormlight Archive </em>all that compelling, and certainly not enough to warrant a novella of her own.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Dynamite Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>19. <em>White Sand</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><em>White Sand </em>is a series of graphic novels taking place in the desert world of Taldain. It features a unique magic system that involves sand, with the story following a Sand Master named Kenton. The <em>White Sand </em>world can serve as a great palate cleanser, especially after reading Sanderson’s chunkier novels like <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> that easily go above 1000 pages.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>18. <em>Edgedancer</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">Now if there ever was a character needing a novella of her own, it would be Lift. The odd Reshi who consumes food and turns it into Investiture to slide her way to mischief is one of the best comic relief heroes in the entire Cosmere. <em>Edgedancer </em>takes place after <em>Words of Radiance </em>(the second <em>Stormlight </em>book) and features Lift as the main character. It’s certainly not among Sanderson’s best works, but who cares about that when you’ve got Lift running, or rather, sliding loose in a story of her own?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>17. <em>Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"><em>Arcanum Unbounded </em>is a must-have for Cosmere stans because it includes a host of shorts and novellas detailing what happens in the backdrop of some of these main stories. The Eleventh Metal and Secret History are both part of this anthology book, and they give readers more insight into what went down behind the scenes in the original <em>Mistborn </em>trilogy.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>16. <em>The Alloy of Law </em>(Wax &amp; Wayne #1)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="831" data-injectable="true">Taking place many years after the first trilogy, <em>The Alloy of Law </em>thrusts readers into the second <em>Mistborn </em>era, this time in a steampunk setting, and introduces them to Wax and Wayne. Given how brilliantly <em>The Final Empire </em>sets up the <em>Mistborn </em>world, a lot of readers were partially underwhelmed by how <em>The Alloy of Law </em>picked up the narrative. But then again, you can’t always expect Sanderson to write acclaimed page-turners. After all, even the Brando Sando machine is prone to churning out mediocre books every now and again.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Dragonsteel Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>15. <em>The Sunlit Man</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="814" data-injectable="true">The fourth Secret Project from Sanderson’s most-backed Kickstarter campaign of all time, <em>The Sunlit Man </em>takes place in the space age of the Cosmere, more than ten-thousand years following the Shattering of Adonalsium. It follows the story of a person named Nomad, who has gained immortality and is escaping a mercenary band called the Night Brigade by hopping between Cosmere worlds. But there’s more to this Nomad person than meets the eye, and learning his true identity will leave you utterly flabbergasted.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>14. <em>Shadows of Self </em>(Wax &amp; Wayne #2)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true"><em>Shadows of Self </em>is the second book in the Wax &amp; Wayne series, continuing to chronicle the adventures of its titular characters in the world of Scadrial. <em>Shadows of Self </em>is a huge improvement over <em>Alloy of Law </em>and actually sets up an interesting narrative for the next two sequels. It also marks the first time where we see how technology and magic interact within the Cosmere narrative.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>13. <em>Rhythm of War </em>(The Stormlight Archive #4)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">The fourth <em>Stormlight Novel </em>entertained a painfully sluggish pace and featured a ton of filler subplots. That’s not to say <em>Rhythm of War </em>isn’t important or any good. In fact, if this book had been 300-400 pages shorter, I would’ve loved every second of reading it. But as it stands, <em>Rhythm of War </em>is probably the weakest novel in Sanderson’s so-called Magnum Opus.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Dragonsteel Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>12. <em>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="805" data-injectable="true">The story takes place on the planet Komashi, where the shard of Virtuosity has shattered herself. Our favorite world-hopper and storyteller Hoid is trapped on Komashi, and he tells readers the story of Yumi, a highly powerful individual in this world, and Nikaro, who is a nightmare painter contracted by the government to stop the nightmares released from the Shroud. The epic factor takes a back seat for this particular outing, because <em>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</em> is, at its heart, a romantic story.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>11. <em>The Lost Metal </em>(Wax &amp; Wayne #4)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true"><em>The Lost Metal </em>brought the story of Waxillium Ladrian and Wayne to a satisfying conclusion. While you’d generally be hard-pressed to rank any of the <em>Wax &amp; Wayne </em>books higher than the first <em>Mistborn </em>era, the end of this saga will bring you to tears, and that is a testament to Sanderson’s ability to write compelling characters and interesting narratives, even if at times it might feel like things can’t possibly come so neatly together.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>10. <em>The Final Empire </em>(Mistborn #1)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true">The first book in the <em>Mistborn </em>trilogy and the story that made Sanderson’s name, <em>The Final Empire </em>takes readers to the planet Scadrial, where a tyrannical god-emperor called the Lord Ruler is presiding over a world on the brink of catastrophe. <em>The Final Empire </em>tells the tale of a band of misfit rebels as they try to bring together the slave class to topple this invincible, immortal god-emperor. Many fans and Sanderson himself recommend <em>The Final Empire </em>as an entry point into the Cosmere narrative.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>9. <em>The Bands of Mourning </em>(Wax &amp; Wayne #3)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="572" data-current-count="872" data-injectable="true">As mentioned earlier, the second <em>Mistborn </em>era, more commonly known as the <em>Wax &amp; Wayne </em>series, fails to soar to the same heights as the original trilogy, but there’s an exception to this rule, and that exception is <em>The Bands of Mourning</em>. There’s much brilliant character work underlying this second-to-last chapter in the story, and the events that lead up to the finale will leave you enthralled. Every Brandon Sanderson fan should read the second <em>Mistborn </em>era, if for nothing besides experiencing the sheer awesomeness of <em>The Bands of Mourning </em>and <em>The Lost Metal</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Dragonsteel Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>8. <em>Tress of the Emerald Sea</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="956" data-injectable="true"><em>Tress of the Emerald Sea </em>was the first Secret Project to be released following Sanderson’s Kickstarter campaign. The novel started as a personal gift to Sanderson’s wife, but when the book was finished and read by her, she convinced Sanderson to release it. Now, <em>Tress of the Emerald Sea </em>is among the author’s best published novels, with many fans even putting it in their top 5 Cosmere list. Hoid is back, and this time he tells a story that took place in years long past. <em>Tress of the Emerald Sea </em>is intimate, heartfelt, sincere, and a great read overall, even if you don’t understand the obvious Cosmere references sprinkled throughout the book.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tachyon Publications</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>7. <em>The Emperor’s Soul</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="897" data-injectable="true"><em>The Emperor’s Soul </em>won the Hugo Award for best novella in 2013. This short story revolves around a thief named Shai, who gets caught during her latest hustle. Shai also practices magical forgery, which is convenient for her in this case, because the emperor has been left brain-dead following an assassination attempt. The monarch’s advisors petition Shai to forge a new soul for the emperor and earn her freedom. Shai and Gaotona, one of the emperor’s advisors, research his life and try to understand where a man of ideals went wrong, all in an attempt to reconstruct his soul in 100 days.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>6. <em>The Well of Ascension</em> (Mistborn #2)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="897" data-injectable="true">While <em>The Well of Ascension </em>is not an action-heavy book, it does pack a lot of philosophical dilemmas into its narrative. How do people tackle the socio-economic problems of an empire that is steadily burning in the fires of greed and hatred? Is there a case to be made for democracy? What does it mean to pick up the mantle of a leader? And the best thing about <em>The Well of Ascension </em>is the mind-numbing twist at the end of the book. I’ve been bamboozled by stories and books and narratives more times than I can count, but the second <em>Mistborn </em>book will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Gollancz</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>5. <em>Warbreaker</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="583" data-current-count="883" data-injectable="true">Sanderson is one of the most prolific writers alive, but despite publishing more than 30 novels, he’s still mostly known for a select few. <em>Warbreaker </em>is one of them, detailing the story of two sister princesses, Vivenna and Siri, when they get embroiled in a political conflict between their nation of Idris and the rival kingdom of Hallandren. <em>Warbreaker </em>also marks the debut of a prominent <em>Stormlight </em>character and has been well-received by fans and critics alike. And the best part? You can head over to Sanderson’s official website right now and read <em>Warbreaker </em>for free.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>4. <em>Oathbringer </em>(The Stormlight Archive #3)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">The third <em>Stormlight Novel </em>centers around the origin story of one of the protagonists, Dalinar Kholin, a.k.a. Blackthorn. It also includes the biggest battle against the Voidbringers as the Knights Radiant come together to thwart their assault on one of the Rosharan countries. If we consider <em>The Stormlight Archive </em>to be first and foremost a book about moral philosophy, then <em>Oathbringer </em>is where that point reaches a powerful crescendo.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>3. <em>The Hero of Ages </em>(Mistborn #3)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="756" data-current-count="1056" data-injectable="true">The culmination of the first <em>Mistborn </em>era happens in <em>The Hero of Ages</em>. Having learned the buried truth about their world, Vin, Elend, and the rest of the gang have to race against the most primordial force in existence to save Scadrial from devastation. <em>The Hero of Ages </em>is a great book, and beyond that, a testament to Brandon Sanderson’s ability to weave a very complex narrative together. Almost every plot thread from the trilogy has a satisfying payoff in <em>The Hero of Ages</em>, and every character finds their resolution to one degree or another by the end of the book. <em>Mistborn </em>certainly has its ups and downs, but read all three books and you begin to understand why people often bring up its name when talking about the best fantasy books in history.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>2. <em>Words of Radiance </em>(The Stormlight Archive #2)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="718" data-current-count="1018" data-injectable="true">The second <em>Stormlight Archive </em>book continues Kaladin Stormblessed’s story in the war camps. Shallan Davar is also joining the frontlines to investigate the Voidbringers, while Dalinar Kholin struggles to form an alliance with the Highprinces and defeat the Parshendi once and for all. Things come to a head when the Alethi plan a decisive offensive against the Parshendi, little knowing that the strange marbled creatures have plans of their own. No matter how far Sanderson goes, <em>Words of Radiance </em>will remain one of his best books. (It might interest you to know <em>Words of Radiance </em>is also the highest-rated book on Goodreads, followed by <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows </em>and Leigh Bardugo’s <em>Crooked Kingdom</em>.)</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>1. <em>The Way of Kings </em>(The Stormlight Archive #1)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="1027" data-injectable="true">I have zero doubts that <em>The Way of Kings </em>is a literary achievement that will be studied many years from now. Setting up one of the most ambitious and imaginative fantasy worlds ever attempted, <em>The Way of Kings </em>came out in 2010 and began <em>The Stormlight Archive </em>in earnest, introducing us to unforgettable characters like Kaladin Stormblessed, Shallan Davar, and Dalinar Kholin. Kaladin’s character arc and backstory, Dalinar’s struggles with his unsettling visions, the trials of Bridge Four, and ultimately, the build-up to the final battle on the Shattered Plains and its aftermath, are all a masterclass in superb storytelling. <em>The Way of Kings </em>is, without a doubt, Sanderson’s crowning achievement as a fantasy author.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Concept art for ‘Wind and Truth’ by Randy Vargas</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-forthcoming-works-set-in-the-cosmere" data-injectable="false"><strong>Forthcoming works set in the Cosmere</strong></h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">The next <em>Stormlight </em>book is coming out on December 6, 2024. Titled <em>Wind and Truth</em>, this fifth installment will conclude the first <em>Stormlight </em>arc. Sanderson will follow that up with another secret project called <em>Isles of the Emberdark</em>. Then we’ll be off to the third <em>Mistborn </em>era, set in the post-industrial period, equivalent to our own 1980s.</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false">After we’re finished with the third <em>Mistborn </em>series, Cosmere stans can expect to see one or two sequels for <em>Elantris</em>, followed by the second <em>Stormlight Archive </em>arc, spanning another five books. Sanderson will probably release a couple of spinoff novels and novellas along the way too, and then, the entire Cosmere will come together for a definitive conclusion in the fourth science fiction-themed <em>Mistborn </em>era.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-you-pull-verdant-summit-without-jiyan-in-wuthering-waves.883308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-pull-verdant-summit-without-jiyan-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=should-you-pull-verdant-summit-without-jiyan-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>Wuthering Waves,</em> weapons make up a fairly significant portion of your character’s power. You might be considering rolling for Verdant Summit, even without Jiyan, and if you are, then I’ve got the answer you seek.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-worth-pulling-verdant-summit-with-no-jiyan-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Is it worth pulling Verdant Summit with no Jiyan in <em>Wuthering Waves?</em></h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">To be completely upfront, even if you don’t have Jiyan, <strong>Verdant Summit </strong>is absolutely worth pulling for several different reasons. For one, Verdant Summit has literally all the hallmarks of a strong universal weapon. It comes with CRIT DMG as its secondary stat, which is already insanely valuable considering it’s the only one of its type in the game. Its ability is also valuable for every single Broadsword character. </p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Despite it not being his sword, Verdant Summit is Calcharo’s BiS (Best in Slot) weapon. Taoqi, a defense scaling character, also makes great use of Verdant Summit’s stats and passive ability. This is just an example of how universal a weapon this is. It is a potent stat stick that makes the steep cost of pulling worthwhile.</p> <figure data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-Verdant-Summit-Taoqi.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">One thing you might want to consider, though, is the odds of another universal Broadsword releasing in the near future. Due to <em>Wuthering Waves </em>being a gacha game and RPG, the odds of this occurring is quite high. This doesn’t mean Verdant Summit will suddenly become useless though. </p> <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">Based on how <em>Wuthering Wave’s </em>weapons have been so far, most of them tend to be rather useful on several characters, and not highly specialized. This is always a godsend because it means less pulling on the weapon banner for a character. Often, the second or third-best weapon for a character is still rather powerful, so having something like Verdant Summit on your account is an excellent thing, especially if you’re planning to stick with <em>Wuthering Waves </em>for the long haul.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Furthermore, the versatility of Verdant Summit extends beyond just raw stats. Its passive abilities synergize well with a variety of characters due to how generally useful it is. This adaptability means investing in Verdant Summit isn’t just about boosting individual characters; it can elevate your entire account’s performance if you have multiple 5-star weapons equipped to characters. </p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Given the ever-evolving meta of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, having a weapon that can seamlessly integrate into multiple builds provides a strategic advantage. Future-proofing your arsenal with Verdant Summit ensures you remain competitive and prepared for any new characters or challenges that may arise, making it a wise long-term investment.</p>

<p data-characters="427" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Even if you don’t know much about the band Slipknot, it’s nearly impossible that reading the name doesn’t immediately make the images of various immensely cool and gruesome masks flash in front of your eyes. These masks aren’t just bought in a secret section of a Halloween store than only metal musicians have access to. They are are designed by, among other wizards of gore, this man called Jim Ojala.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Ojala stepped out of his comfort zone – Hell, I’m assuming – to accept Atlus’ challenge and create masks based on a few characters from the upcoming <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. </em>You can witness the process and the results below:</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Ojala explains the steps of his process, which is great, but some of the results look just too good for the common mortal to achieve. Gurulu’s mask, for example, looks like it’s made from the actual skull of a fantastical creature that Ojala just captured and butchered somewhere. It’s neat, and wise that Ojala has made this cool video to prove his demon-slaying innocence.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="754" data-injectable="true">Loup-Garou’s mask also looks cool, probably the most Slipknot-ish one of the bunch, as it looks like a spicier version of your regular Werewolf. The coolest takeaway for me, however, is that some of his masks look even scarier on the inside. Check out how Daemon’s insides provide just the perfect blueprint for an evil version of Sonic The Hedgehog:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Atlus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="false">You will be able to experience <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, when it comes out on June 14 for Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Homemade Slipknot-esque mask optional, of course.</p>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In an incident Super Earth has dubbed a “close call,” 12 scientists were “spaghettified” when a Dark Matter experiment created a micro black hole. Bummer. But here’s the good news: <em>Helldivers 2</em> may finally get the Illuminate faction soon with this latest tease.</p> <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players have been embroiled in a new Major Order following the successful acquisition of a hot new mech Stratagem that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-new-mech-is-a-hotly-contested-topic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everybody agrees is perfect</a>. The order has Helldivers clearing the path to the planet Meridia so that Super Earth command can wipe out a Terminid Supercolony with a weapon made with Dark Matter. That’s all great, despite the unfortunate setback. But what’s important is where Dark Matter came from and how it teases future <em>Helldivers 2</em> content.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-shines-light-on-the-illuminate" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> shines light on the Illuminate</h2> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">As explained in the mission briefing, Dark Matter is a substance liberated from Super Earth’s age-old enemy (among others) the Illuminate. So far, the game has only done so much to hint the return of the high-tech foe, with some theories <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-illuminates-have-popped-back-up-in-an-unexpected-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not really panning out</a>. But their appearance may be just around the corner. Johan Pilestedt, the new CCO of Arrowhead, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-cant-take-all-the-illuminate-teases-from-the-devs-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased the faction</a> earlier in May, and players think the recent Dark Matter disagreement can at last herald their arrival.</p>

That’s certainly one theory put out by players, though the origin of said black hole may not come from the enemy faction itself. Considering the recent incident, a black hole manufactured by Super Earth could also open the door for the Illuminate to use. Based on what Pilestedt has said, however, it’s more likely that the faction will appear on its own terms. </p>

<p data-characters="253" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A big day for visual novel aficionados is just around the corner. <em>Tsukihime </em>is finally getting an official Western release with its remake, <em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-</em>, and today publisher Aniplex shared the opening animation to set the tone.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Set to the song “Seimeisen” by ReoNA, the animation sets a pretty familiar tone if you’ve watched, read, or played some Type-Moon work. There’s a main protagonist and some best friends, various characters preparing for a night of battle ahead, and then some flashy, climactic showdowns involving both magic and steel.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="TSUKIHIME -A piece of blue glass moon- Opening Animation" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/My-qnPrDIzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">It does, admittedly, feel a bit like an anime opening more than a game opening. But considering this is setting the vibe for a visual novel, it makes sense to focus on animating some of the big conflicts and action-heavy moments, with (presumably) a few sly nods towards the more dramatic and memorable scenes in the VN.</p> <h2 id="h-a-new-moon" data-injectable="false">A new moon</h2> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">If you don’t know <em>Tsukihime </em>by name alone, it’s a pretty notable entry in the lineup of visual novels, especially for those who dig the works of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/witch-on-the-holy-night-type-moon-launch-switch-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kinoku Nasu</a>. The author wrote <em>Tsukihime </em>and released it in 2000, four years ahead of his next work <em>Fate/stay night</em>, which would go on to spawn the <em>Fate </em>universe and series, with dozens of spin-offs in its wake.</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">While the <em>Fate </em>series, and even broader Nasu-verse stories that incorporate <em>Tsukihime </em>characters like <em>Melty Blood</em>, have seen U.S. releases, this is the first official port of <em>Tsukihime</em>. This specific entry, <em>-A piece of blue glass moon-</em>, is set to adapt the “Near Side” storyline. A second entry, <em>Tsukihime -The other side of red garden-</em>, will tackle the Far Side storyline somewhere down the line.</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><em>Tsukihime </em>follows Shiki Tohno, who starts seeing “lines of death” after a childhood accident. This superpower alone seems like enough to carry a narrative, but soon, he starts unraveling even darker mysteries lurking in his hometown. I’ve not read it yet and stayed fairly spoiler-free, but my understanding is that magic and possibly vampires get involved.</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">So it’s a pretty big piece of visual novel history, finally getting an official release in the west. Those who want to experience the origin point of the Nasu-verse will probably be excited to dig into <em>Tsukihime</em>, as well as the <em>Fate/stay night </em>remaster also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fate-stay-night-remastered-switch-pc-announcement-type-moon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for release</a> sometime this year. Really, it’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/20-of-the-best-visual-novels-you-can-play-on-switch-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just a good time</a> to be reading some visual novels.</p>
 <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="87" data-injectable="false"><em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>arrives on June 27 for Switch and PlayStation 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-new-announced-at-paizocon-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend, Paizo Inc. held PaizoCon 2024. This online convention is dedicated to beloved fans of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder"><em>Starfinder</em></a> series, featuring developers discussing upcoming products and features coming to the popular TTRPGs. These panels did discuss products already announced, but also revealed new products and information.</p>

<h2>The PaizoCon 2024 Announcements</h2>

<p>PaizoCon 2024 opened with a keynote speech by Paizo's own Erik Mona. In the speech, Mona briefly discusses previously announced products. These include the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-remaster-previewed-by-paizo-inc"><em>Pathfinder Remastered</em></a> books, the hotly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october">Tian Xia</a> sourcebooks, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-war-of-immortals-event-announced-by-paizo"><em>War of Immortals</em></a> event, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-updates-revealed-by-paizo-president"><em>Howl of the Wild</em></a> supplement, and <em>Starfinder Second Edition</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paizocon-2024-pathfinder-npc-core.jpg?itok=7muBRNtP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paizocon-2024-pathfinder-npc-core.jpg?itok=qqHH7iq_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So many interesting people to use.</figcaption></figure><p>It is in the dedicated panels that more details emerged. When discussing the Remastered project, Jon Morgantini, Logan Bonner, James Case, Josh Birdsong, Luis Loza described what would be coming in the <em>Player Core 2</em> book.</p>

<p>They confirm a brand new dragonblood ancestry. It is a versatile ancestry with four different lineages. Its ancestry feats will include breath weapons, claws, and being able to change into a dragon.</p>

<p>The Barbarian and Champion got major changes for character classes. Barbarians can Rage at start of initiative as well as rage multiple times in combat. Champion abilities are no longer tied to alignment, but focus more on causes. This means certain spells and abilities can be chosen more freely.</p>

<p>This PaizoCon 2024 panel ends with a new book announcement. <em>Pathfinder NPC Core</em> is a book packed with NPCs for GMs to use in their campaigns. Thieves, villains, dwarves, elves, regular citizens living their lives, the list goes on. It will release Spring 2025.</p>

<p>During the Tian Xia panel, James Case, Ruvaid Virk, Eleanor Ferron, Ianara Natividad explains what players can anticipate. They confirm the Character Guide will contain six new ancestries. These include the new tiefling Hungerseed Heritage, which ties your bloodline to Oni, as well as trickster Kitsune.</p>

<p>In addition, there are new martial arts-themed feats. These include various Wuxia-inspired abilities like water walking and limited flight. There are also more fantastical acts like growing in size or summoning evil spirits. The Tian Xia Character Guide will release in August.</p>

The panel does confirm that new gods and demigods will be introduced in the upcoming books, as well as some changes to pantheons and holy symbols.</p>

<p>The panel also introduces two new god-oriented groups. Covenants are similar to pantheons but are for other entities. An example is the Endless Skies covenant where a group of minor air entities empowers the player. Second is Mortal Heralds, a new player archetype where you become an avatar of a god.</p>

<p>Lastly, the panel confirms that the Godsrain will bring back Mythic player options for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>. As the name implies, these options make iconic characters even more impressive. They include not just feats but spells, weapons, and armor.</p>

            <p>
Xbox Game Studios has reportedly signed a deal to publish the first project from Hundred Star Games, the new studio established by Rocksteady co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker.
</p>
<p>
Hill and Walker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-studio-founders-leaving-rocksteady-to-begin-new-adventure-in-gaming">announced their departure</a> from Batman Arkham studio Rocksteady in October 2022, and Hundred Star Games was founded the following April. However, the pair's connection to the studio wasn't spotted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-co-founders-have-formed-new-london-aaa-studio-hundred-star-games">until early this year</a>, alongside the discovery a "handful of lead developers and director-level ex-Rocksteady employees" was already working there.
</p>
<p>
While little official is known about Hundred Star Games' activities to date - aside from its stated aim of employing a "small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents" - reliable leaker eXtas1s now reports Microsoft's Xbox Game Studios has signed on the dotted line to publish and finance the developer's first title.

<p>
Details on the project remain extremely limited, but eXtas1s (writing <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/hundred-star-xbox-aaa-project/">for Exputer</a>) claims it'll be an AAA-caliber single-player action-adventure build in Unreal Engine 5. This is "likely" to be a platform exclusive title, according to eXtas1s - but that might ultimately depend on how Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">recent multiplatform strategy</a> evolves.
</p>
<p>
Hill and Walker were previously involved with Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, but departed the studio long before the much-delayed game finally released earlier this year. Kill the Justice League drew praise for its presentational panache but few had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">anything especially positive to say</a> about its live-service core. Word that Hill and Walker are returning to single-player action-adventure territory after their successes with Rocksteady's Batman Arkham games is certainly intriguing if today's report proves to be true.

<p id="09PAOE">This is the final step in a series of “<strong>Where in the System is Archie</strong>” quests in the wake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124384/destiny-2-into-the-light-patch-notes-onslaught-whisper-zero-hour">Into the Light</a> update — which have been staggered out week-by-week in the lead up to <em>The Final Shape.</em></p>
<p id="BmOKAA">Note this quest <strong>expires on the June 3</strong> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24144172/weekly-reset-time-when">weekly reset</a> — a full day before <em>The Final Shape</em> launches on June 4. This is because Bungie will take <em>Destiny 2</em> down for 24 hours ahead of the expansion.</p>
<p id="qn5l3t">Remember, provided you complete <em>any </em>Archie quest before the arrival of <em>The Final Shape</em>, you’ll get your hands on the Blue Steel shader, while the lore for all Archie quests will be available from June 4 on. </p>

<p id="2QfO8E">Land in Liming and make your way north to the Lost Sector entrance. Walk inside and just do the normal version — as-in don’t launch the Legend or Master version if they’re available — and eventually you’ll find Archie waiting by a claw machine. Do not go through the Vex portal at the end. If you do, you’ll miss Archie, who is to the right of the portal.</p>
