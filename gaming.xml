              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, over 30 developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">were fired from Rockstar Games</a>. A trade labor group claims the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> studio was union busting, but Rockstar Games now claims the employees were leaking sensitive information. The dispute comes just as the long-awaited blockbuster is getting ready to ship in May 2026.</p> <p>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,” a Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the nature of the confidential information that was allegedly disclosed.</p> <p>The ex-Rockstar developers were in a private message group on Discord with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) when they were fired last week for what parent company Take-Two called at the time “gross misconduct.” The IWGB has been seeking to organize developers across various UK-based gaming studios, including <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/"><em>Disco Elysium</em> maker ZA/UM</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><em>MindsEye</em> maker Build a Rocket Boy</a>.</p>

 <p>“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to <em>GTA 6</em>, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game,” IWGB president Alex Marshall told <em>Bloomberg</em> in response to Rockstar’s new allegations. He maintained the fired employees were only discussing issues related to “exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”</p> <p>The IWGB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date has already slipped once and some are <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/gta-6-launch-postponed">placing bets</a> that it could miss the new May 26 release date as well. The game has had one of the most secretive development cycles of any major blockbuster, outside of the details leaked in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">an unprecedented hack</a> back in 2022. Since then, Rockstar has only released two official trailers.</p>

<li>If you never open the box screen after the box runs out before the first runaway Mega Shinka battle, you will definitely fail to catch the Pokémon. Also, if you proceed with a side mission where you can obtain a Pokémon in that state, you will not be able to obtain it and it will be completed.</li>
<li>In some side missions, if day and night switch at the same time as the move hits the target to be hit, you will not be able to hit the move after that, and the side mission will not be able to proceed.</li>
<li>In a trainer battle, when the opposing trainer changes a Pokémon, if a player plays Mega Shinka at the same time, the opponent's trainer will not play the Pokémon and will be unable to proceed.</li>
<li>Fixed some other issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ranked Battles Balance Adjustments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust the points that can be earned according to the ranking so that the points do not drop depending on the result of the game.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually, finding a laptop that powers everything without slowing down means spending serious money. Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop rewrites that equation completely: This machine packs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">professional-grade specs into a package that now costs $995, down from its typical $3,299 price tag</a>. That is a <strong>$2,304 discount</strong> that brings enterprise-level performance within reach of students and anyone tired of their sluggish laptop holding them back.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Workload</h2>
<p>Inside is an Intel Core 7 150U processor that drives this machine up to 5.4 GHz across 10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. This hybrid architecture essentially means the laptop knows when to unleash full power for demanding tasks and when to dial back for basic browsing, really maximizing both speed and battery life.</p>
<p>The 12 threads enable the processor to juggle multiple operations at one time, so you can render a video while downloading files and streaming music without watching everything grind to a halt.<strong> Intel’s Core 7 also includes dedicated CPU, GPU, and NPU engines</strong> that accelerate AI-powered features in Windows 11.</p>



<p>That <strong>32GB of DDR5 memory</strong> makes a tangible difference in daily use. DDR5 is the latest memory standard that’s faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4. You can have 50 browser tabs open, run Adobe Creative Suite applications and have Spotify playing in the background, then jump between everything in an instant. The 1TB SSD provides ample room for your operating system without needing to constantly manage space or use external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen display runs at a 1920×1200 resolution</strong>, and provides more space vertically than the standard 1920×1080 screens. Those extra 120 pixels make spreadsheets easier to read and mean less scrolling when working with documents. With its 300-nit brightness, the screen can stay visible in bright rooms or near windows, and its anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that cause eye strain during long work sessions. The touchscreen adds intuitive interaction: pinch fingers to zoom in on photos, swipe through documents, and navigate Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface with your fingers.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports for legacy peripherals, including mice and external hard drives; a Thunderbolt 4 port that enables 40Gbps data transfer to drives and enables the driving of high-resolution external monitors; an HDMI port suitable for presentations and second screens; and a universal audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>With this Dell Inspiron laptop, performance that would normally cost three times more is available for 70% off.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games says it didn’t fire employees for attempting to form a union. Rather, the studio behind Grand Theft Auto 6 says that staff let go were done so for leaking company information.</p>



<p>In a new report from Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, the employees were giving out company secrets in a forum with non-Rockstar staff. This led to more than 30 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p><strong>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,”</strong> a Rockstar spokesperson told Schreier. <strong>“This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-was-the-union-s-response">What Was The Union’s Response?</h2>



<p>It just so happens, however, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone who was let go</a> also took park in a private union chat on Discord. The only people outside of Rockstar involved in the chat, they say, were labor organizers.</p>



<p>The president of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, Alex Marshall, said that Rockstar was simply <strong>“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to&nbsp;GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive for comment on the situation. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In the meantime, Take-Two Interactive is preparing for its latest quarterly earnings report on November 6.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ball-x-pit-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ball-x-pit-review.1345180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a new, all-consuming obsession, and that obsession is Ball x Pit. I didn't set out to replace all my free time with grinding its roguelite take on Breakout, but its reliance on strategy (with a butterfly kiss of luck) and enticing upgrade paths both on and off the playfield grabbed a hold of the primal lizard parts of my brain to the detriment of all other civilized activity. I am <em>hooked</em>. In fact, Ball x Pit is the only video game I've played since I first started it a couple weeks ago. I cannot break free from its satisfying loop of running a level and upgrading my balls, upgrading my city to unlock more balls, and then jumping right back in. It's a sickness, a sickness with no cure – and, honestly… I'm not even sure I'd want to be healed from the madness that has taken hold of me. I’ve been recommending it to everyone and, so far, those who have taken my advice inevitably reach out to tell me the same thing: "You ruined my life, you sicko." It’s fantastic. Join us. We all bounce down here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a distance, Ball x Pit looks like one of those crappy games you see advertised on TikTok or Reels. You know the ones: "We're playing a game the comments said was fake part 17," or something like that. At first blush, it does look like some endless runner game trying to hook you with playtime gems or whatever predatory garbage is in vogue these days. But, crucially, it’s <em>not</em> one of those games at all, as it’s entirely free of microtransactions and actually respects your time as it vacuums it all up. It doles out satisfying upgrades in each level and then gives you the opportunity to build up more permanent powers in your home base. There's nothing cheap or underhanded about it. It makes you feel powerful, not cheated, and even with an element of RNG in each level, it requires you to make the most out of every opportunity rather than rely on dumb luck or random chance. When you beat a level, it feels like you earned it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual gameplay seems straightforward on the surface, too: Your character, or characters, march up the playfield firing bouncing balls at wave after wave of enemies. The balls are weaponized, the enemies are crushed under the onslaught, and eventually you get to a given level’s unique boss. That's the basic loop, but the operative word there is "basic." Because, friends, Ball x Pit is much more complex. For starters, there are different kinds of balls to fire. For example, your initial character, the Warrior, starts with a special ball that imparts a "bleed" status effect that stacks up to cause extra damage on successive hits. As you defeat enemies, you’ll also pick up gems in order to level up, which then gives you a choice of balls and other power-ups to use during that specific run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are special balls with status effects or area-of-effect damage, balls that spawn more "baby balls" (weird), and loads of other options. Then there are buffs, passive effects, defensive boosts, and even allies who'll join you in the march forward, dealing out damage or even health. Some of the power ups are much better than others. The Earthquake ball, for example, deals damage around the enemy it hits and, like most of the AOE balls, becomes incredibly powerful when fully upgraded. Others, like the Wretched Onion, kind of suck. Part of the fun is finding out which upgrades work best in any given level, as well as discovering what happens when you combine certain balls with Fusions and Evolutions that mix or modify their powers even further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you're fully powered up and the RNG gods have held you in their favor, it's a beautiful bloodbath.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fusions can simply save you a slot by mashing two effects onto a single ball, but specific combos instead get the chance to evolve into a new power. For example, fusing the Horizontal Laser with the Vertical Laser creates my personal favorite, the Holy Laser. It shoots beams of pure fiery death vertically <em>and </em>horizontally on hit while also dealing AOE damage, which is as useful much as it just rules. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that fusing balls both scales the damage you are dealing and gives you room to add even more. It's hard to keep track of all the possibilities, but there's an in-game encyclopedia that shows you the combos you've unlocked. I'm more than 30 hours in and I still have fusions I haven't found yet, which I find pretty damn exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, the laser balls in any configuration do a crap-ton of damage, searing rows and columns, sometimes adding stackable status effects like radiation while also doing normal, hot laser damage. When you're fully powered up and the RNG gods have held you in their favor, it's a beautiful bloodbath. Lasers and explosions and effects are going off constantly, and the damage counters fill the screen as entire rows of enemies evaporate into experience gems, as well as gold you’ll spend back in your town between runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The town is the other half of Ball x Pit, one that's enormously important to growing your characters. In addition to earning permanent stat boosts just by playing as them, constructing certain buildings and character houses will provide buffs and bonuses as well, which you’ll absolutely need in order to make it through the later levels. But while it’s very important, the city-building part of Ball x Pit is extremely clunky – in fact, it’s probably the worst part of what I think is otherwise a flawless game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete a level, whether or not you did so successfully, you're thrown back into the town interface where you’ll build structures from blueprints you gathered out in the field. You also build resource tiles: forests for wood, fields for wheat, and rocks for… well, rocks. Those resources, in addition to gold, are required to build and upgrade new structures. Thankfully there are plenty of ways to gather resources outside of just harvesting, including during runs and with passive buildings like the stone quarry, but collecting it manually is the most fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the harvest phase, you use your unlocked characters as balls, taking aim from the bottom of the board and letting them rip, Beyblade style, in the direction of the stuff you want to hit. They then bounce off the walls and buildings, collecting resources from the resource tiles and upgrading any buildings you marked for improvement. This process is amusing but also fairly tedious, as you can move buildings around before you harvest in order to optimize their placement, but there isn’t really a convenient way to do so. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>City building is the worst part of an otherwise a flawless game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What I usually end up doing is moving everything off to one side of the map, then shuffling all the parts and pieces back again to where I want them at that specific moment. It almost seems like Ball x Pit is aware of how cumbersome the city building is, because there's no penalty or resource cost for moving tiles around. What I'd love to see is some kind of option to wipe the slate clean without needing to go through and manually remove every building, or maybe a holding pen where I could drop structures temporarily while I reconfigure my layout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you will be reconfiguring your layout a lot. Building upgrades require your characters to bounce off the buildings multiple times, and if that building is in a weird location, good luck getting the trajectory right to consistently hit it enough times during the harvest phase without reorganizing half the town. I often ended up moving relevant buildings down near the launch area, which meant moving all the other stuff away… and then reorganizing it again after all is said and done. I don't like it at all. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Seth's Game DNA</h3><p>These are the games that made me the gamer I game game game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a bummer because you can’t really ignore this, as city layout is extremely important to how powerful you are in the levels themselves. Some buildings provide buffs that make the effects of other nearby buildings stronger, so their placement is crucial to your continued success. That need for careful planning is at odds with the reality of constantly shuffling tiles around when it comes time to harvest, build, and upgrade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, building-specific issues aside, I do really like how your town structures contribute directly to the action itself. The better your city, the better your characters, and the more blueprints you find, the more options you have when it comes to a new run. It may be cumbersome to move everything around, but the results are meaningful and can sometimes be surprising in a way that is ultimately a positive. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Double Down on Strategy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat early on, you unlock a building that lets you bring two characters into battle instead of just one, adding another layer of complexity and experimentation to each run. At first, it almost feels like cheating, but it would be functionally impossible to get much further without it. I'm still figuring out which combinations work well and which ones are total crap. Since you still gain gold and experience even on a failed run, I don't even mind when I pick a total dud combo because I've still made some progress. There have also been several times where I thought I'd figured out some god-tier combo, only to get three-quarters of the way through a level and realize I have made a terrible mistake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The worst was when I paired The Warrior with The Flagellant for a New Game+ run of the first level. Balls shot by the Flagellant bounce off the bottom of the screen instead of the top, and The Warrior has no special attributes other than being your starting character. The first level boss, the Skeleton King, requires hits to the back of its skull to inflict damage. The RNG gods had graced me with some decent fusions, but all of them ended up bouncing harmlessly between his two arms out front, leaving me almost completely ineffective. An errant baby ball would sometimes bank off the wall to register a tiny amount of damage, but I ended up losing on purpose just to back out of the level.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As frustrating as that was, it's emblematic of something I love about Ball x Pit: it requires strategy in almost every facet. The balls and upgrades offered to you are at the mercy of RNG, sure, but you also have the choice of which ones to use and which ones to fuse and evolve. I was able to identify good combinations and bad combinations of characters based on their attributes and would make mental notes about which pairings would work out for my specific needs as I pushed through each level. The Juggler, for example, throws balls over enemies – pairing him with The Shade, whose balls shoot from the back of the field, and then following a heavy AOE upgrade path allowed me to clear out basically any row of enemies on the board while still getting a ton of damage from balls bouncing in the back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That combination of strategy and knowing how to best upgrade any given character combination for a specific level is what keeps bringing me back, over and over again, until I'm bleary eyed and tired. When everything aligns and you're wiping out entire fields of enemies, when the screen is absolutely filled with lasers and explosions and baby balls scattering in every direction, you feel an enormous sense of power. From an outside view, honing in your upgrades combined with careful building placement and frequent stat leveling from buff buildings makes it seem like Ball x Pit would feel easier over time. But it does a rare thing: instead of feeling easy, it makes you feel powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I finally did beat the main story and watched the credits around the 20-hour mark, I immediately started up New Game+. I never do that. But the entirely inconsequential story is just a small part of Ball x Pit for me. The real joy here comes from building up your powers and combos and seeing what delights will unlock themselves during the course of a run. I play for moments when the music is nearly drowned out by the sounds of explosions and laser blasts, or when I get a gold bonus for clearing the field of enemies and then doing it two, three, even five more times in a given level. It scratches an itch deep within my lizard brain. Hard work pays off, but the right combinations of upgrades mixed in with a touch of luck pays off even more.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Ball x Pit is my favorite game of 2025. Even with a clunky city building phase you can’t afford to ignore, the actual action of its Breakout-inspired runs is enormously fun. I get stuck in a "just one more run" mindset every time I sit down to play what I swear is going to be a quick round or two. Its strategies run surprisingly deep for a simple brick-breaker, rewarding smart planning and forethought more so than RNG and luck alone. It's a rare game that I’m still excited to play well after I beat the main story and, in a lot of ways, I wish I were playing it right now. If you want your life to be completely upended by a seemingly simple brick-breaking roguelite, I cannot recommend it enough.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ball-x-pit-review]]></content:encoded>

And while the majority of what you find while scavenging topside will be useful materials and weapons, you'll also occasionally come across items that are designed to be sold for some extra cash. These items, known as trinkets, are designated by a small diamond symbol on their icons to indicate that they can be sold for profit. But they're not all created equally.</p><p>Trinkets come in four rarities: Common (White), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), and Epic (Purple). While there is occasionally variation between selling prices even among trinkets of the same rarity, these identifiers help to give you an idea of whether you've stumbled upon something truly special or not, with higher-tier items typically bringing in a bigger chunk of change.</p><p>In addition to being a way to rake in more money, a few trinkets also have uses back in Speranza.

              <p>Apple doesn’t usually advertise big discounts on its own website but the company quietly drops deals through Amazon from time to time. The MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage (which launched in March 2025) is no exception to this pattern. For the first time ever, a MacBook Air this recent is getting a serious price cut just months after its release: We saw it hit $799 during Prime Day, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings it down to $749 which marks a brand new all-time low from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Right MacBook for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>This is no ordinary laptop refresh: The 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip is <strong>Apple’s first consumer machine built from scratch for Apple Intelligence</strong>, the suite of AI-powered features transforming how you’ll interact with your Mac. The <strong>Retina display on this 13.6-inch gadget</strong> shows sharp text and brilliant colors at a resolution of 2560×1664, with 500 nits of brightness that makes everything from spreadsheets to Netflix binges look crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Beneath the cool Midnight aluminum chassis, you’ll find 16 GB of unified memory: <strong>That’s double what Apple offered in the base models</strong> until recently. That matters because unified memory is a little different from traditional RAM. It’s shared between the CPU and GPU so that both have instant access to the same pool of fast memory, without having to copy data back and forth. What this practically means is that you can keep dozens of browser tabs open, edit large photos, run many apps at once, and get zero slowdown. The 256GB SSD storage offers you enough room for your OS, most essential apps and a solid collection of files.</p>
<p>The M4 chip itself is a beast for everyday computing and <strong>touts an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that handle everything from web browsing up to light video editing without breaking a sweat. You get up to 18 hours of web browsing and up to 15 hours of video playback from one charge, which means you really can work all day long without having to hunt down an outlet. The<strong> chip also contains a 16-core Neural Engine</strong> that’s exclusively designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, powering features such as real-time language translation, advanced photo editing and Apple Intelligence capabilities.</p>



<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera sits centered above the display and keeps you in frame during video calls: As you move around, the camera pans and zooms to follow you, making remote meetings feel more natural and professional. Touch ID is integrated into the keyboard, allowing you to unlock your Mac, authenticate purchases, and switch between user accounts using only your fingerprint<strong>. Two Thunderbolt USB 4 ports provide transfer speeds up to 40Gbps</strong>, support for external displays up to 6K resolution, as well as fast charging.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just 2.7 pounds and 0.44 inches thin, the MacBook Air slips into any bag without adding noticeable weight to your daily carry.</p>
<p>And you’re getting a machine at $749 that should stay relevant for years to come, with Apple’s history of providing software updates for seven years or more.</p>

              <p><span>Google unveiled its latest and greatest Pixel 10 in August this year, but last year’s Pixel 9 is still a great option to invest in if you’re looking to upgrade. In fact, with prices on newer models climbing higher, the Pixel 9 is looking like one of the better value buys you can get right now, especially with the current drop.</span></p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/"> a 38% discount on this 2024 model, which brings the price down to $499</a>. That’s a straightforward $300 drop, and you don’t need to enter a coupon code or go through complicated checkout processes to secure the deal. The offer applies to all color options, including black, porcelain, and wintergreen. It’s also unlocked, meaning it’s going to work with all major carriers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simple Design, But Packed With Power</h2>
<p>This slim, sleek phone features curved edges and a glass front and back for that premium look. The 6.3-inch Actua display is bright, pushing crisp, detailed visuals to make the content pop. 120 Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, whether you’re just browsing or trying to play a game.</p>
<p>The phone is packed with Tensor G4, which is Google’s most powerful chip yet. There’s 12 GB RAM for lag-free performance, plus 128 GB storage to house all your essentials. You’ll be able to store tons of media content, all your favorite apps, games, and a lot more, without feeling limited.</p>



<p>You also get a 50MP main camera and a 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus. Google’s software takes it further with tools like Best Take (to help everyone look their best), Magic Editor (for quick editing), and Add Me (gets the whole group together in one photo). Whether you’re shooting on a bright sunny day or trying to record a scary prank at night, camera quality stays consistent throughout.</p>
<p>Gemini integration makes it even easier to get through your days and boring tasks. You can ask it to summarize content, circle an image or text to search the web, draft replies, etc. And since the Pixel 9 is fully unlocked, you’re free to use it with any major carrier, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Google Fi, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon also offers a trade-in program that could get you up to $650 in savings when you send in your old phone. The value is issued as gift card credit, but note that you might not be able to combine this with the current discount, so double-check the details before checking out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/philips-hue-smart-lighting-with-3-bulbs-reaches-new-record-low-amazon-cuts-nearly-50-off.1345126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lighting affects your mood, and smart lights make it easy to control both the brightness and color of your space. You can add warmth to your space when you feel like relaxing (also great for the holiday season), or go for a brighter setting for when you need to focus; all remotely.</p>
<p>Those ready to switch up the lighting situation in their home; we come bearing good news. You can now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/">grab the Philips Hue starter kit for just $97 on Amazon, thanks to a 46% discount</a>. That’s a rare drop from its regular $179 price, and you’re getting three A19 smart LED bulbs, a Hue Bridge, and a Hue Smart Button in the box. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. We just recommend acting fast to grab it, because the offer might end soon!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Million Colors, Plus a Wide Temperature Range</h2>
<p>Each bulb is a 75W-equivalent A19 LED. It supports both white and full color ambiance, meaning you can adjust the white temperature or pick from over a million colors to create a vibe that reflects how you’re feeling. Need to focus on a work task? Go for a brighter setting that lets you concentrate. Feel like relaxing after a long day? A nice, warm tone should help you wind down. Hosting a gathering on the weekend? Something playful, fun is going to leave your guests impressed!</p>



<p>You can adjust the lights through the Hue app, the included button, or even just use your voice to let Alexa or Google Assistant take care of it. The app gives you more control, as you can set timers, play around with the color palette, etc. As for the button, you can place it anywhere with the included magnet and use it for quick control. It lets you customize up to 5 scenes, so you can tweak settings without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Hue Bridge, which connects directly to your WiFi router to act as a hub for your system. You can use it to control lights from anywhere, plus unlock advanced features like automations and routines. And since it’s Matter compatible, you can always connect your lights to other smart home devices across platforms.</p>
<p>The setup is simple. All you need to do is install the bulbs, plug in the Philips Hue Bridge, and connect it to the WiFi router, then download the Hue app. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process within a few minutes!</p>

        <p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey—pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</p><p>The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision—thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying [intellectual property] is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we / NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out—we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/netease-games-closes-bad-brain-game-studios]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bitmap Bureau and Reef Entertainment's throwback side-scrolling game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F4DXP5FN,B0F4F1V647,B0F4DY6V7S,B0F4F1J8LQ,B0F4F2T4RB,B0F4DX5JBY,B0F4F3GRF7,B0F4F1GTJR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, has had some trouble getting out of the gate. Earlier this year, No Fate was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-has-been-delayed/1100-6533353/" data-ref-id="1100-6533353">pushed back to a Halloween release date</a>.

Now, Terminator 2D has been pushed back again, hopefully for the last time.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1718460/view/580528132884267069" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Reef Entertainment set a new launch date, December 12, for both the physical and digital versions. The company adds that it has the discs in hand, but it needs extra time to put together the physical editions.</p><p>"We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays," reads the statement. "We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there. Thank you again for standing by us. We're incredibly grateful, and we can't wait for you to finally experience Terminator 2D: No Fate soon."</p><p>The game is a loose adaptation of Terminator 2: Judgment Day that lets players control Sarah Connor and the heroic T-800 as they try to protect John Connor from the T-1000. If they live long enough, they may even prevent Skynet and its machines from nearly exterminating the human race. Players will also be able to control the adult John Connor during levels set in the future war against Skynet.</p><p>Terminator 2D: No Fate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-day-one-collector-edition-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6530886/" data-ref-id="1100-6530886">will have two physical editions</a>. The standard edition will go for $60, while a collector's edition has been priced at $120. The latter includes a reversible box art sleeve, a cloth poster, a 25mm collectible metal arcade coin featuring the game's logo, a full-color manual, and a collector’s box.</p>

              <p>We all rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and keeping all of them charged can get challenging. This is especially true for those who are out and about often and can’t afford to sit around waiting for one device to finish charging before plugging in the next. A multi-port, high-output charger can come in handy in these situations, and we just spotted a powerful option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">100W Baseus USB-C charger block is currently sitting at $29, after a massive 40% drop on its retail price of $49</a>. Both color options (black and white) are discounted. Even better, <strong>you can score a free USB-C cable (valued at $8)</strong> with your purchase. To claim it, click on the <em>“How to claim”</em> link next to the Get 1 free item label on the product page. In the tab that opens, add the charger to your cart, then navigate to the Benefit Item section and add the USB-C cable to your cart as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports to Juice Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>The charger comes with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can juice up to three devices at once. Using the single USB-C port gets you up to 100W of power, and when multiple devices are plugged in, Baseus’ BPS 3.0 smart power distribution automatically allocates the required output to each connected device.</p>



<p>Support for all major fast-charging protocols (PD 3.0, QC 3.0, and PPS) translates into efficient charging for a wide range of devices, whether it’s your smartphone, iPad, MacBook, or even Steam Deck. There’s thermal control built in, as well. Baseus Cooling Technology (BCT) monitors temperature consistently in real-time to prevent any overheating problems.</p>
<p>It’s also 43% more compact than most chargers out there, so carrying it around won’t feel heavy. The pins fold down, so you can easily throw the block in your bag or even your pocket and get going. It’s great for remote workers, travelling, plus convenient home use.</p>
<p>It’s now going for just $30, and it also lets you grab a free USB-C cable with your purchase for absolutely nothing. These deals won’t be around for long, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The popular Roblox game Grow a Garden is becoming a film from Story Kitchen. Even more so, the original developers are playing a big part in its production.</p>



<p>As part of the massively popular Roblox game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-square-enix-boss-calls-roblox-grow-a-garden-somewhat-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grow a Garden</a> is an idle multiplayer farming simulator. Players would buy and plant many types of crops and see their garden grow, hence the game. Despite the simple concept, it reached insane player counts in 2025, even beating out Fortnite. There’s clearly demand for more Grow a Garden and, now, it’ll be met on the big screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-story-kitchen-developing-grow-a-garden-film-with-original-developers">Story Kitchen Developing Grow a Garden Film with Original Developers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Roblox</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive article from Deadline</a>, the outlet confirmed that <strong>Roblox’s Grow a Garden is being adapted into a film. </strong>The movie is being produced by Story Kitchen, a well-known name in the adaptation landscape. Furthermore, <strong>the original creators</strong> will join the project to help with its development, acting as producers. A statement from Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg is available on Deadline, saying,</p>



<p>“<strong><em>Grow a Garden</em>&nbsp;is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt</strong>,” said the duo in the statement, “<strong>an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community</strong>.”</p>



<p>Plot details and release information is not available at this time. However, a brief description of the film <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is available on Deadline</a>. The film, currently in early development, will maintain the whimsical spirit of Grow a Garden and focus on nurturing and friendship. Given the simple concept, there’s a lot of room to experiment and craft something. Story Kitchen is producing almost a dozen game adaptations like Shinobi, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-getting-a-movie-in-case-you-missed-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Split Fiction, and Tomb Raider. Hopefully, the fruits of its labor will result in something, well, fruitful.</p>

            <p>
There is perhaps no better setting than some woods or a forest that just sucks ass. Just a confusing, scary, maybe sometimes enchanting mess of nature that is impossible to navigate. Today's latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> just so happens to present such a visage, with towering, beautiful trees, and yet again a wonderful sense of scale.
</p>
<p>
This new update is, appropriately, called Roots! I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the meaning there. Aside from the big old trees, there's also new nasties like spiders and giant beetles that will ruin your pilgrimage to the top, and, by the looks of the update's trailer, a fungal zombie infection that takes over your compatriots' bodies. Genuinely conceptually horrifying stuff for a game so cutesy. I like it!

<p>
The Roots biome comes with 11 new badges to earn too, and some biome-specific items too, like Shroomberries that have random effects, a couple of types of fungi, and some other, secret items. There's also some new items to be found across all biomes, like the rescue claw (does what it says on the tin), the checkpoint flag (does what it says on the tin), and the Book of Bones (does what it says on the tin?).
</p><p>
You'll also find that cooking has been overhauled. According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/809085268448511599?l=english">Steam post</a> about the update, "a lot more non-food items will now Actually Do Something when cooked," for one. Once cooked poisonous berries will be safe to eat, whereas poisonous mushrooms won't be. And cooked "usable but non-food items such as bandages will no longer grant Extra Stamina."
</p>
<p>
There are a few bug fixes too, and apparently the divorce court has permitted Bing Bong to visit his kids on weekends, which is a strange sentence to have written as a part of my job, but hey ho, I've got bills to pay. The Roots update is available right now, so have at ye.

              <p>Last month, cosplay streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitch-dan-clancy-assault-safety-investigation-2000639234">Emily “Emiru” Schunk</a> accused fellow Twitch star <a href="https://kotaku.com/mizkif-twitch-otk-allegations-apology-comeback-stream-1849944560">Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo</a> of sexually assaulting her. He’s now suing her and streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/asmongold-twitch-ban-youtube-gaza-israel-hasan-piker-1851672928">Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt</a>, who covered the allegations during multiple streams, for defamation over the fallout, including loss of equity from his former media company OTK as well as management fees from associated agencies who recently cut ties with him.</p> <p>“Through the acts and omissions described below, Defendants Schunk, Hoyt, and OTK have, acting in concert, wrongfully and baselessly accused Rinaudo of serious criminal activity for no purpose other than to harm him, his reputation, and his business—and wrest from him control of the companies that he helped build,” <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71869253/1/rinaudo-v-schunk/">the lawsuit</a>, filed in Texas District Court on November 3, reads (via <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/top-twitch-streamer-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-fellow-streamers/">KXAN</a>).</p> <p>Emiru accused Mizkif of “psychological and domestic abuse, stalking and harassment, sexual assault, and threats of blackmail” during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUmFyCt3yU">an October 25 livestream</a>. “He started kissing me in my face and I let him do it,” she said, detailing the alleged assault. “I was still sobbing a lot. And then suddenly he tried to climb on top of me and aggressively shoved his hands down my pants and I screamed. And when I screamed he jumped off me, like a cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OTK fully supports its co-owner and sister Emiru and we stand by her side and admire her strength in coming forward and sharing her story.</p> <p>While Mizkif was one of several founders of OTK, the organization terminated its relationship with him some time ago for reasons unrelated…</p> <p>— OTK (@OTKnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The lawsuit accuses Asmongold of piggybacking off these claims across multiple streams, calling Mizkif “the aggressor and abuser,” and saying that he should go to jail for what he “allegedly” did. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_na4AazJ0g">In his own stream</a> responding to the accusations, Mizkif appeared to admit he was controlling of her and said they would get in bad fights but denied the most serious allegations of misconduct.</p> <p>OTK <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293">later announced</a> that it stood by Emiru’s claims and that it previously terminated its relationship with Mizkif for unrelated reasons, while Mythic Talent Management has reportedly now dropped him for breach of contract and is demanding almost $1 million in fees. Mizkif’s lawsuit claims Emiru’s allegations led OTK to remove all equity he had left in the organization without compensation and is accusing its current (Emiru) and former (Asmongold) members of conspiring against him.</p> <p>“Schunk and Hoyt knew at the time that they published these statements that they were false,” the lawsuit reads. “On belief and information, Schunk and Hoyt knew they stood to benefit from Rinaudo’s ouster from OTK and the associated companies and coordinated the timing of their statements to maximize the injury inflicted to Plaintiffs.”</p> <p>Emiru and Asmongold have not yet publicly commented on the lawsuit. Emiru previously said she was in the process of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1og5bn2/emiru_is_on_the_process_of_filing_a_restraining/">getting a restraining order</a>&nbsp;placed against Mizkif.</p>

		<p>Sci-fi RTS Falling Frontier has been pushed to 2026, development studio Stutter Fox Studios has announced today. This is so the team can focus on implementing the systems properly as they head to develop a demo for Falling Frontier and hit Early Access. This is not the first delay for Final Frontier, having been delayed from 2022 to 2023, and then from 2023 to 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Falling Frontier - Brief Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js-opGjTlX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While there has been a delay for Final Frontier, Stutter Fox Studios has been working on various systems as it ventures on its journey to bring the game to the public. The first port of call is the art of Falling Frontier, where the team has developed a shared colour language for ships so players can see understand their function at a glance, while also allowing for designs that reflect the factions the ships belong to. The combat system has been changed from arcade to more of a simulation with ships being able to fire thousands of rounds each minute, and when ships break apart you can see the individual decks within them. Explosions and destruction will be physics based with the team combining &nbsp;volumetric spheres with animated sprite sheets which use motion vectors which allows for a consistent visual flow no matter if you are zoomed in close or watching battles from afar.</p>
<p>Planets have been updated so they are no longer flat textures, with each now being fully 3D worlds populated with ridges, mountains, craters and ravines, and gas planets will have mesh driven volumetric systems. Players will be able to create planets at a later phase of Early Access with the release of the Scenario Editor. In the editor, players will also be able to edit ship colours so players can change the colours of the various factions to their own preferences. There are also pirate ships in the game which can have their own unique designs as well.</p>

<p>The development team has also wrote, <em>“That covers some of the main areas that have seen progress recently. Each part of the project has been about refining what is already there rather than adding more for the sake of it, and that work will continue as we move toward Early Access. If there are areas of development you would like to hear more about, let us know. We will be taking questions from the community to help decide what we cover in future updates, alongside the milestones we reach internally. Thank you to everyone who has continued to follow the project. Your support means a great deal and helps make it possible to bring this world to life the right way.”</em></p>

            <p>
Throughout my time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, I mostly didn't actually miss the first game's not-so-titular Knight. I do love that bug, it's just Hornet made for quite a compelling protagonist (even if I think that the game has a number of issues that go further than just it being potentially unfairly hard). I doubt this will be a universal feeling however, which is where this handy mod where you can once again play as the Knight, but in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, comes into play.
</p>
<p>
The mod, which was originally shared on Github by user <a href="https://github.com/MCXGK3/KnightInSilkSong">MCXGK3</a>, but made available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/745">Nexus Mods</a> if that's your modhub of choice, does what it says on the tin frankly! The description is equally simple: "This is a Mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong. It allows you to control the knight in the game." What else could you possibly need to know? 
</p>
<p>
Well, it's not just an aesthetic change. The mod also brings back the Knight's entire moveset, and you can even equip it with the original game's various charms. It seems quite comprehensive honestly, just keep in mind that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> was not designed around the Knight's playstyle, so that might act as a hindrance.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the mod does have "some things" that can prevent you from getting to Act 3, "or even completing the game," so do take that into consideration too. There's also some bugs - like, the kind that make the game run bad, not the ones you'll be befriending or killing - meaning this mod might be one you want to miss if you want a smooth experience, or if you're playing for the first time. Still sounds better than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">all those horny Hornet mods</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So let’s say it’s a Tuesday night, you’ve got an hour-ish to kill, and you have a copy of <i>Arc Raiders</i>. In a game with menu-heavy navigation, a deep crafting system, and of course the ever-present threat of dying unexpectedly and losing all of your stuff, you might wonder just how much you can get done, especially if you’re a solo player.</p> <p>Well, friends, I decided to document just such a scenario. On a recent Tuesday night (last night, in fact), I jumped in for about an hour and fifteen minutes of my time in <i>Arc Raiders</i> to get a sense of what this game looks like when you’re not mainlining it for tens of hours straight (my first run at the full game was a virtually uninterrupted 20-hour session). Also, as I mentioned, I ran solo last night. <i>Arc Raiders</i> is perfectly solo-able, so long as you’re willing to play a bit more stealthily. So let’s jump into what you can expect in <i>Arc Raiders</i> with about an hour or so of your time.</p>

 <p>First, let’s set some expectations. I’m about 53 hours into <i>Arc Raiders</i>. I’ve built up every crafting workshop, leveling some of them up to level two, and my Raider was at level 38 when I fired the game up, so I’ve progressed up the skill trees a fair bit. This is what my skill tree looked like as of last night:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641438"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641438">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>My first quest: Finding Rope; my first obstacle: My overflowing Stash</h2> <p>I’ve done a substantial number of quests in the game thus far. They’re all pretty much the same thing: Go somewhere, find a key location or object, flip a switch or gather a specific amount of materials, then head out. Hardly riveting subject material, but in a game this open-ended, you really just need some points to go to for random emergent opportunities to present themselves.</p>

 <p>I was tackling the “Eyes In The Sky” quest, for which I’d already completed two out of the three simple objectives: Go somewhere specific on three different maps and install LiDAR Scanners. Fortunately, those LiDAR scanners aren’t actual inventory items I need to manage. I just need to go to a spot and hold down the E key.</p>

 <p>But there was a problem: My final objective required me to build a zipline, which needs <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rope">Rope</a> and for whatever friggin’ reason, I haven’t come across much Rope lately.</p> <p>I’ve also been avoiding going on Night Raids, which see any given map set at night with fewer extraction points, and the promise of better loot.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>My first impulse was to just grab the Free Loadout. As I mentioned <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">in my beginner tips</a>, the Free Loadout is a perfect way to dust yourself off from a defeat or, in my case last night, warm up a bit without the concern of losing some precious gear. But like when a loose thread on your sweater gets caught on something, <i>Arc Raiders</i> said “not so fast.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641439"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641439">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yes, my Stash was full. This is a topic I’ve seen discussed a fair number of times over on the game’s subreddit and here and there in the official Discord. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1on8lst/psa_if_your_stash_is_always_full/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Hoarders don’t have it easy in this game</a>. Keep in mind, I’ve expanded the storage of my Stash several times by spending the game’s non-premium currency (which you can just sell random items to earn). Still, the game wouldn’t let me go out with a Free Loadout because that would give me more items than I have space for.</p>   <p>It’s frustrating, but the game basically said “girl, use the stuff you already have!” The important takeaway is this: item management is a core part of this game and you should expect to dedicate a solid chunk of time to flipping through different menus,&nbsp; sorting and making the most of what you have.</p> <p>And so I did. After trying to clear space (I spent about five minutes trying to rummage through stuff to see what I could use or get rid of), I just rolled out with what I had which included:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Tactical_Mk._2">Tactical Mk. 2 augment</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Medium_Shield">Medium Shield</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Burletta">Burletta IV</a> with a <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Compensator_I">Compensator I</a> and an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Extended_Light_Mag_II">Extended Light Mag II</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Ferro">Ferro IV</a> with a Compensator I, <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Angled_Grip_I">Angled Grip I</a>, and a <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Stable_Stock_I">Stable Stock I</a></li> </ul> <figure id="attachment_2000641440" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641440"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641440">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Add in a bunch of gadgets (more than I likely needed, but I also needed an excuse to use the stuff I’d crafted, lest my Stash will always be full), and I was good to go.</p> <p>I loaded into Spaceport at night with about 29:30 on the clock and one goal in mind: Find Rope. Is a Night Raid a little overkill for such a simple item? Maybe. But I was curious to see what would be available at night.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641441"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641441">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turns out, the more minor POIs (the ones not surrounded by a yellow or red line on the map) were a little sparse. Loot or not, each area posed a challenge to my attention and awareness: I had to constantly ask myself whether a random sound I heard was a sign someone was nearby, possibly even sneaking up on me. I cautiously crawled through various buildings and eventually found my Rope. But then I ran into a tricky situation.</p>

 <h2>I just wanted Rope, now I’m running for my life</h2> <p>I took my time on the map. I was playing it safe. At night, with the world lit by sterile moonlight, it was very easy to see other people from a distance in open areas. In fact, I could see a few other Raiders far out on my perimeter. Every time I stopped to soak in the ambience, manage my loot, or observe an interesting potential sightline, however, I was reminded I was on borrowed time. Gunfire in the near distance meant I had to get moving. Fired shots means someone’s fighting to stay alive, and that’s a situation which could rope me in or result in collateral damage.</p> <p>But more than anything else, I had to get moving because I was running out of time. I’d placed the marker for the extraction point incorrectly on my map (silly me). Now I was trying to split my attention between staying out of sight and making decent time in my trip to extraction and before I knew it, I was on top of a building with just a minute-thirty left of game time (if you don’t extract in time, you die and lose everything). So I had to make a split-second decision: Do I risk jumping off the building? I wasn’t sure I’d even survive, and if I did, I might be left vulnerable to attacks from drones or other players.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641482">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I took the leap of faith, which cost me about 70 percent of my health. I patched myself up quickly and <i>raced</i> to the extraction point, calling in the elevator with 20 seconds left on the clock while an explosion went off right near me and <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rocketeer">a Rocketeer</a> hovered ominously nearby. Was it going to start something with me? I wasn’t sure. The clock ran out, but luck was with me, as it seems there’s a roughly 20-30 second grace period if you’ve called in the elevator.</p>

 <p>I made it out with a bag full of supplies including my Rope.</p> <h2>Finishing the quest</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641458"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641458">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I did some more inventory management and loaded out to Buried City to finish the quest requiring the Zipline. This match included some tense battles with Arc machines and a spooky encounter with another player who wouldn’t communicate. I saw them through a slit in the wall but despite my attempts to say hi and ask them not to shoot, they were noncommunicative.</p> <p>I pushed forward on the quest, always watching my back for that other player. I didn’t know what they were up to, but if it wasn’t good, they were about to find out how good my battle rifle was. Or maybe I’d find out how much better their gun was. Who can say? That tension loomed over me for the rest of the quest.</p> <p>I did some more looting, covering my tracks with traps in case that other player turned out to be stalking me. Once again, I made it out with a sizeable bag of loot and had enough time for one more match. I was just shy of hitting a new level, so I hopped back in.</p> <h2>‘Don’t mess with me’</h2> <p>I loaded back into the same map as I had two new quests to take on. But within a few moments of deploying onto the field, some rando started firing at me.</p>

 <p>“Buddy,” I said out loud, “you don’t want to do this.” At this point I swapped out my Ferro IV for an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Arpeggio">Arpeggio IV</a> (by the way, “Arpeggio” is a perfect name for a three-round burst weapon as three notes played in succession are the minimum you need to play an arpeggio on an instrument properly). It was fitted with a Muzzle Break and an improved magazine capacity. That meant my recoil was sufficiently under control and I had ammo to spare in any firefight.</p> <p>So while this fellow was assaulting me with what sounded like an underpowered gun compared to mine, I audibly said “don’t mess with me,” spun around and took them down with 10 quick pulls of the trigger. They were down but had nothing of value on them, which I’d expected.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641462">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Hey, I warned them!</p> <p>I encountered another player while scouting the locations of my quests. This person didn’t open fire on me, but they also weren’t communicative. In <i>Arc Raiders</i>, the emote wheel is sufficient enough to establish some kind of truce. “Hey,” and “Don’t Shoot” are things any player can communicate with a few button presses.</p> <p>We teamed up silently, doing a bit of basic looting. My bag was full, so I took to watching over my “friend” both because they might need the help and, well, I wanted to make sure they remained “my friend” by never taking my eyes off of them. I did, however, gift them my Burletta as I had enough in my arsenal anyway.</p>

 <p>We came across an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/ARC_Surveyor">Arc Surveyor</a>. These little rolly things move fast and have a lot of armor. Kill them, though, and you’re bound to get some decent loot. We chased this thing around the map for a while before I landed the killing shot. We grabbed what we found and headed for extraction.</p> <p>The extraction point was near the pharmacy, so I decided to let my comrade leave the map while I did once last pass for possible decent loot. There were four minutes left and, hey, I found <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rocketeer_Driver">a Rocketeer Driver</a>! These things can’t be used for offensive attacks, but they are an important crafting ingredient I needed to expand one of my workshops. I snagged it, raced on to the extraction point and got out, hitting level 39 in the process.</p> <p>While I didn’t end up finishing my quests, I did get a good sense of where those objectives were, so I don’t have to waste too much time finding out where I need to go and what I need to gather the next time I load into the game.</p> <p>And so my hour dedicated to <i>Arc Raiders</i> on this specific evening reached its close. I was overtime, in fact, by about 15 minutes. I purchased a new skill in the Mobility Tree, did a bit more inventory management, and that was my evening.</p>

 <hr> <p>My hour with <i>Arc Raiders</i> included some tense shootouts with enemy AI, a few encounters with other players that could’ve ended any which way, a single encounter with someone trying to push their luck, and a whole lot of loot to help me go on better runs.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641461"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641461">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Stealth, tests of aiming, managing my time on the map, all of these are things I’ve loved in other third-person shooters, especially games like <i>The Last of Us</i> and any given <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. But what I loved the most about this hour spent was how organic and spontaneous everything was. I now have a better sense of what loot is where, and can plan future missions accordingly. Plus, I got a better sense of how I can rely on my weaponry. I now know from experience how efficiently that Arpeggio IV works with the equipment I’d chosen to put on it. And if I die to someone and they take that gun, that gun becomes a part of their story; it could even end up being used against me. I don’t want that to happen.</p> <p>I think had I not been running solo, there might’ve been less stealth and I would’ve felt more comfortable about exploring the more dangerous areas of the map, which do promise greater loot. But either way, in an hour, I made some great progress on my weapon builds, unlocked a new ability, finished a quest, and had some interesting encounters with players and enemy AI. I’d say that’s time well spent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes mapping every real-world struggle onto whatever the current pop culture hotness is can feel exhaustingly cynical. Often this tendency manifests in statements and gestures that are, at their best, a bumper sticker tagline about how Republicans are a bunch of Dementors from </span><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i><span>, or at worst, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>literal fascist propaganda dressed in </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>’s imagery</span></a><span>. Even just yesterday, as we headed into election night, the official </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@democrats/video/7568872873331297549?lang=en"><span>social media accounts of the Democratic party</span></a><span> were using </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>my favorite song from </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>to paint </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> as an agent of the evil, soul-eating demon Gwi-ma, and it gave me the ick. So when something like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>actually seems to understand the moment in a deeper, more authentic way, it’s not only a welcome surprise, but it can be an incredibly poignant reminder that not all these stories are empty posturing.</span></p>  <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><span>my </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> review</span></a><span>, I mentioned a moment that made me put my controller down and just stare at the ceiling, speechless and overcome with emotion. It was, admittedly, an inopportune time for me to have to take a break, as Lumiose City, the Paris-inspired metropolis that is the setting for the entire game’s adventure, was facing an apocalyptic threat in the form of a sentient rogue machine called Ange embedded in the city’s central tower. But I just needed a moment. I’m a sentimental person, and pretty much no other series activates all those flowery feelings in me like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>does. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is especially well-equipped to invoke them, and its finale had its sights set on me like a Gigantamaxed Intellion aiming down its scope.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s singular setting has been a point of contention for some </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans. The series is typically defined by its regional pilgrimages that take the player through different cities and biomes in search of its many magical monsters, so putting an entire 30+ hour campaign in one city was already a big change. This isn’t helped by the fact that the map is kind of small and lacks the distinct districts that usually characterize a city. So, looking at it strictly as a video game setting, Lumiose City leaves a lot to be desired. However, what it does manage to capture better than probably any other game in the franchise is that a city is not just a place, it’s a people. Landmarks and attractions can lure anyone to a place like Lumiose for a visit, but it’s the citizens who make a city what it is.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641435">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Because </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is set in one place, it’s better at cultivating a cast of characters than most </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games get to be. Typically, you meet other trainers and gym leaders for a battle or two before you head out on your way to your next destination, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s not-gym-leaders round out a team of absolute weirdos who would likely not interact at all in another </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game. They come from different industries, backgrounds, and cultures, and you could imagine each of them as a figurehead of separate towns with their own eclectic visual motifs. Maybe Canari, the star streamer of Lumiose, and Jacinthe, the battle-obsessed socialite, could have passed by each other at a Kalos gala, but broadly, I can’t imagine most of these guys even being friends if it weren’t for their proximity, both geographically and to you, the player. You serve as the social glue linking a dozen or so disparate trainers that make a full-blown community by the time the game is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>Living in a dense city is pretty much living on top of people whom you might have otherwise never met. From the outside looking in, a place like Lumiose can seem like a chaotic rat race of people too distracted by their own bullshit to care about the person they see every morning on their commute. In </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, however, you see just how untrue that city stereotype is through characters like Corbeau, the leader of the Rust Syndicate, which is essentially </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>version of a French mob. He leads as an intimidating force who is seemingly extorting people like the player’s friend Taunie/Urbain, though as your team works off your debt, you’re not getting involved in heinous crimes, but instead in what is essentially forced public service, like helping the locals deal with problems in their homes or chasing off </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><span>public menaces who are bothering local kids</span></a><span>. When he finally “forgives” your debt, he does so in a roundabout way by staying at your team’s hotel base of operations and leaving a “tip” of the remaining amount. Despite his scary demeanor, the guy’s a household name in Lumiose for wanting to do right by the people.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637236"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637236">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These kinds of on-the-ground institutions rise over the years as corporate interests creep into a city and threaten to overtake it. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>grapples with the impact of this kind of corporate involvement throughout its main story, as the city’s new urban redevelopment plan to bring Pokémon and people together via new Wild Zones that house untamed monsters is orchestrated by a corporation called Quasartico Inc.&nbsp; The company enters the city ostensibly with good intentions, but the people of Lumiose don’t seem satisfied with this arrangement, and the ongoing destabilization of the city as new Wild Zones open begins to interfere with the people’s daily lives. By the time </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>wraps up its main campaign, no one’s really sure if the city is going in the right direction, and there’s something really fascinating about watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe grapple with the world it’s made, even if it doesn’t come to a definitive conclusion by the end of the story.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even within the language of an all-ages franchise, the seedier side of city living lingers over Lumiose. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has anti-homeless benches scattered around its city, includes a few questlines that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shuppet-quest-cop-police-officer-2000640501"><span>criticize the overbearing local police force</span></a><span>, and as the urban redevelopment plan unfolds, the citizens are either complaining about it or straight-up protesting it. The people are watching their city be gentrified, and they feel like they’re being pushed out by a corporation’s supposedly well-meaning changes. This is put on display by two characters, Grisham and Griselle, who were previously unnamed grunts for Team Flare in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, but have stayed in the city and evaded capture, despite their actions in the 3DS games. Nowadays, they run a cafe in the city, but they secretly consider themselves members of “Team Flare Nouveau,” a new iteration of the team that wants to make Lumiose better for the people in it, and they think they’re far more equipped to do so than the suits of Quasartico because they talk to the average citizen every day when they bring them one of their specialty coffees.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641436"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641436">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the most effective segments in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>occurs when these two take you to the old remnants of their base from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, lamenting that they’ve been ostracized from the community of Lumiose, but also have nowhere else to go because this is their home. Rather than simply rehashing the Team Flare story in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, Game Freak chose to turn a remnant of one of its more forgettable villainous teams into a sad, moving echo of ordinary people being swayed by big promises their leaders make and fail to deliver on, typically in pursuit of their own selfish goals. Grisham and Griselle were sold a vision of a world that would help the Kalos region, and instead, all they got was a madman at its helm. So what are they to do? Make the most of it for the city they love.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the people you team up with in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s final hours shouldn’t be friends. In a lot of places in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world, they likely would have never even met. So when the going gets tough and they band together, it shows that the heart of a city is the people who helped build it brick by brick. When it all goes to hell, these unlikely allies all gather around a giant piece of rubble to bicker and strategize how to defend their home. Everyone has something to contribute. Tarragon and his construction crew build a massive path with scaffolding to help you reach your objective, Jacinthe blocks the Rogue Pokemon attacking the city with her barrier tech, and Corbeau uses the might of the Rust Syndicate to…create a human ladder for you to climb (it’s actually a hilarious moment). Lastly, the leaders of Team Flare Nouveau defend you as you try to reach Zygarde, knowing that even if the people of Lumiose can’t forgive them for what they did all those years ago, they’ll protect the city or die trying.</span></p> <p><span>The only way that the people of Lumiose City can overcome this gargantuan threat is together, and god, it hits. It’s why I had to take a breather to just reflect. I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791"><span>moved to New York City to write for </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>almost three years ago</span></a><span>, and as a queer man who grew up in the Bible Belt, there’s something disorienting about notions of community to me. I came from a place where most of the citizens would only rally around you if you checked specific boxes, and if you accepted that help under certain pretenses. Mutual aid often felt like it was conditional, and it often came with strings attached. I know if I asked a lot of the predominantly white, conservative people in that small town, they would say that wasn’t their experience. But many of them were so embedded in their insular circles that they didn’t recognize their hands weren’t extended equally if you were even slightly outside of their bounds.</span></p>

  <p><span>Last night, I attended my first election watch party since moving to the city, and after throwing my support behind new NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, I had been grinding my teeth all day in anticipation of the results. The event was full of so many people from different walks of life, with histories different but perhaps not too dissimilar from mine. Everyone was united in a common cause: to try and make the city more affordable for working-class people after years of escalating expenses pricing people out. In my 33 years, it was the first time I sat in a room waiting for an election result surrounded by people who all wanted the same things I did, and who did more than simply tolerate each other. When Mamdani’s victory was called, he gave an incredible speech that not only promised a future worth fighting for, but asserted that anyone who sought to disrupt that future, even Donald Trump’s fascist administration, would have to go through everyone in New York City. I was standing with my friends, many of whom had only come into my life after I’d uprooted it to be in this city, as we hooped, hollered, and cried, knowing that maybe, just maybe, things might be different tomorrow than they felt today.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I know that </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s depiction of people who love their city coming together for the common good is possible because I’ve seen it. For a lot of my life, I’d felt like stories of disparate people coming together were purely idyllic or naive. But these days, I know better, because those stories are all around me.</span></p>

One quest called Root of the Matter tasks you with visiting the Research Building to find a seed vault. If you've arrived in the building and want to know where to find the seed vault, we'll cover the bases for you in this guide.</p><p>Note that you won't need to extract to complete this quest. Because of this--and given how dangerous the Research Building and surrounding areas can be to explore--we'd recommend bringing a free loadout unless you're feeling particularly confident in your survival skills.</p><p>When you're ready to find the seed vault and wrap up Root of the Matter, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the seed vault in the room with a great view</h2><p>Your first objective in Root of the Matter is to head to the Research Building. This building is located to the right of Marano Park and is a very popular and chaotic area to explore. It's often overflowing with other raiders eager to pick fights, as well as a variety of ARC both inside and outside. Be especially aware of approaching from the Marano Park side, as there are often large ARC patrolling within the square.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597319" data-ratio="0.56327160493827" data-width="1944" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597319"></a><figcaption>Research Building</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Research Building, search for the "room with a great view," which is on the west side of the building with a massive window overlooking the park. In here, you can find the seed vault, which is a cylindrical container against the wall. Interact with it to secure the seeds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597320" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597320"></a><figcaption>Here's where you'll find the seed vault.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg"></figure><p>Now that the quest is complete, you can continue looting or fighting to your heart's content. You don't need to extract for the quest to count, but if you decide you want to get out alive (as you should), the Northern Station is nearby to the northwest of the Research Building, offering a place for a clean getaway. Just be careful heading down the steps, as the train stations in Buried City often house Pod ARCs that will explode when you get near them.

		<p>Chief Rebel is going to be releasing a major patch for Fellowship on November 7th, which will take the game offline from 7am CET. This major patch is going change item levels that are needed to join the different leagues. In addition, some heroes, weapons, and items are going to be rebalanced, and new Active Ability Timers are being added for various abilities.</p>

<h2>Fellowship update patch notes November 6th</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue causing enemies to sometimes desync on their patrol paths – making them invisible to players until they suddenly appeared on top of them. This should resolve the most common situations that caused enemies to become “invisible”.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where “Targeted ground abilities” would sometimes cause the aiming circle to disappear or get centered on your character when the cursor was pointing at a wall or steep slope.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Matchmaking item level requirement adjustments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Adept to 80 (was 60).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Champion to 130 (was 120).<wbr></p>

		<p>Unbeatable is not going to be releasing on November 6th as planned, D-CELL Games have announced just hours before the expected release. The reason for this last moment delay of Unbeatable is the fact that the team ran into a bug that essentially makes the game unreleasable, and it needs to be fixed, which in turn pushes back dates for console certification. The new date chosen is December 9th with that date being chosen as there are fewer other releases around then.</p>
<p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: FINAL TRAILER " width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vkvi71znX_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post on Steam, developer RJ Lake wrote, <em>“Hi! UNBEATABLE was supposed to come out tomorrow! That’s a scary sentence. Here’s a worse one: UNBEATABLE will now release on December 9.I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different… the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made).&nbsp; We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and&nbsp;not&nbsp;fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it…We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody. Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a&nbsp;lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.”</em></p>

<p>In Unbeatable you play as Beat, who makes music with her band. The issue is that music is illegal in the world of Unbeatable, so Beat and the crew are on the run. The gameplay is that of a rhythm action game and completing quests while playing music. The story is said to last around 6 to 8 hours, and there will also be an arcade mode which has its own progression system, modifiers, and challenges to beat. The arcade mode will also get additional songs in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-president-says-movies-and-the-like-are-%E2%80%98very-well-suited%E2%80%99-to-nintendo-games.1344994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As usual following <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Nintendo quarterly report</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa and 'Fellow' Shigeru Miyamoto (the man behind Zelda, Mario, Donkey Kong, and other Nintendo classics) <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered a series of questions fielded in Japanese by investors</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about the company's growing efforts in film and visual media, Shuntaro Furukawa said that movies are 'very well-suited' to Nintendo games. </p>



<p><em>Following the success of "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," I feel that film and visual media are a form of entertainment very well-suited to our games, and we can make unique proposals in this area as Nintendo. As stated in the earlier presentation, this is a field we aim to actively pursue. Through movies and videos, we want to increase our fanbase, spark renewed interest in our games, and build multigenerational support for Nintendo.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, movies are about story and characters, and the Big N has never really managed to shine as much as Sony in these areas. That said, despite his lack of depth, Mario is still arguably the most popular game character, which paid dividends for <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023's record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Its follow-up, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, is slated to air in theaters <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on April 3, 2026</a>, but the most interesting test will be the upcoming Legend of Zelda live action film, starring Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. While still very popular among gamers, the franchise lacks the same level of mainstream recognition as Mario, and how well it can capture an audience remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Miyamoto-san had a much longer response to the same question, pointing out that this is a 'logical next step' for the game developer, and the new internal movie division is focused on experimentation.</p>



<p><em>Nintendo, as an entertainment company, has created a variety of games, IP, and characters. Thinking about entertainment experiences we can maintain long-term, film production became a logical next step. We used to focus on interactivity, but now aim to extend into more passive experiences like film. Film requires people. But we don’t want Nintendo to become a company that just balloons in headcount. Our strategy was to find partners worldwide for joint projects. Content that resonates globally can be made anywhere and speak to anyone—we are investing accordingly. Today, we talk directly and equally with diverse international production teams and creators, and Nintendo’s own developers are involved as well. On the business side, film operates under established structures. If productions are handled well, they generate profit.</em></p>



<p><em>Nintendo Pictures is less about making movies like "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," and more about experimenting with new challenges—making short films, running our own research, and tackling less commercially clear areas. Our short film "Close to you" featuring Pikmin is an example. If these pieces become valuable assets for Nintendo’s content library, we will have succeeded.</em></p>



<p>Earlier today, the Japanese game studio and console manufacturer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed its goal to invest in studio acquisitions</a>.</p>

              <p>America’s most fashionable and fantastic pig, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-muppets-were-always-adult-1724411134">Miss Piggy</a>, is finally getting what she has long deserved: Her very own feature film. It only took those in charge of <em>The Muppets</em> five decades.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/miss-piggy-movie-cole-escola-jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-1236607843/">As spotted by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Jennifer Lawrence recently spilled the beans on a Miss Piggy movie that she and Emma Stone are producing and developing. The news was shared during an interview on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ <em>Las Culturistas </em>podcast<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I don’t know if I can announce this, but I’m just going to. Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie, and [Cole Escola] is writing it,” said <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Hunger Games</em> star Lawrence. The actor didn’t reveal any plot details during the interview, but when asked if she and Stone would appear in the film replied: “I think so, we have to.” Comedian and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Escola">Escola</a> has become a big sensation following the release of their hit Broadway play <em>Oh, Mary!&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Disney and The Jim Henson Company have yet to officially announce the <em>Muppets</em> spin-off movie starring Miss Piggy.</p> <p>If the movie actually happens, it would mark the character’s first solo outing since the famous pig debuted on <em>The Muppet Show</em> back in 1976. The Muppets franchise recently celebrated its 70-year anniversary. And in September, it was announced that Seth Rogen was leading the charge on a new <em>Muppet Show</em> reboot.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/the-muppet-show-disney-plus-seth-rogen-sabrina-carpenter-pilot-1236546510/">Meanwhile, <em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Disney is working on a Sabrina Carpenter-led <em>Muppets</em> special that is set to air in 2026, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original TV show.</p>

The production company A24 has bought the rights to the game and is working with Netflix on an unscripted show, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported.</a></p><p>The show is said to be similar to other Netflix competition series such as Nailed It and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the report said.</p><p>The series is said to be in the "early stages" of development, with multiple developers from Ghost Town Games signed on to be executive producers.</p><p>Overcooked launched in 2016 and was a big success thanks to its local co-op gameplay where people play as chefs in a kitchen. Players must cook meals, serve them, and clean up against the clock, and the action can get heated very quickly. It's not hard to imagine the appeal as a reality TV series. </p><p>A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018, which was followed by Overcooked: All You Can Eat in 2020.</p><p>The Overcooked reality series is just the latest video game project coming to Netflix.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has a multi-quest storyline based around contaminated water, and it all starts with the Water Troubles quest. This quest sends you to the Dam Battlegrounds to collect a water sample--but if you don't know where to do so, it can be a bit confusing to figure out. We'll reduce the frustration for you a bit by explaining how to get the water sample.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete this quest, so feel free to jump in with a free loadout if you prefer. This will ensure that you won't lose anything important if you happen to run into trouble while exploring the Dam Battlegrounds.</p><p>When you're ready to set off, here's how to complete Water Troubles.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_Flood_Access_Tunnel">Where to find the Flood Access Tunnel</h2><p>The first step of Water Troubles requires you to find the Flood Access Tunnel. This is located in the Red Lakes area on the right side of the map. This tunnel is to the right of the Control Tower POI, so you'll either need to approach it on foot from below or make your way down to the Red Lake by sliding or taking a zipline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597281-arcraiders_20251104211416.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597281" data-ratio="0.56010745466756" data-width="1489" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597281-arcraiders_20251104211416.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597281"></a><figcaption>Flood Access Tunnel location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597281-arcraiders_20251104211416.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_intake_to_the_district_s_water_supply">Where to find the intake to the district's water supply</h2><p>When you get to the lower portion of the map, you'll need to spot a massive opening on the side of the concrete wall below the Control Tower POI.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nothing-but-respect-for-this-manual-ear-and-nose-hair-trimmer.1344976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try not to be gross on this site, but if you are a man of about 30 or 40 years old you know that your body just gets weird as you age. If you have met a very old man you will see that the hair in their ear and nose area is often out of control. Generally speaking, products for grooming the nose and ear are badly made, annoyingly loud, and battery powered. The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is none of those things, which is why it is life changing to me.</p><p>Most nose and ear hair trimmers I have used have been battery powered and built like garbage. These things are usually anemic little wands that are way louder than they have any right to be and just take forever at the task of trimming your hairs. The noise is particularly an issue when it comes to your ears, because any motor noise placed directly there becomes borderline dangerous to your hearing. Your other option is plucking, and I can think of few parts of your body that are worse to pluck than your nose hair.</p><figure><figcaption>It comes with a tiny case for travel and a brush for cleaning. </figcaption></figure><p>For a long time I had assumed the solution was more technology, like a quieter motor, but it turns out the opposite was true. The Royal Golden Birdie is a spartan and analog grooming device. It can be used one handed and is meant to be placed between your thumb and index finger. The tip is two interlocking crown shaped prongs that close in on each other when pressure is exerted on both sides. The only noise it makes is a charming metallic rustling sound, like a lower registered version of a barber using shears. It comes apart easily for cleaning; you simply loosen a screw on it and pull the interior layer out to be cleaned with the included brush, which also fits in the case.</p><figure><figcaption>Royal also has a higher end model, but it requires two hands to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Royal makes several models, including a premium one where the brush is stored inside the device, but that one requires using two hands to operate the device itself. I went with the Golden Birdie, which is like five dollars more than the twelve dollar base unit, but I can’t tell what the difference is aside from the golden one claiming to be hypoallergenic. None of these devices cost more than 22 dollars, which is how much money falls out of me like Sonic The Hedgehog every time I leave my house these days.</p><figure><figcaption>Comes apart easily, simple to clean.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike my nasty little Panasonic trimmer, the Golden Birdie just works. With 12 blades, nose and ear hairs just vanish after a handful of delightful little clicks. The Birdie is a joy to use in terms of both its exceeding simplicity and its tactile fidget toy feedback. It gives an otherwise unpleasant grooming task a mild ASMR atmosphere. The Birdie currently has about 11k largely positive reviews on Amazon, so I guess I’m not the only one who really likes this thing.</p><p>I have not put the Golden Birdie through the ringer for more than a few times, and I will concede that it might get shitty over time, but it’s an exceedingly simple device made entirely out of metal with few points of failure (like, say, a motor or battery), and even if it does fail me in the future it costs between a good sandwich and a very good sandwich to replace. That’s the joy when you find a simple solution to an age old problem – there’s just way fewer parts to screw up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Football Manager review, I wrote, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>
