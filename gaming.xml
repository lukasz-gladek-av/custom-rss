            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steve Jackson Games has announced a revival of their Saturday morning cartoon TTRPG. The aptly named <em>Toon Second Edition</em> brings back an updated version of the 1984 original with some welcome modern touches, courtesy of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><h2>The <em>Toon Second Edition</em> Announcement</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/a5976d11-0069-4119-acf2-4d16a54cf8db/landing" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, <em>Toon Second Edition</em> is all about bringing the exaggerated, cartooonish, antics of classic <em>Looney Tunes</em> to a tabletop scenario. It's a game that runs on cartoon logic. No one dies, no matter how many times they are flattened by falling pianos and anvils; they're just temporarily taken out.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Naturally, the game is easy to learn and perfect for families looking for some old-school cartoon slapstick fun. The original release was notable for its tongue-in-cheek tone, parodying the rules and systems of more "serious" role-playing games on the market, like classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The core design of the game even encouraged players to act with wild abandon, with advice like, "Act Before You Think."</p><p>Essentially, anything you can imagine happening during a <em>Looney Tunes</em> short is possible in Toon. The GM, or Animator, changing the environment to engineer cartoonish comeuppance. Characters breaking the fourth wall for the sake of a gag. All of it is here.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> will include new quality-of-life improvements. This includes simplified character designs, enabling faster play, over a dozen customizable cartoon adventures, and improved Silly Tables. For fans of the original, this new rulebook will feature full-color artwork by the original artist, Kyle Miller.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> is designed by Greg Costikyan (<em>Pax Britannica</em>), developed by Warren Spector (<em>Bullwinkle and Rocky Roleplaying Game</em>, <em>The Thing in the Darkness</em>), and revised by Steve Jackson (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Munchkin</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-set-2-kickstarter-is-crowdfunding-critical-success" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Fighting Fantasy</em></a>).</p><p>The Backerkit campaign for <em>Toon Second Edition</em> will go live on December 17, 2025. The campaign will provide PDFs, softcover, and hardcover book options.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105</link>
            <guid>1382284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714"><em>Divinity</em></a> was one of the biggest reveals at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a>. Hell, there was an entire demonic statue sitting in the desert for over a week to get people hyped. Actors were paid to sit in the front row of the showcase and get lifted into the air on pulleys to introduce the game’s first trailer. But what is it and why should you care? Here’s the little we know so far about Larian Studios’ next major RPG.</p> <h2><strong>What is&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It’s a new game from Larian Studios, most famous for the acclaimed 2023 hit RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;Like that one, <em>Divinity</em> is also an RPG. Unlike that one, <em>Divinity</em> takes place in Larian’s own made-up fantasy universe instead of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Forgotten Realms. Larian’s land of Rivellon is still inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves, and so on, though it has some peoples you won’t find in <em>BG3 </em>too, and it still revolves around magic and demonic forces, but there are seven gods and more religious overtones. It started in 2002 with the studio’s first fantasy RPG, <i>Divine Divinity.&nbsp;</i></p>

 <p>“The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.” That’s the tagline for the new <em>Divinity</em>, which Larian promises will be its “most ambitious title yet” and even larger than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">massive statue</a> and a gnarly cinematic trailer that suggests the world of <em>Divinity</em> may be on the verge of succumbing to some truly wicked hellspawn.</p>

  <h2><strong>Wait, is this <em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>No, it ain’t. While fans of that turn-based sub-series would love to see Larian go back to that solid foundation, the company’s head of publishing was very clear that this isn’t a direct sequel. “There aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,” Michael Douse wrote on X <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">prior to <em>Divinity</em>‘s announcement</a>. But Larian did name-check both<em> Original Sin</em> games in its press release, saying fans of those will have a better understanding of this new game’s world.</p>

 <p>Here’s how director Swen Vincke put it in the announcement: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled ‘Divinity.’ We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the <em>Divinity</em> we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.”</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Divinity</em> be turn-based?</h2> <p>That’s one of the great debates raging among fans as <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1999108111789851024"><em>alleged</em> rumors</a> circulate that Divinity&nbsp;<em>might</em> not be turn-based. That would be a big departure from Larian’s last decade of projects which have all been that way. Back in the beginning, however, the <em>Divinity</em> franchise was a real-time action series that played like <em>Diablo</em>. It’s not hard to see Larian going back to that, especially if <em>Divinity</em> is operating on a grander scale than past projects. Maybe it’ll be third-person action more in the vein of modern <em>Dragon Age</em>? Still, the studio has a history of sticking to what works and iterating from there. If I had to bet money, I’d say it’s probably still turn-based.</p>

 <h2>Is that old guy getting <em>Wicker Man’</em>d in the trailer important?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653115"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653115">Larian Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Probably! Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/1pkhj33/they_commited_the_original_sin/">Divinity subreddit</a> have been debating who it might be. One theory is that it’s a character called <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Lucian">Lucian</a> who’s the canonical hero for the original <em>Divine Divinity</em>, eventually getting godly powers and being worshiped. He also adopts a child named <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Damian">Damian</a> who ends up being a vessel for demonic entities. Here’s one fan’s theory:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“The implication of this trailer seems to be that the people of Rivellon stopped worshipping the dead gods and committed, besides the seven deadly sins, the Original Sin of killing the powerless Lucian, which causes the Hellstone to spawn, as the last remnants of the gods and Source were destroyed that way.”</p></blockquote> <p>Much of this interpretation depends on where in the existing timeline the new <em>Divinity</em> takes place. Is it after <em>Original Sin 2</em> or a prequel to the entire franchise? Or maybe somewhere in the middle? Whoever is being tortured in the game’s first trailer, it seems clear that all is not well in Rivellon and the demons are coming to take over.</p> <h2>When is <em>Divinity</em> coming out?</h2> <p>There’s no release date yet. Not even a release window or a whisper of one. <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> was made in three years. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> took six. A lot will depend on whether this is the only game Larian has in production or it’s working on something else alongside it. Either way, we probably won’t see it out in the wild until 2027 or beyond.</p> <h2>What platforms will <em>Divinity</em> launch on?</h2> <p>PC seems like a safe bet. Maybe even an Early Access launch like Larian did with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It could be far enough away to be a cross-gen console release on both PlayStation 5 and PS6. Same for Xbox. Hopefully it runs well on PC handhelds and Valve’s Steam Machine. Maybe it’ll even come to Switch 2? Larian’s only other game to launch on a Nintendo platform was <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>.</p>

            <guid>1382281</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> has officially been named Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025, alongside multiple other wins. If that winning sweep has you jumping in for the first time (or returning for another playthrough), IGN has you covered with guides, explainers, and wikis to help you get started for your journey across The Continent.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33? Should You Play It?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG (it's kind of like Final Fantasy VII... <em>kind of</em>) set in the world of The Continent. It follows a group called Expedition 33 on a mission to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious figure who wipes out anyone over a certain age in a yearly ceremony called the "Gommage." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside extremely unique turn-based combat, which emphasizes various skills and parries to deal damage to bosses with "tells" and plenty of secret weak points, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Characters"><strong>you and your party</strong></a> explore various different areas, encountering enemies, finding treasure, and discovering what happened to other Expeditions that ventured out to beat the Paintress - and failed - before. You also can also build your team to deal ridiculous combo-based damage, something that hardcore players have come to love about Expedition 33. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're an RPG fan but don't have time to sink 100+ hours into them, Expedition 33 may be <em>perfect</em> for you. If you solely focus on the main story, you can expect to roll credits in around 28 hours. With side quests, this increases to 45 hours. If you're set on completing <em>everything</em>, it'll take roughly 65 hours. And if you want to beat a bunch of optional bosses with crazy builds, you can do that, too. Oh and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">we gave Expedition 33 a great score in our review </a>if you want a more in-depth take!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/23/doesnt-tell-you-site-1745450875713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">How Combat Works in Expedition 33</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned previously, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 features turn-based combat, which means that everyone in battle, including enemies, attacks one at a time, rather than everyone at once - think classic Final Fantasy, Persona, or Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't just wait for enemy attacks to hit you, though. Here, one of the main selling points is the ability to parry, dodge, and jump to avoid and counter attacks. When an opponent uses a move, you're able to press a button that, when timed right, either dodges, jumps, or parries to avoid damage completely or deal damage back to them. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/expedition-33-combar-1765568222438.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to your own skills, these are powered by Pictos and Luminas. Pictos are special pieces of equipment that you equip to characters to grant special benefits and increase stats. Luminas, working hand-in-hand with Pictos, are special skills that unlock after you've won a battle with a Picto four times, and can be carried over and used with every member of your party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Builds are a crucial part of combat in Expedition 33, and you'll need to pay mind to not only your Pictos and Luminas, but weapons and attributes.

It is essentially the postgame that </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> lacked when it launched in October, and while your mileage may vary on whether or not you want to spend an extra $30 to play it, what’s here is a compelling spin on everything that made the game one of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> most compelling experiments.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is set after the events of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, so you’ll have to see the credits (the real ones, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>not the fake ones</span></a><span>) to dive in. A young girl named Ansha shows up in Lumiose City to ask for Team MZ’s help. She’s in search of a powerful legendary Pokémon to give to her mother as a present. Because we’re heroes who never turn away a person in need, we agree to help her find this mystery beast, but before we can really start looking, the city is overtaken by mysterious portals that lead to a bizarro version of Lumiose called Hyperspace. In this mirrored universe, we find Pokémon that aren’t native to the city and are more powerful than they’re supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The only way we can face these powerful foes and investigate this odd phenomenon is by Ansha feeding her partner Pokémon Hoopa berry-filled Donuts that allow it to power up our Pokémon as we head into Hyperspace on short expeditions. All of this paves the way for an interesting, albeit slightly underbaked (ironic, considering the whole Donut gimmick) roguelike mode that puts all your battle knowledge to the test.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653108">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t quite introduce a complete mechanical overhaul of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s real-time battle system, but it is far more demanding. Each time you head into Hyperspace, you’re on a timer whose length is determined by the quality of the Donut you make for Hoopa, which also increases your stats and raises your level beyond the typical cap of 100. You only have so much time to complete a few missions to gather intel points, and learning how best to make the most of your limited time can be the difference between a lucrative run or a wasted one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into this mirrored version of Lumiose can last anywhere from a few minutes to almost 10, depending on the recipe Ansha cooks up, all determined by the Berries you bring her. Once you’re in Hyperspace, you’ve gotta make quick choices about what enemies you fight, which objectives you focus on, and the Pokémon you bring and use with you. Even your most powerful monster might waste some of your time because its moves take too long to charge up, and the clock won’t stop ticking as long as the game is unpaused.</span></p>

 <p><span>Getting a hang of the whole system can take some time, especially when the early expeditions you take into Hyperspace give you just a scant few minutes to acclimate yourself to the ways in which you must change how you carry yourself in this hostile new environment. By the time I was making Donuts that gave me more minutes on the clock, I had a strategy in place that I would adapt on the fly. I’d lead with a Pokémon equipped to handle a rift’s assigned element, barrel through the mini-quests I was assigned for that route, then head to high ground to find the Bonus Ball treasure chest that would spawn after I’d completed my tasks. I’d use my Salamence to search for this item, because his flight ability meant he could get to this golden ball from just about anywhere, helping me snag it within whatever precious seconds I had left in a run.</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into Hyperspace made me more aware of some of the weaknesses of my party’s composition. I didn’t trade out Pokémon, but as the time limit ticked down in these sections, I became more aware of how slow my Houndoom’s Dark Pulse charge-up was and the time I could save by swapping it out for a faster Crunch attack. My Raichu is spec’d as a physical attacker, but only one of those attacks can reach targets in the air. By the time I was really trying to min-max every Hyperspace run, I had changed several of my go-to movesets just to accommodate the ever-present threat of being yanked out of Hyperspace. Fast attacks that could reach targets above eye level were more important than heavy-hitting ones that would take precious seconds to cast.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653109">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s roguelike elements are a bit shallow, with your success mostly determined by how far past the level cap you are when you enter Hyperspace, the time limit and focus on verticality do require you to rethink what efficiency looks like in a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, and ideally, you think of those things before you head into the imaginary city with level 140 monsters.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble I expect some folks to have with the roguelike half of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is that it is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>huge grind</span></a><span>. I hit the credits at about a dozen hours, and large chunks of that time were spent going in and out of Hyperspace to gather intel for folks back home to research the cause of this phenomenon before it engulfed the entire real city. I don’t mind it personally, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system has always felt more like a puzzle game to me than a grindy RPG. I like seeing a Pokémon in the distance, choosing who in my party can most likely take it out the fastest, and seeing if I can pull it off. The grind started to hit me hardest in the endgame as I tried to capture some of the major Legendary monsters in the DLC, and even as I chip away at some of the post-game stuff, I’m still feeling that. But I still enjoy </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system enough that the grind’s not a detriment for me.</span></p> <p><span>If all </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>had to offer were the roguelike elements, however, I wouldn’t be that hot on it. Thankfully, there’s also a bevy of new quests full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>funny citizens saying silly things</span></a><span>, stories to hear, and monsters to catch. Over 100 returning Pokémon from regions far beyond Kalos appear in Hyperspace, and that includes a ton of new Mega Evolutions as well. As anyone who has paid attention to me yelling about it on </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>for months will know, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>added two Mega Evolutions to my favorite guy, Raichu. I was a mark ready to slap down $30 to finally see my boy get some love, and the X form’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Superman-like fighting style</span></a><span> makes him one of my favorite Mega Evolutions Game Freak has ever put out. But Raichu is just one of several Megas added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, and there are some inspired choices. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s base-game Megas skewed a bit too silly for some folks’ liking, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>definitely tips the scales in the opposite direction with a ton of “cooler” designs. I won’t spoil some of the monsters Game Freak decided to give a new form to, but suffice it to say that I was really eager to see each new form when I finally came to face them.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of those Megas are especially memorable because </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>brings back the best part of the base game with Rogue Mega Evolution battles. These lengthy boss fights against rabid Mega Evolutions are still some of the most entertaining skill checks in probably any </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game, and they’re made all the more challenging because they take place in Hyperspace, thus having a time limit and broken level cap to deal with. These frantic fights are tough, require coordination between your player character and Pokémon, and still find ways to surprise me in how the different Rogue Megas behave.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000653107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653107">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the best things </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>adds is the ability to replay these fights, which wasn’t available in the base game. I’ve had a lot of fun going back to some of those fights with Mega Raichu in my party, so he can actually take them on. One of my biggest problems with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was that its focus on Mega Evolution made its party compositions feel more limited, as it was much more difficult to handle some of these fights without Mega-Evolution-capable critters on your team. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t change that, but at least it gives me a chance to play through these fights again with my favorite guy.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is tied up in a story that ties together multiple sides of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. Each of this series’ generations has been set in a different region, and as such, they can feel a bit disconnected from one another. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes a point to spotlight multiple sides of its mythology, so it surprisingly feels like a sequel to games you might not expect. Fans of </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>’s Hoenn region will probably get a kick out of how much it factors into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but there’s something here for fans of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>’s Sinnoh legends, as well.</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Raichu flies around like he’s Superman, and if you don’t think that’s the tightest shit you’ve ever seen, I don’t know how to help you.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Game Freak</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Post-game expansion for Legends: Z-A with more monsters, Megas, and challenges</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Roguelike mode is a new challenge, interesting use of the series’ mythology, Mega Raichu.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>It’s a grind, roguelike elements could be a bit meatier.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~12 hours to credits, still chipping away at post game stuff.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>As much as I loved everything </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>gave me, I understand the $30 price tag is a big ask for folks. I try not to weigh in on the price of things in reviews because I don’t know every reader’s financial situation, and it feels disingenuous of me to try to make some sort of judgment call about whether or not something is “worth” a certain amount of money. Mega Raichu sold me on the expansion before I’d even played it, but looking at the DLC in the context of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> long history, it does feel a little bit icky. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s post-game was practically non-existent, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes the post-game one of the most robust in the series, but it’s on top of an already pricey game in a world where video game prices are only getting more expensive.</span></p> <p><span>I can’t make the call for you on whether it’s “worth” the price, but I can tell you that I got a whole lot more of a game I loved and that spoke to the things I enjoy most about this series. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s greatest strengths are in its experimental battle system and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>city-centric storytelling</span></a><span> that makes the most of its merry band of misfits. I got that in spades here, and I got to see it with a Mega Evolution of my favorite Pokémon by my side.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you didn’t already&nbsp; love </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I would be surprised if anything here changed your mind. I’m having a great time, though. Raichu and I aren’t done scavenging every inch of Hyperspace for the Pokémon we haven’t met yet, and if this is the end of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, it’s still going to be one of my favorite games in the series. </span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Holy crap, <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a> started off with a huge surprise: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>!</em> A spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em> from Casey Hudson and set in the Expanded Universe! Wowza, that’s exciting stuff. Here’s everything we know right now about this upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>What is <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> or as all the cool kids call it, “<em>FOTOR</em>,” is a newly announced single-player<em> Star Wars</em> action RPG that is set in the same era as the beloved <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> games, the less-loved-but-still-good MMO spin-off, and all the various tie-in media. It was revealed during the Game Awards 2025. Here’s the awesome trailer:</p>

  <h2><strong>OMG! Is this <em>Knights of the Old Republic 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>Nope! But <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer">Lucasfilm, Casey Hudson, and Arcanaut Studios have referred to <em>FOTOR</em> as a “spiritual successor”</a> to those games that take place in the same era of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. It also isn’t a turn-based RPG, but it will feature many choices, and the people making it have hinted at players being able to play as either good or bad characters, something that was a big part of <em>KOTOR.</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Wait, who is Casey Hudson?</strong></h2> <p>Hudson was the director behind BioWare’s original <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> and would also help create and lead <em>Mass Effect</em> after <em>KOTOR</em>. His return to <em>Star Wars</em> and the<em> Old Republic</em> franchise is a big reason why people are super excited about this game, and also why so many people think it’s <em>KOTOR 3</em>. (It isn’t, as explained above.)</p>

 <h2><strong>When does<em> Fate of the Old Republic</em> take place?</strong></h2> <p>We don’t really know much about <em>FOTOR’s</em> setting and story yet. The trailer shows off some new characters who will likely be involved in the full game, but Hudson and Lucasfilm are being tight-lipped about any specific details. They did, however, confirm that this isn’t a direct sequel to <em>KOTOR </em>or <em>KOTOR 2.</em> Instead, it will feature a new story, new locations, new characters, and so on. But if I were a betting man, I’d wager some credits that elements, characters, and locations from those past games might show up in some form or another in <em>FOTOR.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Is it canon? Or Legends?</strong></h2> <p>Again, we’ve not been given a clear answer to this question, but I’d be shocked if <em>FOTOR</em> was canon with the films. The<em> <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic#Continuity">Old Republic</a></em> games, books, and comics were all part of the old Expanded Universe, which was made non-canon after Disney bought<em> Star Wars</em> over a decade ago. While some elements of the <em>Old Republic</em> universe <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-rogue-one-easter-eggs-lore-luthen-1849774482">have been made canon</a>, like the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rakatan">Rakatan</a> species, the bulk of the <em>Old Republic</em> is no longer canon.</p>

 <p>But who cares?! The<em> Old Republic</em> MMO has been going strong for years now, telling new Legends stories. I think it’s great, actually, that Lucasfilm seems willing to let more projects be made that aren’t canon, but instead are part of the old EU. That’s a win for everyone in my book. And it lets <em>FOTOR</em> do its own thing without having to twist itself in narrative knots and retcons in order to fit in the canon timeline.</p>

 <h2>Who is making <em>FOTOR</em>?</h2> <p>As mentioned, Casey Hudson is directing, and <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is being developed by Arcanaut Studios, a new company founded by Hudson earlier this year. That actually leads us perfectly into the next question…</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a single player narrative-driven action RPG and spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</p> <p>Working on KOTOR was a defining experience of my career. This is a dream come true for me and our team of incredible… <a href="https://t.co/unx3HvoyUG">pic.twitter.com/unx3HvoyUG</a></p> <p>— Casey Hudson (@CaseyDHudson) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999287887053955250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>When is it coming out?</h2> <p>Oh boy, I’ve got bad news for you: Probably not anytime soon. Remember, Arcanaut Studios was just created earlier this year. That means this game is likely still in pre-production or has just entered development. We are very, <em>very</em> early in the process here, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">as pointed out by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier</a>, <em>FOTOR</em> is almost certainly not a PS5 game and might not be released until 2030.</p> <p>AAA games take a long time to make, and the time to create them is getting longer as games get more complicated and visually impressive. This is also a new studio that is still figuring out its culture, its tools, and learning how to work together. So yeah, the earliest I’d expect <em>Fate of the Republic</em> to launch is late 2028, and that is being extremely hopeful and would likely involve a ton of crunch and support studios. The more reasonable option is 2030 or later. Which, yeah, could mean <em>FOTOR</em> is a late PlayStation 6 game and/or an early PlayStation 7 launch.</p> <h2>What platforms is <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> launching on?</h2> <p>PC almost for sure. Beyond that, no idea. Nothing confirmed, and based on how many years away it will be, likely not PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or Switch 2.</p> <h2>Will I get to use a lightsaber?</h2> <p>Yeah. The trailer basically confirmed that. You need to pay attention more.</p>

              <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> will star in Microsoft’s first gaming showcase of 2026. Rockstar is still claiming fired employees were leaking game secrets. And the anime studio behind <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> is officially no more. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, which is even later than usual today because we’re all hung over from The Game Awards.</p> <p>I apologize. It was a late one. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> went home with almost everything. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> went home with literally nothing. But who’s really keeping track? <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-3%C2%BD-hours-long-17-minutes-of-actual-awards.1381588/">Only 10 percent of the show</a> actually involved people winning awards and making speeches. But some players are still crashing out over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pkhe5x/my_reaction_to_players_voice_i_find_it_funny/">a gacha game winning multiple trophies</a>, including “Player’s Voice.” At least they didn’t get murdered by the <em>Okami</em> social media account. Did Hideki Kamiya forget he was still logged in? Unfortunately for the person involved, it sounds like it was <a href="https://x.com/TheIshikawaRin/status/1999433036941918307">one big misunderstanding</a>.</p>

It’ll include <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. “I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct,” President of Microsoft gaming content Matt Booty <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/">told <em>Variety</em></a>. “But we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.” <em>Fable</em>, <em>Gears: E-Day</em>, <em>Halo Remastered</em>, and more are expected to launch during the 25th anniversary of Xbox.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft admits annualizing <em>Call of Duty</em> is “difficult”</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> has performed poorly enough that Activision hasn’t released any sales metrics and has promised never to release back-to-back franchise sequels again. But Matt Booty isn’t worried.</p> <p>“Shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way,” he told <em>Variety</em>. “And the interesting thing about <em>Call of Duty</em> is, I think that as an IP, it is really well positioned to continue to deliver content for players going forward; the system of seasons. And it’s not just about the launch, but it’s kind of in its own unique category and ability in terms of how the team keeps delivering content throughout the year. So we’re real happy with where we’ve landed with that.”</p>

Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading,” the studio wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">in a new statement to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p> <div> <p dir="ltr">The union representing the fired developers still claims this isn’t true. “Rockstar’s latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation-they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,” the IWGB responded in a new statement of its own. “Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterize workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as ‘leaking information.'”</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Anime powerhouse Gainax officially shut down this week</h2> <p dir="ltr"><em>Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno shared his thoughts about the studio’s troubled collapse. “As someone who has been with the company for over 20 years since its founding and has been involved as a shareholder until today, this is a truly disappointing end, but I am accepting it with a sense of urgency,” he <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/2025/12/11/251211/">wrote</a>. The animation veteran described his view of the company’s demise which included a legal fight with its management, some of whom were once his close friends.</p> <p dir="ltr">Anno continued, “Specifically, upon learning about the various false statements made by former Fukushima Gainax representative Yoshinobu Asao, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and Yasuhiro Takeda, whom I considered friends since college, toward my company and myself, including instructions from then-President Yamaga [who was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gainax-president-arrested-after-taking-nude-photos-of-t-1840227841">arrested in 2019</a>] to Gainax employees to pretend he was hospitalized, statements that viewed our company as hostile, and schemes to unfairly avoid repayment, I have gone beyond anger to sadness.”</p> <div dir="ltr"> <h2>Xbox exclusive<em> South of Midnight</em> moves to Switch 2 and PS5 in the spring</h2> <p>That’s roughly a year <a href="https://x.com/CompulsionGames/status/1999265189204754913">after it launched</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like me, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">still have visions of last night's grotesque trailer for a new Divinity game</a> from Larian Studios burned into your head, then you'll be delighted to know there's already a whirl of fan theories as to what it all meant. Specifically, some fans think they've worked out who the man burned alive inside the wicker man is, or at least, who he's supposed to represent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to <strong>get into some spoilers for basically all the other Divinity games here</strong>, so if you intend to play through some of those in advance, read on at your own risk.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, there are a few possibilities being floated for who that guy in the fire is. The first, and most probably, is Lucian, the human player character of Divine Divinity and a recurring figure throughout the Divinity games. There's a <em>ton</em> of history behind Lucian, but what you probably need to know is that he was at one point worshipped as the "Divine", chosen by the Seven gods of Rivellon. He stands in opposition to a force known as Chaos, the source of Rivellon's demons which seeks to invade and consume Rivellon, but he also at one point adopted a baby named Damian who was known to serve as a vessel for the Lord of Chaos, which goes about as well as you can imagine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucian is also the founder of The Divine Order. If you've played Original Sin 2, you'll remember those guys as the folks rounding up Source users, but also will recall that at the time of the game, Lucian had already passed away...or so everyone thought. The end of the game has you discover him hiding in his tomb, having faked his death and is quietly working to purge the Source from Rivellon entirely. Depending on your actions when you meet him, Lucian might end up dead, or alive and still Divine. Sort of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads to the theories that the guy in the fire is Lucian. In the ending of Original Sin 2 where you allow all the world's Source to be purged, Lucian is reinstalled as Divine ruler. However, unbeknownst to most, he doesn't possess Divine powers anymore. He's just a dude. One theory being floated is that somehow the people of Rivellon have figured out that Lucian is powerless and the gods are dead (you actually kill all seven of the world's gods in Original Sin 2) or otherwise gone. Lucian's committed a lot of pretty atrocious crimes over the years against a lot of people in the name of the greater good, so it's not shocking that folks would be pissed and turn on him as soon as it was clear he had no real power. But even just beyond the lore, look: the guy looks like Lucian!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/lucian-the-divine-1765559833901.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lucian in Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/lucian-statue-1765559833901.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A statue of Lucian from Divinity: Original Sin 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He's the right age, he's got the beard and the bushy eyebrows. He's wearing a crown, suggesting royalty. And most importantly, check out the star-shaped scar on his chest. As pointed out in the Reddit post above, it matches the star on the end of Lucian's staff pretty well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it's not totally certain that this is Lucian. Some other possibilities floated are that this isn't Lucian himself, but an annual ritual where some other guy is tortured and killed as a stand-in for Lucian, who would already be long-dead at the time this is happening. There are other suggestions that this isn't Lucian, but Damian, the kid Lucian adopted. Damian is a vessel for Chaos, so him being executed for that reason and Chaos bursting out of him when he dies would make a lot of sense. And both the Lucian and the Damien theories work with the game's promo text shared yesterday: "The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then we've got folks elsewhere pointing out that the presence of a Blood Rose suggests ties to the former tyrannical Source King, Braccus Rex, who's also theoretically dead by this point but has come back from the dead twice now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's all assuming this game takes place after all the other Divinity games. There are plenty of folks suggesting it takes place somewhere in the middle of the timeline, or even as a precursor (given its name), and others reminding us that Larian's Divinity lore hasn't always been consistent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot to unpack here and it's going to take some serious Divinity lore nerds to understand it all. Or, Larian might just tell us in a few months. Maybe they'll make it easy. If you still want to unpack it a little further, we have an explainer on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3">what exactly we do know about this new Divinity game so far</a>, especially in relation to the kinds of games Larian Studios has made up til now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

And if you still haven't jumped into the story-rich RPG, you can pick it up for just $36 (was $50). No doubt it's an iconic game, and we'd contend it's worth purchasing even at full price--it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's Game of the Year</a>, after all. So at $36, it's hard to pass up.

It doesn't have a traditional fast travel system, but that only means you'll have more time to wander its gigantic open world overflowing with dynamic encounters and side-quests.</p><p>Those waiting for GTA VI can bide their time with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Many+Of+2025%27s+Best+PC+Games+During+Fanatical%27s+Winter+Sale&amp;fnauthor=jbit92&amp;fndate=2025-12-12+07%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-12+11%3A37%3A54&amp;fnarticle_id=6536936&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fsaints-row-gold-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-winter-sale-2025%2F1100-6536936%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Saints Row: Gold Edition</a>, which is a mere $6 (was $40). The off-the-wall crime game isn't quite as well-regarded as the GTA series, but at just $6, it's a solid choice to keep you busy with building a crime empire, kitting out supercars, and blasting your way through hordes of enemies as you take over the sandy city of Santo Ileso.</p><p>Plenty of other great titles are included in Fanatical's Winter Sale 2025, and you'll find a few of our favorites

  <article>
    <p>This week, Gita, Riley, and Chris talk about many games that came out recently that will never win a Game Award, and what our attitudes about the event are.&nbsp;First, the enigmatic Ys-alike <em>Angeline Era</em>, a beautiful game with <a href="https://even-kei.medium.com/divest-from-the-video-games-industry-814a1381092d?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">thoughtful</a> <a href="https://melodicambient.substack.com/p/the-book-of-bumpslash-action-level?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">design</a>. Second, the toe tapping <em>Rhythm Doctor</em> which feels like it takes cues from <em>Rhythm Tengoku</em> and iNIS games like <em>Ouendan</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss <em>Skate Story</em>, Faustian <em>Tony Hawk</em> with an incredible soundtrack that reminds us of <em>Arctic Eggs</em>. We give a shoutout to <em>Demonschool</em>, which has surprisingly good combat. Finally we discuss <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>, the Dark Pac-Man game (announced at The Game Awards) that came out over the summer and has shockingly deep roots in <a href="https://ugsf-series.com/en/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">UGSF lore</a>.</p><p>Lastly, we shout out <em>Nightreign</em> as one of our favorite games of the year and talk about its freaky new characters. We also answer your questions about peppermint treats, the NY game dev scene, AI and more!</p>

<p>As it does every year, The Game Awards made some huge announcements during the 2025 edition. Geoff Keighley stood there and rifled off some big trailers, game reveals, and Insider Gaming has picked out six headline moments.</p>



<p>The annual end-of-year celebration of all things gaming is in the books once more. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> presented nearly 30 awards and showcased many game reveals, new trailers, and much more. Throughout the course of the nearly four-hour show, some segments happened that are sure to live long in the memory.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-the-game-awards-2025-announcements-amp-game-reveals">Best The Game Awards 2025 Announcements &amp; Game Reveals</h2>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Arcanaut Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Who saw this one coming? The Star Wars community has spent years waiting impatiently for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/old-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-images-appear-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>. Reports have gone back and forth on whether the remake is happening, but what everyone does know is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-shockingly-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development</a>. It’s a spiritual successor to KOTOR and promises to capture the essence and magic of why KOTOR is so popular.</p>







<p>The bad news is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely years away from release</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-divinity">Divinity</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Larian Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Larian Studios was quite cunning in the lead-up to TGA 2025. The company proclaimed that there were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no current plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Evidently, this was the case. This didn’t stop the developer from solving the frustrating mystery of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards Statue</a> by announcing Divinity—a new entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>Despite Baldur’s Gate 3’s success, Larian is shifting gears back to the series that launched the company to success. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity announcement</a> certainly was a bombshell.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Plenty of Resident Evil Requiem has been seen already. The game isn’t a secret, and its release date is getting ever closer. So why does it make this list? Confirmation was finally revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Kennedy</a> is one of the two playable characters. Alyssa Ashcroft will handle the survival-horror and puzzle-based sections of gameplay, whereas Leon is an ass-kicking machine.</p>



<p>Over 20 years after we first saw Leon being chased by chainsaw-wielding freaks, it’s fitting that the former RPD officer now gets his own eviscerating machine.</p>

<p>Control 2 has been a constant rumor with even more constant buzz, and TGA 2025 finally revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control: Resonant</a>. Original protagonist Jesse Faden looks to be taking a backseat in Resonant as a new character gets to experience the usual mind-bending chaos associated with the FBC. It looks just as trippy and psychologically challenging as the first title, and Remedy has a certain penchant for infusing the weird with the wondrous.</p>

<p>It’s always a shame when something leaks ahead of time (the irony is not lost here), and news came out before The Game Awards 2025 that two new Tomb Raider games were about to be unveiled. In a shock to no one, this is what happened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Tomb Raider Remake</a> of the first TR game was shown, and we also got wind of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>—a completely brand-new entry in the franchise. There has been nothing on the Lara gaming front since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and now she’s pulling double-duty!</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fuse Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Galactic Racer was revealed at The Game Awards</a>, and the world felt like a better place. Racing games aren’t as frequent and in abundance as they once were, and you’ll have to dust off the cobwebs to find the last Star Wars racing game. Galactic Racer is being made by Fuse Games—comprised of devs who’ve worked on Burnout and Need for Speed games—and this should give everyone…A New Hope.</p>

                <p>From 1999 to 2017, Bruce Straley was one of the key players at Naughty Dog, and the co-director of two its best-selling games, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. However, Straley essentially left the game industry for several years despite that impressive track record. Now, Straley is sharing more details regarding his departure, following up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-reveals-why-he-left-naught/1100-6456223/" data-ref-id="1100-6456223">comments he made years ago</a>.</p><p>"I had been there 18 years. That's a long time for anybody to be anywhere," Straley told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I'm not saying there wouldn't be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine."</p><p>Straley went on to explain that he didn't jump to another AAA studio because he felt Naughty Dog was the "pinnacle" of developers that made the games he was interested in. And he didn't want to deal with "a whole different bureaucratic or cultural system."</p><p>"It really comes down to: Do you want to continue working for someone else and put in all the effort to build an IP, to build characters, to build things that a franchise could be built out of? I got paid very well there," added Straley. "I got some appreciation there, but it felt like it was time to break out and try it on my own. It felt like it was time to evolve my concepts and build a new team. It might fail miserably, but I thought that it was at least my failure based on my choice."</p><p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Straley's new team at Wildflower Interactive debuted their inaugural title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/debut-title-from-last-of-us-and-uncharted-co-director-revealed/1100-6536829/" data-ref-id="1100-6536829">Coven of the Chicken Foot</a>. It's a wordless single-player adventure that's completely unlike the games Straley made at Naughty Dog. Players assume control of a witch named Gertie and her creature companion as they try to fulfill her oath. The game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

Now, every monster that can undergo one of these superpowered transformations can do so in the RPG, including ones that were omitted from the original roster. However, there </span><i><span>is </span></i><span>one of these evolutions that is still missing from the game; you just might not know about it if you haven’t been paying attention to the leaks and datamining communities.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>introduces Z forms for two Pokémon who were already able to Mega Evolve. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>Lucario</span></a><span> and Absol have had standard Megas since the mechanic was introduced in </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, and the DLC adds new ones that change their appearance and give them a special mechanic that lets them speed up their cooldowns at the expense of a prolonged transformation. It seemed odd that Game Freak would create a whole new mechanic for only two monsters, so perhaps it’s not surprising that a third one is in the game’s code, but isn’t obtainable in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Garchomp is apparently the third Z form in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but at the moment, the only traces of it are in datamined models. Fans hypothesize that Game Freak is planning on giving players a new Mega Stone to transform their own dragon/ground beasts into this new form in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mewtwo-mega-evolution-stones-quest-2000649609">an upcoming event</a>. Despite this, dataminers have unearthed the new form’s model, which you can see below:</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="es" dir="ltr">Mega Garchomp Z <a href="https://t.co/iPy8aHPHD8">pic.twitter.com/iPy8aHPHD8</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1998838515866431571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I knew about Garchomp Z from <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">previous leaks</a>, and was surprised I hadn’t seen it after putting over a dozen hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>thus far. I’ve faced new Megas for Legendary and Mythical monsters already, and I know Garchomp is a ferocious beast, but it doesn’t seem like something you’d turn into an endgame battle after players have faced the final boss, so this explanation makes some sense. We’ll see if the Garchomp Z stone is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>as much of a grind</span></a><span> to get as most other things in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> whenever Game Freak releases it.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic Is Likely Years Away From Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/</link>
            <guid>1382128</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the bigger announcements of this year’s The Game Awards was the reveal of a brand-new single-player Star Wars game called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. And while the hype surrounding the new game was understandably strong, a release date for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely still many years away.</p>



<p>In a new interview at <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StarWars.com</a>, it was confirmed that the studio working on the game, Arcanaut Studios, was formed in 2025. </p>







<p>That was followed up with a post on Bluesky on Friday by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, who says that a release date of 2030 could be an “optimistic guess” for the game. It’s important to note, however, that this is his guess and not an official report on it. </p>



<p>As far as why a game would be announced so early on in development, it’s often done as a way to show progress ahead of mass hiring. With tangible proof of the game progressing, it makes hiring an easier task for many development studios. </p>

<p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a single-player player narrative action RPG. It’s also not a direct sequel or continuation of the story. The game is being led by Casey Hudson, the director of the original Knights of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy.</p>







<p><strong>“Blending innovative storytelling, memorable characters, and heart-pounding combat,&nbsp;Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic&nbsp;will immerse you in an unforgettable experience where every decision deepens your journey toward the light…or the darkness,” </strong>Arcanaut said. </p>



<p>The game is still <strong>“in the early stages of development and creation</strong>” and more details on the game will come at a later date.</p>
