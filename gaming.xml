<p>As the battle gets underway in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment</a> this week, it seems the team at Koei Tecmo's AAA Games Studio has already got some future updates planned.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/zelda_musou/status/1986357898071638423">Zelda Musou account on social media</a> has revealed how the developer is apparently gearing up to release two free updates in the future, which will allow fans of the new title to enjoy the experience "for even longer".</p>
<p>We don't have the specifics about these updates just yet, but we'll let you know when the details are revealed and they go live. This announcement follows the first patch for the new entry this week, which fixed some issues and also added a new shortcut feature to the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2rogjnh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it, there's also some bonus content you can unlock right now in Age of Imprisonment if you have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> save data.

<p>If you've not yet decided whether or not to check this new entry out, be sure to check out our review. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-dumps-its-10000-mah-power-bank-for-pennies-10k-units-already-sold-on-amazon-2000641824</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-dumps-its-10-000-mah-power-bank-for-pennies-10k-units-already-sold-on-amazon.1346479/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, we’re all up to our knees in gift shopping. If you’re looking for some easy corporate sponsored White Elephant gifts or perhaps an extra stocking stuffer to fill up the sock, look for something that everyone and their mother could take advantage of. I’m talking about a portable power bank. Anker has myriad of portable chargers in its product lineup, consisting of all different sizes (both physical and in the storage sense).</p>
<p>As the tech has gotten better, prices have come down so you can get something really reliable for dirt cheap — especially when there is a sale. Right now, Amazon has this travel-ready Anker power bank with a 10,000mAh capacity for 40% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5384/">Anker PowerCore is normally priced at $29 (which isn’t even all that expensive) and it is now available for just $15</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Like it says in the name, this <em>Anker PowerCore Slim 10000</em> power bank holds a total power capacity of 10,000mAh. If you’re not familiar with these units, let’s put it a bit more eloquently. This portable charger can provide an iPhone 17 with two full charges from zero to 100%. Likewise, it can bring a Galaxy S25 to 100% just barely under two times. It can also bring an iPad mini 6 back to full one time.</p>
<p>The Anker power bank is lightweight and slim in design. It can easily fit into any pocket or into any bag you may be traveling with. It measures in at 5.99 inches by 2.81 inches 0.61 inches. It’s got a scratch-resistant exterior, so don’t be afraid to put it in your bag with other stuff. It’s been durability tested to withstand a drop of up to 3.2 feet.</p>



<h2>Universally Compatible</h2>
<p>The <strong>power bank uses USB-C for both input and output</strong>, which makes charging quick and easy for any USB-C device. It comes with the USB-C capable for you to charge both your devices like your phone or tablet as well as to recharge the power bank itself. It also has a micro USB port which can be used for recharging the power bank as an alternative.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C port supports speeds of up to 15W</strong> in either direction. That’s not the fastest charging on the market, but this can still save you in a pinch if you’re in Penn Station, phones about to die, and you still need to figure what address you’re going to and train you’re taking. Afterall, remember. This thing is only $15. For what it can do, it’s an excellent deal at that price point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops don’t come cheap. Of course, the exact price depends on the specs you’re after, but machines that can handle the latest titles without slowing down often land in the $800 to $1,700 range. If you’ve been on the lookout for a solid option without blowing your budget, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p>We just spotted the 16-inch Kaigerr gaming laptop going for $490 on Amazon, after an unbelievable 71% drop, and no, it’s not a glitch. It’s an early Black Friday deal available to both Prime and non-Prime members. Hurry to grab yourself this powerhouse, as there’s no telling how long the discount or the stock will last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5382/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory Paired With Solid Storage</h2>
<p>You’re getting an impressive 16-inch display, which is slightly larger than most standard screens in this range, and pushes brilliant visuals that are both sharp and vivid. The High-Definition IPS screen is bright while also being comfortable on the eyes, so whether you’re pushing some creative boundaries in the morning or streaming at night, you will enjoy an immersive viewing experience throughout. There’s also a backlight keyboard that makes it easy to type in dim settings.</p>



<p>Power-wise, it packs a Ryzen 7 5825U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz. This translates into ultra-fast performance, even with resource-intensive apps. The processor is paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, so you’re getting both speed and sufficient storage right out of the box. These specs should be enough for most users out there initially, but if you ever want more, the laptop supports up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD expansion.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the Radeon Vega 8 integrated GPU, which keeps everything running smoothly. It’s not really meant for ultra-high-end titles at max settings, but you’ll have no problem running popular games like Fortnite or Minecraft.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, plus a bunch of ports like USB 3.2, HDMI, a full-function Type-C, a TF card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can connect external displays, add essential peripherals, and more without feeling limited.</p>
<p>All things considered, this gaming laptop delivers a lot of value for under $500. You’ll enjoy fast performance, immersive visuals, massive storage, plus quality graphics, whether you’re playing, working, or streaming. If you have been wanting to treat yourself to a powerful machine, now is a great time to make the move.</p>

"Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. [Developer] Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great."</p><p>It's true that some PC players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">review bombed Borderlands 4 on Steam</a> about its performance and optimization issues. In response, Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford openly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">challenged players' negative reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">remained defiant about it days later</a>. Pitchford also shared a number of tips for better performance on PC and consoles.</p><p>However, the PC sales figures may not tell the whole story. The American/Canadian console sales for October 2025 haven't been released yet, but PlayStation's list of the top downloads for North America reveal that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/playstation-store-october-2025s-top-downloads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped to 14th place</a> after <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/02/playstation-store-september-2025s-top-downloads" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">debuting at number three</a> a month earlier. This suggests a broader dissatisfaction with the game beyond PC users, and the PS5 version did have some optimization issues as well.</p><p>Later this month, Gearbox will drop Borderlands 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">first paid DLC pack</a>, and the developer debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-a-legendary-bee-shooting-gun-you-can-farm-for-this-week/1100-6536003/" data-ref-id="1100-6536003">a bee-shooting legendary weapon</a> this week.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery-offloads-its-1500w-power-generator-at-55-off-the-ideal-backup-for-winter-outages.1346455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re cruising right toward the the end of 2025 which means we’re in the thick of the holiday season and we’ve got lots of gift shopping to take care of. You can hold out until Black Friday or Cyber Monday in order to saver some cash, but right now, if you know where to look, you can find some pretty lucrative deals ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>For instance, Amazon has the popular portable power station — the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 — currently on sale for 55% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/">1500W AC battery normally goes for $839 and this discount brings it down to just $386</a>. This bundle also includes an AC cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is a great product to keep on hand in the back or your car or in your garage in the event of an emergency. You find yourself without power, perhaps during a thunderstorm causing a blackout, you can rely on this backup battery to keep your phones charged or to power important appliances.</p>
<p>On the subject of charging phones, the Jackery Explorer 1000 vs power station is capable of refueling your mobile devices up to 7.5 times faster the first generation model. With its six ports, you can even keep six different devices charged at once. This way, everyone in the family is covered in an emergency.</p>
<p>The six ports include<strong> three standard outlets which provide AC 1500W pure sine wave power</strong>. Then we have two USB-C ports, one able to produce 100W while the other does 30W. Then there’s the USB-A port capable of 18W.</p>



<h2>Fast-Charging</h2>
<p>When it comes time to actually recharging the Jackery power station itself, charging with standard settings will have it back up to capacity from zero in just 1,7 hours. If you need something a little faster than the default mode, you can actually set it to emergency super charging mode using the companion app on your phone. On this setting, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is able to get back up to 100% in just one hour.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t need it charged super fast and you’re more concerned about the noise it’s making. Set it to quiet charging mode which will bring it down to barely 22dB, letting it slowly recharge over five hours. You can also choose to purchase the optional solar panels which open you up to even more charging options. The panels can be used to recharge it in just three hours.</p>
<p>The battery is built to last. The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 will be able to provide you with roughly 4,000 cycles of recharging in its life. This is estimated to work out to about 10 years of use.</p>

                <p>Skydance Games is once again pushing back its upcoming action game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>--although it hasn't given any new details about when to expect the game, except "beyond early 2026."</p><p>The publisher announced the delay on its Twitter. "Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect," the announcement reads.</p><p>To that end, Skydance Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed/1100-6531490/" data-ref-id="1100-6531490">already delayed the game</a> to early 2026, has announced that it is once again pushing the date beyond that window.</p><p>You can read the full statement below:</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the first game from Skydance New Media, a developer founded in 2019 by the similarly named film studio. Amy Hennig, of Uncharted fame, is the studio's president and is leading development on the title as well, which puts players in the shoes of four playable characters, including Black Panther and Captain America, as well as a Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, and Nanali, a Wakandan spy leader.</p><p>As suggested by the game's title, Rise of Hydra is set during World War II in Nazi-occupied Paris, but--in true action-adventure form--the game will span the globe and take players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-will-be-set-in-occupied-paris-wakanda-and-beyond/1100-6528536/" data-ref-id="1100-6528536">Wakanda and beyond</a>.</p>

The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, <strong>Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card</strong> is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT99KCV8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.</p><p>The current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">a card from Onn</a>, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.</p><p>As for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/814762/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></em> requires 43.4GB of space, while <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a></em> only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade </em>requires a 93GB download.</p><p>Even physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/815946/samsung-p9-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies-2000641696</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies.1346440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limiting, especially when you need to work on multiple applications at once or share the display with others. Adding a full-size second monitor isn’t an option for everyone, but you can consider investing in a portable display that offers that extra space without the bulk.</p>
<p>Most portable monitors out there are quite affordable, with prices starting at $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less. Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/">15.6-inch <em>Yxk</em> portable screen for just $39, thanks to a 33% discount off its regular $59 price</a>. If you’ve been looking for a budget-friendly way to upgrade your work or play setup, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Consistent Visuals From All Angles</h2>
<p>The display itself measures 15.6 inches, which is the same size as most standard laptops. You’re getting a 1080p Full HD IPS screen with HDR support for clear, vibrant visuals with exceptional color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle ensures consistency from all angles, so you will be able to view the content clearly even when you’re not sitting directly in front of the screen. This also makes it easier to share the screen with others, as everyone won’t have to huddle around a single spot uncomfortably.</p>



<p>Long work sessions will no longer be tough on the eyes, thanks to Low Blue Light technology that actively reduces the amount of blue light emitted from the screen. Even better, you can choose between several display modes (mirror, extend, or second screen only) based on what you’re working on. Maybe go for the second screen mode when you need to work on different apps simultaneously, and the mirror mode while presenting! There are also two built-in speakers that make sure audio comes through clearly.</p>
<p>In terms of connectivity, it has two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini HDMI, meaning you can connect it to a range of devices, including laptops, phone, Xbox, PC, etc. The built-in stand makes it easy to set it up literally anywhere, from desk to bed.</p>
<p>Despite the generous size and power, the monitor weighs just 1.43 lbs and is only 0.31 inches thick. It slips into your laptop bag without bulking things up – ready to go where you do! Note that the discount ends soon, so it’s best to snag one for yourself before that happens.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Take-Two Interactive is using some AI tools in areas of its business that aren't creative, but the company is not looking to use those tools to replace any staff, CEO Strauss Zelnick said during Take-Two's November earnings call.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there are plenty of areas of business where the tools we have rolled out at the enterprise are helping us. We are not either using this as an excuse to, or frankly seeing the opportunity to, reduce headcount," Zelnick said on the call, answering a question about how Take-Two has rolled out AI tools in the non-creative areas of its business. "We are seeing this as an opportunity to take our very talented people and release them from more mundane tasks so they can do more creative and more interesting tasks and we can work better as an organization. But if you said, 'Can you cut your cost profile by 5% tomorrow by using all things AI?' The answer is no."</p><p dir="ltr">Zelnick has previously said in interviews that he thinks the capabilities of generative AI tools are overstated, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-believe-ai-can-compete-with-grand-theft-auto/1100-6535814/">AI can't replace games made by humans like Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. During the earnings call, he clarified those comments somewhat, but he also reiterated that he thinks AI can potentially be a useful tool in game development in the future, if "properly deployed."</p><p dir="ltr">"To be clear, I didn't say that I don't see it as a positive," Zelnick said. "What I said was that AI is based on backward-looking data sets meeting compute, meeting LLMs, and none of that replaces forward-looking genius. That's not an opinion, that's factual. I defy anyone to controvert those facts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, technology drives a lot of what we do here. Now, creativity is our lifeblood, but how do we express our creativity? We do so with computers, with technical tools. We always have. So as toolsets improve, we can become more efficient, we can become more effective. And our creative people, therefore, are freed up to be more creative. So AI, depending on how you define it, and properly deployed, of course is positive for creativity, and therefore is, of course, positive for game creation."</p><p>Zelnick's comments that AI won't lead to layoffs at Take-Two come in contrast to other executives. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a> have both said that AI advancements will lead to job losses in the short term, though they claim AI will eventually lead to higher employment rates.</p>

                <p>Major League Baseball wrapped up its 2025 season last week, and now, Sony San Diego Studios is looking ahead to the 13th iteration of MLB The Show. As expected, MLB The Show 26 is in development and the team behind the game is pulling the curtain back on a few of the features that will be included.</p><p>Sony shared the MLB The Show 26 details on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation blog</a>. Next year's game will introduce Road To The Show's high school and college modes, as well as a focus on players' mid-to-late careers. Meanwhile, Diamond Dynasty is adding two new experiences, Diamond Quest and Weekend Classic. However, the team didn't elaborate on what those experiences entail.</p><p>Franchise mode has been adjusted to be "more strategic and rewarding" in the offseason, with no further details in that area. Some of the subtle changes to the game include new animations and a revamped throw meter. The popular Negro Leagues storylines will continue with Season 4, which will once again revisit some of the players whose achievements were overlooked for decades.</p><p>Players who want to get an early start on next year's game can earn up to 26 The Show packs by playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. Earning a Now &amp; Later pack in 25 will allow players to redeem a Show pack when 26 is released by signing into the title with the same account they used for the previous game</p><p>Fans who sign up for The Show's <a href="https://account.theshow.com/scoutingreport" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scouting Report</a> by November 15 will earn five Now &amp; Later packs. On November 21, Now &amp; Later packs will be available to earn in MLB The Show 25 in the 11th Inning XP path. By early 2026, there will be a dedicated Now &amp; Later program in the game.</p><p>Sony hasn't set a date for MLB The Show 26, but the yearly editions traditionally arrive in March.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you heard the news? <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> has been delayed again</a>. The open-world crime simulator is no longer releasing in May 2026 and will now instead launch in November 2026. So why the delay? According to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, it’s because Rockstar Games is seeking “perfection” and the studio’s Metacritic track record is proof that this strategy works.</p> <p>During a November 6 earnings call, Zelnick, who leads Rockstar parent Company Take-Two, was asked about how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>GTA 6</em> delay</a> was affecting the studio and what Rockstar Games was doing at this stage in development. While Zelnick declined to get into the “inner workings” of the developer, he did talk about the company’s culture and focus on making critically acclaimed games.</p>

 <p>“I think the culture of Rockstar [Games] is extraordinary, and we’re all pushing hard to to seek perfection,” said Zelnick during the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251106169372/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2026">earnings call.</a> Take-Two’s stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/take-two-gta-vi-delay.html">sank around 7 percent</a> after news of the delay was made public. The CEO then praised how highly rated Rockstar-developed games are on review aggregator Metacritic.</p>

 <p>“I mean, the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally, speaking, not generally I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95,” explained Zelnick.&nbsp; “<em>GTA V</em>, as you know, has been the standard bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through three console generations, and to this day, is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite [being more than a] decade old, and that doesn’t happen by accident.”</p>

 <p>I’d quibble a bit here and point out that only seven of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/company/rockstar-games/?sort-options=score">Rockstar’s video game releases have hit 95 and only 4 got a higher score on Metacritic</a>, with most landing in the high 80s and low 90s. But there’s no denying that over the last 15 years Rockstar Games has mostly produced critically acclaimed blockbusters like <em>Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption II.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Zelnick added that Rockstar and all of Take-Two’s studios are focused on “seeking excellence, teamwork and kindness.” Not sure how reported efforts at union busting factor into that, but it’s a nice sentiment.</p> <p>Of course, the problem is that with each passing year and each delay, the expectations for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> grow and grow. The video game industry isn’t standing still and waiting for Rockstar to make the next big open-world masterpiece. The genre has continued to evolve thanks to games like <em>Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry, Tears of the Kingdom, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5,</em> and others. What people expect from a big, AAA open-world video game has changed a lot since 2013’s <em>GTA V</em> and 2019’s<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Will Rockstar’s pursuit of “perfection” make it harder for the studio to keep up with the rest of the industry, leading to a game that feels dated? Or will the studio innovate and help reshape the genre it practically created? We’ll find out in November 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-ceo-strauss-zelnick-2000641798">Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-takes-a-loss-on-this-v9-vacuum-cleaner-at-55-off-black-friday-kicked-off-early.1346383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Corded, heavy, and noisy vacuum cleaners should really be a thing of the past by now. If you’re still dragging one of these around every morning, wondering who ever said cleaning was therapeutic, it’s probably time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Dyson has some of the best options out there, and right now, one of its latest models just hit its lowest price ever. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/">Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum cleaner is now going for just $269 on Amazon, after a massive 55% discount</a>. It comes with multiple attachments to tackle different spaces, and does its job without waking the whole house up. This early Black Friday deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it ends soon. Get your orders in before the price goes back up to $599, or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cleans Multiple Surfaces Like a Pro</h2>
<p>This vacuum is Dyson’s most lightweight model yet, meaning you won’t be left with sore arms after a session. It comes with a whole set of attachments that include a crevice tool, a hair screw tool, a Motorbar cleaner head, and a combination tool; one for every type of surface and mess. The Motorbar cleaner head automatically adjusts to different floor types and is built to de-tangle hair as it cleans. <strong>V9’s high-velocity motor spins at up to 120,000rpm to generate up to 100 Air Watts</strong> of powerful suction, so expect it to handle even the most stubborn dirt and debris like a pro.</p>



<p>You can choose between three cleaning modes based on what you’re tackling; Eco, Med, and Boost. A <strong>single charge gets you up to 40 minutes of runtime</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to sweep through a couple of rooms, plus the living area. There’s a bright LCD screen on top that keeps you in the loop about remaining run time, current power mode, filter maintenance reminders, etc.</p>
<p>Best of all, the <strong>vacuum easily converts into a handheld</strong> for when you need to clean stairs, car seats, upholstery, etc. Once you’re done cleaning, simply press the eject button to empty the dirt into the bin. Then, you can drop it into the wall-mounted charging dock, and it will be ready for the next cleaning session in no time!</p>
<p>This is the lowest price we have seen this new model drop to. On a regular day, it would run you around $599, but you can grab it for $269 if you’re quick.</p>

In the aptly-titled Celeste's Journal quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit two separate locations on opposite ends of the Dam Battlegrounds map to collect this trader's possessions, so strap in for quite a raid.</p><p>If you want to make things easier on yourself for Celeste's Journals, you'll want to equip an augment with a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with both of the journals and return to Speranza to complete this quest. This can be tough to pull off due to the long trek you'll need to make through potentially dangerous areas to gather both of them, so also be sure to bring a decent gun and enough ammo to keep you feeling safe.</p><p>When you're ready to set off and finish this challenging quest, follow the steps below.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hi everyone, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> has been delayed again. It's now set to arrive on November 19th, 2026, about half a year on from the May 26th date it'd landed on following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">last delay</a>. November 19th, 2026 will apparently be a Thursday, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This latest delay was announced by Take-Two and Rockstar as part of the former's latest financial report. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," reads a tweet from Rockstar. The tweet begins "hi everyone", which isn't funny, but my evening brain's finding it so, mainly because it makes the post read a bit like a substitute teacher announcing that the regular teacher's stuck in traffic until November 19th, 2026, so can you all please react to that news without erupting into complete anarchy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick spoken to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">IGN</a> about the delay, which sees the much-hyped crime/love game slip a whole year from its original autumn 2025 release goal. "Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," he said. Asked what's changed since he said he was confident in that original 2025 goal, the exec added: "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>He's also chatted with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. In that discussion Zelnick stressed that Take-Two "feel really good" about the new date, adding that even though it's a year away, the company's date setting's "not that far in advance if you look at when you need to deliver a game to get it out". In the meantime, the exec said, Rockstar'll keep on plugging with GTA Online so people can get their crime/not as much love fix.</p><p>So, there you go. This latest delay comes on a day which has seen protests outside of Take-Two's London offices and Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ in response to the studio firing around 30 UK-based workers for "gross misconduct", as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Edwin reported</a>. The IWGB Union have claimed that this was done as retaliation against an attempt to unionise, while Rockstar have since asserted that the fired staff shared "confidential information on a public forum".</p>

              <p><em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> stars Captain America and Black Panther during World War II and is written by Amy Hennig, one of the masterminds behind the <em>Uncharted g</em>ames. It’s also not coming out anytime soon. It’s been delayed again and doesn’t have a new release window this time.</p> <p>“<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect,” Skydance Games announced <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986539089164972440%7Ctwgr%5E56ccbf8232d563aa478d6ce3a863eaaa720620aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">on X</a> on Thursday while everyone was preoccupied <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787">with other game delay news</a>. “To fully realize our vision for <em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important update regarding MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. <a href="https://t.co/y3WRSjVmds">pic.twitter.com/y3WRSjVmds</a></p> <p>— Skydance Games (@SkydanceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Rise of Hydra</em> was originally supposed to ship in holiday 2025. Then in May of this year, Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">announced it would be pushed back</a> to early 2026 so the team could add more “polish.” At this point it seems like there’s more than just additional polish that’s needed.</p>

 <p>For anyone who hasn’t been following the project, <em>Rise of Hydra</em> takes place in Occupied Paris and is based on the limited comic book series <em>Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers</em>. The action-adventure sports a team-up between Steve Rogers, Azzuri, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones, and Wakandan spy chief Nanali.</p>

  <p>The game was first confirmed back in 2021, teased at the D23 Expo in 2022, and finally received a full Unreal Engine 5 trailer in 2024. Skydance has been hyping the cast and the cinematics looked great but we’ve yet to see any real gameplay or get a real sense of the caliber of the game. But it would be cool if a new game Hennig worked on <a href="https://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660">finally got to actually come out</a>.</p> <p>It’s also the only <em>Black Panther</em> game we’re likely to get for some time. EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">canceled its own</a> and shut down the studio making it. Things were very different when <em>Rise of Hydra</em> was first greenlit as well. Hopefully it arrives before too much longer. Just maybe not during fall 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new update from Battlefield 6 developers reveals that bots are being reintroduced to Verified Experiences. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have been addressing bots across various modes in their title since the game’s launch. The lead producer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-bots-system-explained-by-lead-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> how the bot system works in BF6, the criteria that need to be met, and how they can help the situation. Now, a new update reveals that bots will be returning for their community experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-will-grant-reduced-xp-and-each-game-mode-supports-12-of-them">Battlefield 6 Bots Will Grant Reduced XP and Each Game Mode Supports 12 of Them</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding bots returning to Battlefield 6’s Verified Experiences was shared through an official post from the BattlefieldComms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986550835615027359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). <span>The developers had&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank">temporarily removed</a>&nbsp;bots from Verified Experiences to support healthier matchmaking in their Community Servers and Portal Experiences update last month,</span> and are now reintroducing them to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post explains that each game mode will support up to 12 bots. If bot backfill is enabled, matches will require eight players to start, with up to 6 bots filling each team. If backfill is not enabled, you will need 20 players to start the match. </p>



<p>Bots will provide reduced XP in BF6, and player XP will remain at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes). Moreover, when bots are enabled, players’ statistics, such as hours played, kill/death ratio, and total revives, will not show any gains or losses. The stats system is currently not functioning as intended and is being actively adjusted. Lastly, challenges will remain completable.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editing game files</a> to turn off matchmaking against ‘overpowered’ aim assist. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies</a> across all platforms.

		<p>Perhaps hoping to bury their bad news behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">the GTA 6 delay</a>, Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed beyond its early 2026 window and has no new release date or window.</p>
<p>In a classic apology text image announcement thing – do these have a technical term? – &nbsp;<a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440">the team writes</a>:</p>


<p>“At Skydance Games, our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and worlds we’re fortunate to work with. MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect.</p>
<p>“To fully realize our vision for MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses.”</p>

<p>It’s another significant setback to the Amy Hennig-led superhero game. Announced in March of last year, after originally been teased in 2021, the initial target was a &nbsp;2025 release… but outside of the cinematic reveal trailer last summer, we’ve heard and seen precious little about this game.</p>
<p>You’ve just got to hope they weren’t planning on a November 2026 release, because… that’d be a bit awkward now, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>
<p>The cast for the game includes Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

<p>Over 100 jobs in the UK are potentially affected</p>

<figure data-uuid="73a8897453561"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Cloud" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/73a8897453561/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cloud.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Reports have emerged that Square Enix is the latest video game company to be hit with layoffs today, with job cuts across "nearly all areas" outside of Japan including roles in sales, marketing, and publishing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC broke the news</a> earlier today and reports that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu held a video call to staff outside of Japan — including Europe, the UK, and the US — to tell employees that a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization" will be taking place.</p>
<p>This will involve staff losing their jobs and those that remain will also be required to be present in the office more often. Employees are being told the news today, and staff have already shared posts on social media announcing their departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/square-enix-lays-off-staff-in-global-restructuring?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjQ1ODk3NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYzMDYzNzc0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUJMWDNHUEw0MjkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.8hIi4eIEjJGIFf5pODYhOL8-J_P1II2FnRzzFRYs6BY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> have also corroborated this information, with today's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">progress report</a> stating that the restructuring "Implementation of structural reforms in overseas publishing organizations to further strengthen global publishing capabilities and improve operational efficiency".</p>
<p>According to the Progress Report (linked above), the Overseas Structural Reform is expected to save around 3 billion yen, or around USD $19.6 million.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Square Enix told both Bloomberg and IGN that the decision to make cuts and layoffs was "extremely difficult" though declined to tell the outlet how many jobs this will hit. According to IGN, around 137 jobs are potentially affected in the UK.</p>
<p>The company "extend[s] our heartfelt gratitude" to those affected and that "During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process."</p>
<p>This news follows the news <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-aims-to-automate-70percent-of-qa-with-generative-ai-by-2027">that Square Enix hopes</a> to "Automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" using generative AI. Today's layoffs are reportedly unrelated to that announcement, as per <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4yebaj5jk2o">Jason Schreier on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>But it does come at a time when the video game industry is struggling, and over three years after Square Enix already sold off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/embracer-group-to-acquire-crystal-dynamics-square-enix-montreal-eidos-montreal-plus-ips-for-usd300-million">a number of its international development teams to Embrace Group</a>.</p>
<p>More details are sure to emerge; we wish for all the best for those impacted by today's layoffs.</p>

			<p>Skydance Games and Amy Hennig's upcoming Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed once again, and will no longer hit its previously announced early 2026 release window, the studio announced today.</p>



<p>It's the second major game delay to be announced today, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI's delay</a> understandably taking up most of the oxygen. Skydance Games even made its announcement five minutes before Rockstar Games' post went live.</p>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Skydance Games wrote, "<em>Our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and the worlds we're fortunate to work with. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To fully realize our vision for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, we've made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026. We're grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses</em>."</p>

<p>We've known that Amy Hennig and Skydance Games have been working on a Marvel project for a while, though its official title <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">wasn't revealed until March 2024, at which point it was also slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, (shortly after Rockstar first announced GTA VI would launch in May 2026, in fact), Skydance Games confirmed that Rise of Hydra <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/">would not make its initially set 2025 release window, and pushed the game to early 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, its release window seems to be sometime mid-to-late 2026, though we've been given no more specifics than that. Wherever it lands, it's clear that 2026 is shaping up to be a year for big releases.</p>

That’s a huge gap, but Rockstar has been supporting </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto Online </span></i><span>in the years between, so it’s not like the series has been dormant all that time.

Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI was originally announced for a fall 2025 release, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-insists-it-wont-release-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-close-to-each-other">CEO Strauss Zelnick said he felt confident in</a> even amid speculation of a delay. The game was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delayed to May of 2026</a>, with Rockstar citing a need for extra time to "to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a conversation with Zelnick ahead of the announcement, IGN asked him what had changed in the year since he first said he felt confident in the Fall 2025 date. Zelnick replied, "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly a surprise that GTA 6 has been delayed again, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">given the studio's past record of delays</a>. And while most fans are prepared to wait patiently for GTA 6 regardless of when it drops, some fans are taking the news a little bit hard:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a call with investors today, Zelnick also said players shouldn't expect any changes to the cadence of updates to GTA Online due to GTA 6's delay. We also spoke to him about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">how confident he actually is in the new release date</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, Take-Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">fired dozens of employees</a>, alleging "gross misconduct" and, later, leaking "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">confidential information in a public forum</a>."

		<p>Rockstar has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed again, and is now coming out on 19th November 2026.</p>
<p>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait,” <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026">the studio writes</a>, “but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.</p>


<p>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> had previously been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">set for launch on 26th May 2026</a>, and while this was the first firm date that we had for launch from Take Two and Rockstar, it had come after the better part of a year of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs assuring</a>&nbsp;that the game was going to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>The studio has, quite awkwardly, been grabbing headlines for what has been lambasted as “brazen” union busting by leaders of the IWGB union who has been helping to coordinate unionisation efforts among employees. 30-40 employees were let go last week, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">Rockstar has claimed was for disclosing confidential details in a public forum</a>, though this is disputed by the IWGB. This will no doubt rumble on for a while to come.</p>

<p>The last we saw of GTA 6 came in May with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-a-second-trailer/">the game’s second trailer</a>:</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will take us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime story, featuring Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, who’s coming fresh out of prison, and Jason, who works with the local drugrunners after quitting the army.</p>
<p>The trailers have shown off the modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media influence and excesses feeding into the atmosphere, though that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

			<p>After it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/"> initially set to launch on May 26, 2026</a>, Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will suffer at least one more delay, as the game gets pushed from May 26, 2026, to November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Rockstar Games account. No specific reason is cited for the delay; Rockstar just says that it needed the extra time to hit the level of polish and quality it wants.</p>



<p>"<em>Hi everyone,</em>" the post begins. "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the post, Rockstar continues, "<em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern-day Vice City.</em>"</p>



<p>Earlier this year, when Rockstar announced its May 2026 date, a little more than a year before it would arrive, it seemed like that could be the final delay for the game. Not only had Rockstar called its shot a year out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">but reports had claimed it had no chance of arriving in 2025 anyway</a>. It felt like it was always going to have been a 2026 release, so now that we had a 2026 date, it felt fairly set in stone.</p>



<p>That said, this delay is absolutely not surprising, considering how much time, effort, and money has been poured into Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar and Take-Two will settle for absolutely no less than what they deem perfect, and will take all the time it needs to hit that quality bar.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> published shortly after the delay was announced, Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick commented on the delay, saying, "<em>When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally, we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach</em>."</p>
