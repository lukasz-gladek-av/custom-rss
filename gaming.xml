            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cady “Fandy” Hoffmann can usually be found on Twitch streaming <em>World of Warcraft</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em>. This week, fans found her livestreaming the birth of her first kid. They’re calling Fandy the first streamer to give birth on Twitch. Many are not sure how to feel about the newest breakthrough in streaming culture.</p> <p>“Hi twitter my water just broke so I think I’m going this live Baby time&nbsp;:)” Fandy <a href="https://x.com/fandybtw/status/1975712190050279688">wrote on X</a> at 7:57 p.m. ET on October 7. The birth took place at home surrounded by friends and family with the camera on the far side of the room and privacy when mom needed it. A nurse appeared to be present as well. The Twitch chat was displayed on the living room TV with Fandy occasionally interacting in-between contractions.</p>

 <p>“I’ve waited forever for her,” she said at one point. “Get the hell out already.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2585966702&amp;parent=kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p> <p>Giving birth in real life doesn’t happen as fast as in the movies. Fandy walks around, bounces on a yoga ball, and rests at various points during the livestream marathon before eventually getting into an inflatable water birth pool. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy even appeared in the chat at one point to wish her well. “Fandy, best of luck and congratulations. Wishing you the best in this journey,” Clancy wrote. Others in the chat said to <a href="https://x.com/Alykkat/status/1975775572845613449">fill the pool with Tylenol</a> for “optimum chances of raising a human genius.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally staying up late to watch someone livestream their birth spamming "lock in" and "push"</p> <p>you know what hell yeah</p> <p>— Liquid Eiya (@EiyaWoW) <a href="https://twitter.com/EiyaWoW/status/1975819858874110405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The stream peaked at over 30,000 viewers, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-stream-as-tens-of-thousands-tune-in-3263532/">according to<em> Dexerto</em></a>, with thousands hanging around to witness the moment the baby came out over seven hours later. Fady named her Luna and both mom and kid appear to be perfectly healthy following the landmark milestone for the Amazon-owned video platform. The two are resting peacefully at the end of the stream. Even <em>TMZ</em> felt the need to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/08/streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-twitch/">blur the newborn’s face out</a>.</p>

 <p>The stream was a wholesome look inside one of the most important and intimate moments in a person’s life. Maybe some fans preparing to have a child of their own will find how smoothly it went reassuring. So why does it feel like there are just some things that don’t need to be recorded, let alone shared with the whole world in real-time? How will the child feel about it later on in her life? Why am I, a complete stranger, even in a position to have questions like this?</p> <p>“That’s a plus one baby, boys!” said husband Adamax after seeing his newborn for the first time. May they all live happily ever after.</p>

It’s an 834-piece build, so is ideal for intermediate builders, and shows off arguably the most iconic helmet in cinematic history (seriously, who comes close other than Stormtroopers?).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target also has some Apple tech deals.

If you’ve been lacking in any of those areas, now’s the time to splurge, with books like the recently released Alchemised, movies like Moana 2 and Thunderbolts, and more included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 gamers can pick up some first-party exclusives on the cheap, too. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Vg0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last of Us Part 1</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjld0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gran Turismo 7</u></a> both see 56% discounts, dropping to $29.99 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (ha!) the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwnv0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy Limit Break Commander Deck</u></a> is now cheaper than MSRP.

                <p>Nintendo Switch 2 ended its debut summer with record-breaking sales numbers, according to data from research firm Circana.</p><p>Sharing the firm's monthly sales report for August on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7dqxt226" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Circana executive director Mat Piscatella stated that 2.4 million Switch 2 units were sold in the US during its first three months on the market, surpassing the record set by the PlayStation 4, which had sold 2.2 million units in its first three months. That makes Switch 2 the fastest-selling home console in the US through this timeframe.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m2op7dqxt226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidkuv7smumtaswzqyh3q2gypza4667mg2ayayu2jcm5ef2lazidyu" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Hardware - With 2.4M units sold LTD over its first 3 months market, Nintendo Switch 2 is now 5% ahead of the previous record setting pace of PlayStation 4, which sold 2.2M units during the 3 months ending January 2014.</p>  — Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@matpiscatella.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m2op7dqxt226?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">October 8, 2025 at 9:02 AM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Piscatella added that Switch 2 sales are pacing 77% ahead of the original Nintendo Switch when comparing their respective first three months on sale. Circana also credited Switch 2 for driving an 11% increase in spending growth in August 2025 compared to the same month in the previous year.</p><p>Looking at hardware alone, monthly spending on consoles rose to $312 million--a 32% increase--compared to a year ago. In fact, Piscatella said that the success of the Switch 2 actually "offset double-digit percentage declines" for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and even the original Switch; all three of those platforms received at least one price hike this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">most recently the Xbox Series consoles.</a></p><p>That's all to say that Switch 2 is thriving in its early months, giving the industry as a whole a much-needed boost in momentum.</p><p>The hybrid console already claimed the title of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">fastest-selling home console in the world</a> less than a week after its launch, and it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-helps-shatter-a-us-hardware-june-sales-record-that-stood-for-17-years-circana/1100-6533373/" data-ref-id="1100-6533373">breaking records left and right</a>.

			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/08/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-1/">confirmed the next batch of games</a> coming to Xbox Game Pass for October 2025, which is also the first batch of titles to come in under the new changes Microsoft and Xbox recently made to the service, specifically <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">the fact that prices were raised by 50% for a Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>



<p>Twelve games will join the now more expensive subscription service over the course of October, with three titles set to exit the service; as the cycle is always that with new games entering, old games leave. Some of the highlights for games entering this month include Ninja Gaiden 4, the first new entry in the Ninja Gaiden series in years, which is also launching into the service for those subscribed to the top Ultimate tier of Game Pass.</p>



<p>Ball x Pit is another of the 12 games that is launching into the service on day one, with Double Fine Productions' new game, Keeper, rounding out the three games launching into Xbox Game Pass this month.</p>



<p>Other titles not launching day one into the service, but still notable, include the return of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, Evil West, Pax Dei, Eternal Strands, and a preview for RPG auto-battler, He Is Coming.</p>



<p>Here's a list of all the games arriving in Game Pass this month, the dates they'll come, where they're playable, and which tiers they'll be available for, since each tier now only gets access to a certain number of games. </p>



<ul>
<li>Supermarket Simulator - October 8 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers </li>



<li>Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Editions - October 9 - PC - All tiers</li>



<li>The Casting of Frank Stone - October 14 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Ball x Pit - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Eternal Strands - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>He Is Coming (Game Preview) - October 15 - PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>

            <p>
Online video games! They're the future of the medium! Or, I guess they're already here, but still, online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> is very much in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivor's</a> future. It's a feature that's been promised for a little while now, and developer Poncle have shared a little look at it, as well as a confirmation as to when you can expect it: autumn! This autumn, to be precise, which we're currently experiencing, though a more specific window of time wasn't provided.
</p>
<p>
In a short but sweet little trailer, which shows how all you need to do to make a game online is by pressing the online button (that fabled button far too many people think is effectively real), Poncle showed the simple steps you need to take to go online. You start by setting up a lobby with a unique ID, and when your friends (or enemies) start to join, it'll show you what DLC is and isn't available to play through, presumably depending on whether everyone involved owns a specific piece or not.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The wait is nearly over 🗣️ </p><p>Online co-op is coming to Vampire Survivors on PC and consoles THIS Autumn! (yeah it's autumn right now shh) 🍂</p><p>⚠️ dial-up tones will not be included</p><p>come back next week for another new announcement! 👀 <a href="https://t.co/NEK0aWr1rS">pic.twitter.com/NEK0aWr1rS</a></p></div>— Vampire Survivors 🦇 Emerald Diorama OUT NOW 🧄 (@poncle_vampire) <a href="https://twitter.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
After that, everyone selects their character of choice, and you get to surviving vampires! There's also a short, jokey comment that I genuinely find quite fascinating: "We know no one plays together anyway lmao." This doesn't surprise me! As someone who's put a good few hours into Vampire Survivors, I can't see the appeal of playing with someone else in the slightest, it's a game I play to completely shut off - perhaps shutting off with someone else is the appeal for some, or just having something other than a fidget cube to play around with in your hands while yapping on Discord.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this feature still exists, because clearly either enough people have asked for it, no matter how small a number, or Poncle wanted the option there for anyone who might ever want it. There's a value in options like these, options for requests that come from the minority, and as long as they can be completed relatively sustainably, I hope we see more of them. Yes, I know I'm reading too much into what is obviously a joke! That is the curse called writing, I'm afraid.
</p><p>
In any case, Poncle also said there's another announcement coming next week which looks like it has something to do with someone in a crappy skeleton custom in the woods. There's also a visual suggestion that there'll be more announcements in the weeks following that one, so I guess there's big plans for update 1.4 you'll have to keep an eye out for!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the many consequences of modern fandom’s obsession with “canon” is that stories that have open-ended themes or choices are now held to a new standard of scrutiny. Swaths of the video games we play are about choice, whether that be in the weapons we wield or the sacrifices we make; however, because the internet has become fixated on listing events in bullet points on wikis, the act of making choices and watching the consequences unfold isn’t enough. Some players want to be “right,” and they want video games and their creators to tell them so. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is not primarily a choice-based game, but it does offer one at the very end that changes the story entirely. Since the RPG launched back in April, fans have debated the merits of both outcomes, but because a sequel is coming and some people need validation, the developers at Sandfall Interactive have come out and said there is no “correct” ending.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>ends in one of two ways</span></a><span>, depending on whether or not the player chooses to play the final duel as either the paintress Maelle or Verso, the painted version of her deceased brother. In an interview with Lits Play, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen spoke about how both endings of the game are valid and were made with purpose. Neither was meant to be the “other” or “wrong” choice.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I tell everyone there is no ‘correct’ ending, there is no ‘canon’ ending, there is no ‘official Sandfall’ ending,” Svedberg-Yen said. “Both endings are there for a reason; we put them both there for a reason; they were designed in a very particular way. Neither is perfect. Both are heartbreaking in their own ways. Both of them have parts that make you glad, parts that you feel like, ‘okay, I want a happy ending for these characters,’ but both of them also have their own cost. It’s a reflection of reality. You know, a lot of times, some people’s happiness does come with its costs. Things are very rarely perfect. And I think we were really trying to also show both sides of the story.”</span></p>

  <p><span>She’s right. Obviously, the debate over which is the morally correct answer is a whole different discussion. I personally chose the Maelle ending because it felt thematically appropriate, while also understanding that the Verso choice is probably the one that provides the most closure. Both have their merits and drawbacks, and one of the rewarding things about choice-based games is that we get to argue about those forever. However, this modern need to have these decisions declared “correct,” either by the text or by the developers, has added an often dismissive layer to those discussions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To some extent, this goes back to an attachment players have to their own “canon.” If a sequel like </span><i><span>Infamous Second Son </span></i><span>chooses one of its predecessor’s endings to build off of, it raises questions about the other choice. Why was it there if it was going to be cast aside? What does it say about players who chose the other option? Were they wrong? Was any debate about the morality or merits of that choice for nothing? This is a cloud that has been hanging over the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game for nearly a decade, as the remnants of BioWare have to figure out how they’re going to make a fifth game set in the Milky Way that either works for all of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>’s galaxy-defining final choices</span></a><span>, or picks one and moves the timeline forward from there.</span></p>

 <p><span>BioWare is an interesting example to point to when it comes to this dilemma, because even though the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>communities love to throw around terminology like “canon” to refer to specific choices that are chosen by default if players don’t import a world state or save from a previous game, the studio doesn’t view it that way at all. The team has even said it would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112"><span>rather not acknowledge a decision</span></a><span> in a sequel like </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </span></i><span>than contradict it. This allows players to feel like their world state is valid, even if they’re not staring the ramifications of it in the face every game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe it’s because I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>grew up spending a lot of my early roleplaying days</span></a><span> working within the gaps that developers didn’t fill, but I’ve never looked for confirmation from games that I was “right” when I made a decision.&nbsp; The need for a game or developer to justify what you’ve done suggests that making choices in games is about aligning your actions with the “true vision” of the developers, rather than actually expressing your own agency within the story. I almost always treat roleplaying in games as an opportunity for self-reflection. It’s a big part of why I make myself in character creators. These are my stories, and I’ll write them how I want. I’d rather a developer not pat me on the head and tell me everything I did was “correct” or aligned with canon; that’s not what it’s about, and it shouldn’t be a factor in our decision-making process.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the uncertainty about “what really happened” is too much for some people. For me, that flexibility, the co-existence of multiple possibilities and my ability to shape which way things go, is the best part of when games give me that autonomy.&nbsp; But the best choice-based games are the ones we’re still debating years later, not the ones for which the developers have retroactively decided which was the “one true choice.” So shoutout to Sandfall Interactive and Svedberg-Yen for sticking beside the decision they handed players, rather than capitulating to some imagined idea of “canon.” I hope they stay true to that in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>the inevitable sequel</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>Building a gaming PC can be a rewarding experience. I can also be frustrating as all hell. Sometimes, it is better to just get something that’s already assembled. It saves time both on shopping side of things when you’re trying to source each part you need as well as after it arrives. No delicate assembly. No headache-inducing cable management in the case. No dropping screws off the table and having them roll under the couch. Just take it out of the box and and start downloading&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>. Right now for Prime Big Deals Days, you can save quite a big on a pre-built gaming PC. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">The Alienware Aurora gaming desktop has dropped by 17%. That’s doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s taking the price down from $1,845 to just $1,535. You’ll save $310.</a> That extra cash can buy an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription for… just shy of one year? Wow, Microsoft needs to get a grip.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Top-tier Gaming Versatility</h2>
<p>Let’s talk specs. This Alienware gaming PC tower is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7F processor and is packing the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card. You’ll be able to play any modern AAA game and even be able to push the settings quite a bit, maintaining a high and stutter-free framerate. It can even handle livestream your gaming to Twitch or YouTube.</p>
<p>You get a whopping 32GB of RAM plus a whole 1TB of storage. That’s a ton of space to get your started downloading all sorts of games off Steam, the Epic Games Store, or any of the other PC gaming storefronts. This build will also prove to perform reliably outside of gaming. Graphics and processor intensive workflows will be breezy on this machine. Touch up large files in Photoshop or edit together videos in 4K without a problem.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about overheating, this PC employs a 240mm heat exchanger which uses liquid cooling on the CPU to heighten thermal resistance. That should keep the temperatures relatively low during longer gaming sessions. It’s well ventilated allowing for efficient airflow, cooling and acoustics.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be a capital G “Gaming” PC without some RGB lighting. You can create and edit the AlienFX lighting across the whole ecosystem using the free Alienware Command Center software.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">During Prime Big Deals Days, this RTX 5070 gaming PC from Alienware has come down by a dramatic $310.</a> Get it for just $1,535 for a limited time before the Amazon sales event is over.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/a-universal-time-aut-codes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-universal-time-aut-codes-october-2025.1319995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Universal Time is an action-adventure game within <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-safe-for-kids-truth-parental-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, boasting core RPG elements and a world that’s been heavily inspired by Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure and other similar anime stories. A Universal Time requires players to explore a large world and gain powers along the way. Alongside their exploration of the map, they will be required to take on various opponents, including NPCs as well as real players. Although the biggest inspiration for A Universal Time is Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, with the game including many of the anime’s ‘Stands’, it also showcases characters from other popular anime, including Dragon Ball, One Piece, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have to progress through the game to get stronger and unlock more powerful moves, and for newer players to the game, that can be a daunting task. With both PvP and PvE fights involved, getting ahead of the competition fast is of utmost importance, and using codes is a good way to make some quick progress. A Universal Time codes give players various rewards in the game, including Skin Chests, UCoins, UShards, and more, all of which will come in handy to the average player.</p>

<p>Although the game currently has only two active codes, more are likely to be added in the future. A Universal Time codes often have fixed timeframes when they will be usable, meaning that when existing codes expire, new ones will be added. </p>

Although you can keep track of new codes by joining the game’s official Discord or through their socials, keeping tabs on our page is going to be the easiest way to do so.</p>

There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s more likely that we’ll get further updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, which just announced the upcoming Burning Springs update and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">the addition of The Ghoul from Prime Video’s Fallout TV show</a>, featuring the likeness and voice work from Walton Goggins himself. It’s also worth noting that Season 2 of Fallout, which is set in New Vegas, is due out this December, so maybe we’ll get a new trailer or images.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success">Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series reached a new level of attention.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps%E2%80%99-manbreaker-did-not-break-me.1319977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been trying to climb the side of this sheer cliff face for several hours using only my feet. The path is tricky and winding but at this point I know the footholds better than the faces of some of my friends. Some of them involve slightly shimmying my feet on a thin ridge of rock. Others involve lifting my leg out from the cliff face, swinging it over, and planting my foot until I feel something firm enough to lift my body up. I misjudge a step, my character tumbles; his body ping pongs back and forth between the side of the path and the conveniently built spiral stairwell next to the path, his head catching the green steel railing. I feel numb at this point. My character groans, gets up, I try again. This is the Manbreaker in <em>Baby Steps</em>, an unpleasant task that I have been told I do not need to do.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>This article contains some plot spoilers for <em>Baby Steps</em></strong>.</h3><p><em>Baby Steps </em>is the latest game from Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and, of course, Bennett Foddy. You may know Foddy from <em>QWOP,</em> <em>GIRP </em>and <em>Getting Over It, </em>games infamous for abstracting movement so that the player will often cartoonishly fall down<em>. </em>&nbsp;It follows an emotionally stunted thirty five year old man named Nate (played by Cuzzillo)&nbsp;who is stuck in a cocoon of permanent social isolation. Nate smokes a lot of weed, lives in his parents' basement, watches <em>One Piece, </em>and eats a lot of pizza. Suddenly he is Isekai’d from his couch to a surreal, looping, mountainous world that gradually slopes upwards to a mountain top. A helpful man named Jim (played by Foddy) attempts to explain the situation to him and give him shoes, but Nate refuses any help, instead insisting he’s just gonna go. The only thing he wants is to find a toilet because he needs to pee quite badly and refuses to pee outdoors.</p><figure></figure><p>Like <em>QWOP</em>, <em>Baby Steps</em> approximates natural movement in a way that feels stilted and unnatural at first. Whereas <em>QWOP </em>binds your thighs to the Q and W and your calves to O and P on the keyboard, <em>Baby Steps </em>binds the act of raising your left and right legs to L2 and R2 respectively, with trigger depth determining how much you raise your leg. A raised leg is then moved using the left analogue stick. This, along with <em>Returnal</em>, is one of the few games that uses the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_AE21WqhU4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adaptive Triggers</a> on the DualSense beautifully as it adds real texture to the sensation of walking. When you actually get good at using your legs, the sensation of walking feels organic in a jarring way.</p><p><em>Baby Steps </em>hit me at a strange time in my life. I currently have a broken foot with several pins sticking out of it. I have been sleeping on my couch since early August so that I can properly elevate my leg and not disturb my girlfriend’s sleep. I am a month into using <a href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prosthetic crutch that is not unlike a peg leg,</a> a device that forces you to learn how to walk again in a stilted and alien way, but one that becomes second nature over time. I even went to a four day techno festival in nature that I have been going to for over a decade because my pride refused to let the broken foot win. The experience was brutal on my body, yet rewarding. I frequently climbed a steep incline to my cabin and crossed a treacherous floating bridge over a lake using trekking poles to stabilize myself. People kept offering help that I often refused. I was alarmed by how quickly I parsed <em>Baby Steps</em>’ internal logic.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the game, Jim constantly offers Nate help. He is like a bodhisattva, a sherpa whose only purpose in this world is to help the others get to the top of the mountain. And yet, through a combination of anxiety and stubbornness, Nate steadfastly refuses to outwardly accept help. His repeated rebukes of Jim builds throughout the entire game, and Nate’s bullshit attitude and awkwardness increasingly wear away at Jim’s patience. As you climb the mountain, going from biome to biome, you eventually see Jim’s masterpiece in the distance: a 250 story green spiral staircase (seemingly based on a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221883/Taihang-Mountains-300ft-spiral-staircase-Chinese-tourists-taste-high-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real one in the Taihang mountains</a>) that he built for all the hikers to get to the top of the mountain easily.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Jim is pleased with his staircase. It helps a lot of people achieve their goal of climbing up the mountain where they had previously toiled. But Nate is Nate, and he does not want to take it, instead pointing to a winding and dangerous mountain path.&nbsp;</p><p>JIM: “You can’t, it’s too hard for you.”</p><p>NATE: “It’s not that hard.”</p><p>JIM: “They call it the Manbreaker.”</p><p>NATE: “The Manbreaker?”</p><p>JIM: “Yeah, because many men have been broken trying to get up that thing.”</p><p>Nate boasts that he’s going to do it while Jim tells him if he does that he’s going to be bashing his head against the Manbreaker for the next five years. This devolves into childish bickering, with Jim forbidding Nate from climbing the stairs, insisting that if and when he gives up on the Manbreaker, he must call Jim “lord,” because he is the lord of the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>Narratively this is a beautiful setup. <em>Baby Steps </em>is ultimately a game about swallowing your pride and accepting help, but one that fills itself with many totally optional challenges. It can be a brutally difficult game, but it is often only as hard as you want it to be. Nate has fucked you here a little bit, because he is objectively in the wrong and should just take the stairs. But Jim is being a dick, something he has every right to be given Nate’s behavior. It’s not that I wanted Nate to win, I just had to know what happened if Nate actually pulled that off. So my long journey on the Manbreaker began.</p><figure></figure><h2><strong>The Journey Begins</strong></h2><figure></figure><p>What makes the Manbreaker so punishing is not that the individual steps are harder than what you’ve faced, it’s that there’s a lot of them. The cliffs are constructed in a way that if you fall you are unlikely to go further than the base of the stairs, but you will often have to start from the beginning. Individual steps are just difficult enough to seem doable with a handful of distinct choke points in between. If you know what you are doing and don’t miss a single step, you can scale the entire thing in about twelve to twenty minutes. The real problem lies in landing every step, not slipping once. </p><figure><figcaption>This is actually way easier to pull off than shimmying on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s an annoying slope that requires you to quickly scurry early on that will regularly cause you to slide off until you figure out the momentum of a scurry step. Sometimes the game gives you multiple ways to approach the same obstacle: one challenge right before the halfway point can be solved either by shimmying in a narrow ledge to your right or, more consistently I discovered, by placing your foot on a tiny outcropping to the left of the rock and swinging your legs over a few ledges back and forth twice.</p><figure><figcaption>The cutscene if you take the stairs up.</figcaption></figure><p>At the halfway point through the climb, either on the stairs or the Manbreaker, you will receive one of two cutscenes. Both involve Mike, a friendly hiker also played by Foddy who you have interacted with in the past. If you are on the stairs, Mike will be on the Manbreaker. He says Jim told him not to take the stairs, saying “Mike, you’re ready.” He feels confident in how far he has come in his abilities and expounds on the rapturous, sublime nature of climbing the path. Nate says the stairs are pretty good too. If you are on the Manbreaker, Mike instead is on the stairs. He asks you why you are doing that, and instead suggests you give up and take the stairs. No matter what path you take, the game tests your conviction by suggesting you are taking the wrong one.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>If cutscene if you take the manbreaker.</figcaption></figure><p>My girlfriend watched with a combination of bewilderment and schadenfreude as I subjected myself to this over several evenings. “Oh yeah you see you should not have done that,” she would chime in when my foot slipped and I tumbled hundreds of painful feet. At first I would get exceedingly pissed off whenever I fell off. And yet every time I fell off, I got less pissed. As the number of falls increased and I memorized my footholds, I realized that the Manbreaker was teaching me <em>Baby Steps</em> at a higher level. The frustration subsided. The Manbreaker could not hurt me. I locked in.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><h2><strong><strong>On locking in</strong></strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="the most confusing motivational speech of all time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yutsIpLK2Rs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When I lock in, I think of a particular edit from streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northernlion</a>. He is playing <em>The Game of Sisyphus</em>, a game clearly indebted to Foddy’s <em>Getting Over It</em>. The video is a supercut of him shouting a mixture of zenlike phrases and Instagram grindset guy advice. He is attempting to push the rock up the hill while the song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPiAzPuxRG4&amp;list=RDwPiAzPuxRG4&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paranoia"<em> </em></a>by Kentenshi (itself a remix of the song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI97zHMoQw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Girl A</a>") plays. Northernlion’s advice is sublime and contradictory, punctuated by an aggressive drum machine and distorted Vocaloid samples. It is a speech that seems to suggest that everything is possible and nothing is possible, that your actions are both meaningless and, simultaneously, the only point in the world. If you listen to it enough times, you begin to reconcile those contradictions. On an even longer timeline, it begins to resemble a prayer.</p><p>“Lock in. Lock in. Get it twisted,” Northernlion begins. “If you lock in you can do anything. Motherfucker. Get it twisted, your actions impact nothing, your fate is predetermined, the only thing that you can change is your reaction to it. You can do anything you set your mind to, the world is a playground designed for you and only you to achieve your highest level ambitions. If you wait 90 minutes to wake up until you drink your first cup of coffee, nothing can stop you. If you duct tape your mouth when you fall asleep, nothing can stop you. Get it twisted. You are a pawn in a universe chess match. You mean nothing to God if they even exist. You’re a rounding error. You’re two pennies on a Fortune 500 company’s balance sheet; they don’t care about you in the slightest. Get it twisted. Everybody gets what they deserve in this life. If you put in effort you can achieve anything. Successful people are better people. Get it twisted! The circumstances of your birth determine where you are going to go. Nothing else matters at all: your own level of education, your attitude, your level of effort, your friends, your network, your business, your credentials. Motherfucker!”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I consider this post a companion piece to the video.<span></span><span>@BPDboymoder</span></figcaption></figure><p>Those words swirled around in my head with every attempt, their contradictions becoming a centering hum. Waves of frustration would hit me, subside, and the words would redouble my resolve. Nothing was preventing me from leaving, but I could not leave. I had spent too much time studying the cliff face, learning its contours, the end was in sight. I would finish this. Lock in. Get it twisted.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Other broken men</strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Baby Steps: Manbreaker breaks Grubb some more and more | GB Plays" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6C0qHaPwDRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I was not the only broken man attempting the Manbreaker. As I was throwing myself off the mountain I saw others attempt this. Frequent contributor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iantothemax.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Walker</a> was being punished by the path, as was Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb</a>, who streamed his attempts and got to the top before I did.</p><p>“I was already really into <em>Baby Steps</em> by the time I got to the manbreaker, and I was already onboard with the game's central metaphor (as I see it),” Grubb told me. “That is that all you can control in life is the next step that you take. Even if you're not that great at taking steps, that's the only option you have. Even if you get lost, that's the only option you have. So just take the next step, and eventually you'll take enough steps and you can look back and say: look how far I've come.When I got to the Manbreaker, it felt like the culmination of that idea but also an argument against it.”</p><p>“I think a lot of people will take the cutscene between Jim and Nate at the Manbreaker as a challenge to take the Manbreaker. But I definitely took it as a challenge to take the stairs—to ask for help,” he said. "Someone built this tool to help me get to where I'm going, but the toxic individualism—that has fueled me in life and that has been ingrained in me by my culture—wouldn't let me.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Grubb Breaker part 5 or something | GB Plays" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwhFYM0dt-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“I need to feel like I did it on my own,” Grubb continued. “And I think that's actually a weakness. A flaw inserted into me strategically by a ruling class that does not want me to rely on others because then we might actually start working together.”</p><h2><strong>Mercy in design</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>A shortcut, either out or in. This is useful when the first part of the path stops being fun.</figcaption></figure><p>For as intricate and brutal as the design of the Manbreaker is, it is also compassionate. Each time you hit a new part of the Manbreaker you have to learn the encounter, and by the time you get to the upper layers of it, the prior parts begin to be tedious. But halfway through the run, at the point where you talk to Mike, the stairwell and path become close enough to almost touch for two levels. It is possible to give up on the Manbreaker at this point and take the stairs, or to use the stairs as a shortcut for finishing the end of the Manbreaker. If you decide to take the shortcut after you’ve already gotten the cutscene, the game does not penalize you for this and gives you the same outcome as if you had done it in one go. This is how both Jeff Grubb and I attempted the final climb. I refuse to call anybody "lord," but I’m old enough to know that repeating the bottom wasn’t proving anything.</p><figure></figure><p>The last series of steps in the Manbreaker are by far the worst in the whole run. The first step requires you to place your foot gently on a declining slope, let your body slide for half a second, then catch the platform with your other foot. You could spend an hour just mastering the timing of this one step. But the game dispenses this complex task with a small kindness, and positions most of these steps save the last few over your previous path. If you fall, you will more than likely have a second chance.</p><h2><strong>This is the end</strong></h2><p>(<strong>SPOILERS FOR THE END OF THE MANBREAKER/STAIRS BELOW</strong>)</p><p>This scenario has two potential endings. If you swallow your pride and take the stairs the whole way up, you are ambushed by Jim at the top. He is glowing and smug and makes you call him lord. He gives you a little ribbon and proclaims you are in an elite club called “Jiminny’s Crickets,” and the game gives you an achievement for this, almost condescendingly.</p><figure></figure><p>If, on the other hand, you decide to take the Manbraker then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE_L57Bqak&amp;pp=0gcJCfwJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nate arrives at the top gasping and gloating.</a> Jim is confused, unable to comprehend how Nate did it. Nate boasts that the climb was easy and suggests that perhaps the stairs were superfluous.</p><p>“But if the stairs are superfluous then maybe…Jim was superfluous,” Jim says in a broken voice, adding, “Lord.”&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Jim then proceeds to throw himself off the cliff face (he is probably fine considering everyone in this world is immortal.). Nate broke a helpful man’s spirit, shattered Jim’s purpose in life, learned nothing about accepting help, and the game gives you no achievement for it.</p><figure><figcaption>Almooooost.</figcaption></figure><p>As toxic as it is, the Manbreaker felt worth it. After learning to carefully bottle up and regulate my emotions, triggering the cutscene caused a rush of relief to flood through my body all at once. The Manbreaker did not break me, but it changed me significantly. It is not simply a crucible of difficulty, but a beautifully written and designed riddle about rancid pride and sublime challenge chiseled directly into the cliff face. To beat it transforms you into a <em>Baby Steps</em> climbing god just as the game reaches its logical conclusion.</p><figure><figcaption>I am the lord.</figcaption></figure><p>“What do you do now?” my girlfriend asked.&nbsp;</p><p>“I guess I’ll just finish the game,” I responded, and climbed to the game’s conclusion at a breezy, unworried pace.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, 10/8/25, 12:55pm--</strong>An original version of this article occasionally misstated the name of character Jim. </em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-day-2025-broadcast-announced-for-october-23.1319962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios announced that the Fallout Day 2025 broadcast would be streamed live on October 23, 2025, at 1 PM Eastern Time via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>, and Steam. Bethesda said fans can tune in to learn new information and announcements about 'existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events'. October 23 is no random date: it's when the two-hour-long nuclear exchange between the United States and China led to the post-nuclear setting of Fallout.</p>



<p>When Bethesda mentions existing games, the mind immediately goes to Fallout 76, since it's the only franchise game that gets regular updates. However, Fallout 76 just got a major reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the deep dive of the Burning Springs update</a>. In December, Bethesda Game Studios will release a major land expansion, bringing Fallout players to Ohio for the first time in the franchise. The new region draws heavily on Fallout 3 and New Vegas aesthetics, aiming to recapture the feel of a harsh, depraved wasteland seen in those games. </p>



<p>Then there's the introduction of The Ghoul, the character played by Walton Goggins in the TV show, who is coming to the game and will introduce the bounty hunting feature with tiered contracts (grunt and head hunts). Bethesda hopes this will create ongoing, repeatable content that encourages both solo and cooperative play. The randomization of contract locations and the public event nature of head hunts foster community interaction and provide a robust source of rewards, addressing players’ desires for challenging but rewarding activities. </p>



<p>There might be some additional tidbits about the Burning Springs update to be shared in the upcoming Fallout Day broadcast, but by and large, the reveal for Fallout 76 already happened. As such, franchise fans are already hoping to hear something about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-3-oblivion-remasters-xbox-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster</a>, as that might fall under 'existing Fallout games'. Of course, it's always possible that Bethesda has just found a new platform to launch Fallout 4 on, like the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blink-video-doorbell-is-almost-free-amazon-offloads-its-own-brand-at-a-loss-2000632081</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blink-video-doorbell-is-almost-free-amazon-offloads-its-own-brand-at-a-loss.1319956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has made serious moves into home security with its <em>Ring</em> and <em>Blink</em> brands and gives homeowners accessible ways to monitor their properties without professional installation. If you want a doorbell camera that’s effective, affordable and lets you keep tabs on everything happening at your front door, <strong>Blink is the way to go</strong>. The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/"> newest model of the Blink video doorbell just hit a record low price of $34 (down from $69) for Prime Big Deal Day</a>, and this deal ends tonight. It’s <strong>exclusively available to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Years’ Worth of Battery Life Redefines Everything</h2>
<p>The larger pain point with doorbell cameras is often the power issue: Hardwired versions demand electrical work that the average person would like to do without, and battery-powered versions require charging every few weeks. The <strong>Blink video doorbell eliminates this nuisance with a two-year battery life on two AA lithium batteries</strong>. Consider that: you install it once and don’t mess with it again until the year 2027. No climbing ladders to haul it down to charge, no panic should it die on vacation, no maintenance woes.</p>



<p>The camera provides a <strong>vertical field of view that captures people from head to toe</strong>&nbsp;which matters more than you might think. Standard doorbell cameras often cut off packages left on the ground or miss the tops of tall visitors’ heads. This full-body perspective means you see delivery drivers placing packages, kids trick-or-treating, or anyone approaching your door in complete context. The 1<strong>080p HD resolution delivers clear images</strong> during daylight, and infrared night vision switches on automatically after sunset to maintain visibility in complete darkness.</p>
<p>The integrated Sync Module Core (see picture above) is the control center and connects your doorbell to the home’s Wi-Fi network and facilitates all communication between the doorbell and the phone version of the Blink app. It is <strong>simple to plug the module into a standard outlet somewhere in your home</strong> and get the doorbell connected to the phone. Should the button be pressed or motion be detected, the event is captured by the module, then triggers an instant notification on the device.</p>



<p>Detection areas let you decide what areas will cause recording: If the doorbell is pointing at the busy street, then you can mask that section off so cars passing by don’t jam your phone with unimportant notifications. Focus the detection zone on your sidewalk and porch, then receive notifications for activity that is relevant. <strong>You can customize the sensitivity via the app</strong>&nbsp;which gives you the freedom to decide just how much movement will trigger a recording.</p>
<p>The doorbell is controllable via Alexa voice control and can be integrated with other compatible Alexa devices. Ask Alexa to display your front door and the feed is shown on Echo Show devices around your house.</p>
<p>At just $34, that is a 50% off deal and the lowest price on this model ever. Make sure you don’t miss it before it runs out of stock.</p>

              <p>We’re deep into Prime Big Deals Days now — Amazon’s two-day sales even where you can save a bunch of cash on products across every category. It’s a great time to pick up that espresso maker you’ve been eyeing or that bidet your brother have been trying to convince you to get for months. Something you might have been waiting on for a discount is one of those TV backlights. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/">Good news, the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is one of the Prime Big Deals this week and you can save as much as 46%.</a></p>
<p>There are three different sizes to match however big your TV is. The 11.8-foot light strip is sized for TVs between 55 inches and 65 inches. The 16.4-foot light strip is made for TVs between 75 inches and 85 inches. Then the 21-foot light strip is for your mega mondo-sized TVs at 98 to 100 inches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>For shorthand, we’ll call them small, medium, and large. The small set normally priced at $140 has come down to $75. The medium dropped from $170 to an even $100. And then the big boy large light strip is down from $220 to just $150.</p>

<h2>Synchronize Color</h2>
<p>The way the Govee light strips work is a camera sensor is placed on the top of your TV. This model actually has a dual-camera sensor to more accurately capture the color on screen. It then takes that color and assigns them around the light strip which you’ve installed behind your TV around the edge. Each light strip has 60 LEDs per meter and they glow matching the color on screen as if to extend your viewing across the wall and room.</p>



<p>You can customize how your Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 looks. Using the app, manually adjust the saturation of the lighting effects to either be super vibrant or more subtle. Go with whichever fits the vibe of what you’re watching. It works well with movies, shows, or even video games. Casting the vibrant colors of each new zone you come across in <em>Hollow Knight</em>: Silksong can dramatically enhance your experience.</p>
<p>Combine the backlight LED with other Govee products such as wall or corner lamps. Have all the lights in your home synchronize to what’s on screen, bathing you and your living room in colorful light.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/">Get your set of the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 on sale today for as low as just $75.</a> Discount will be for as much as 46% at least through Prime Big Deals Day.</p>

            <p>
How about a fresh look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</a>, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-call-starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-a-sequel-the-original-still-has-years-of-updates-ahead">not-an-Astroneer-sequel</a> from System Era? The developer revealed an extended look at gameplay yesterday, detailing what it is you'll be doing exactly. As has already been established, it's an online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> game, one of those "friendslop" kind of games you'll see people be mean about on Ditter and TikTok comments. To be specific, you can play it solo, or with three of your friends, but there are elements that draw on other players (more on that in a bit).
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of These Kinds Of Games (we really should agree on a name for them at this point), to start off you'll have to prepare for the challenge ahead. You do this on the titular S.S. Starseeker, a big ole ship filled with a bunch of other cutely designed also titularly titled Astroneers. Here, you'll buy and craft different tools and items to bring with you, and decide what it is you want to take with you on expeditions. That might be something useful, or, if you're that kind of person who just likes to goof around while everyone else actually has fun playing the game, you could bring a beach ball instead.

<p>
Expeditions! Structurally these sound pretty par for the course. You land on a planet, you go do a mission or a task or somesuch, and you get back before your oxygen runs out. Along the way there might be alien creatures to do battle with, bits of loot to plunder, that sort of thing.
</p><p>
The Astroneery element of it all is that you have a terrain tool that you can modify in different ways. At its base you just remove terrain, but different nozzles can make it shoot out water, build up the land, launch aliens or yourself into the sky, etc.
</p>
<p>
There's no procedural generation to be found on the planets you visit either, the main one the game is launching with, Tefra, was made by hand, so you'll be able to revisit particular locations from expedition to expedition. As you progress, you'll also unlock more landing zones to other parts of the planet, which subsequently have tougher challenges to face.
</p>
<p>
These challenges might include something simple like repairing some equipment, or bringing up a receiver to a high point on the map. Some of them might even encourage you to work with other groups of players to complete them, a point I quite like - there's not enough online games about collaboration out there!
</p>
<p>
No exact release date just yet, but Starseeker: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/astroneer">Astroneer</a> Expeditions is due out some time in 2026.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-adds-the-grinch-christmas-adventures-after-big-price-hike.1319911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft has announced the the first list of games being added to Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-price-subscription-renewal-delay-xbox-2000632625">since the service’s unpopular price hike news rolled out last week</a>. It includes <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures – Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em>, the update to a 2023 co-op holiday adventure that I’m sure fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>The “festive platformer” has you searching for collectibles, snowboarding down Mount Crumpit, and even parachuting through Whoville. Apparently that was not enough to impress many of the only 27 people who reviewed the $40 Steam version. “This game is BAD!” wrote one. “Quite terrible all things considered,” wrote another. “The original game from the 90’s was a world play style game with objectives and missions…this is a game for a 5 year old.”</p>

 <p>Don’t let that completely dissuade you from checking it out though! Here’s everything coming to the various, newly priced tiers of Game Pass in October 2025:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><em>Supermarket Simulator&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 8</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate and Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Editions</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 9</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Casting of Frank Stone </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 14</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ball x Pit </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Eternal Strands </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>He Is Coming&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Game Preview)</strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(PC) – October 16</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Keeper </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 17</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Evil West </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>That is 12 games in total, and some of them are shaping up to be quite good, especially <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. But it’s also worth noting that only three of these games require Game Pass Ultimate. The rest are all available with Game Pass Premium or Game Pass PC. This is the last batch hitting before the new $30-a-month price hits most Ultimate subscribers on November 4, so while Microsoft might be trying to win players over with a few surprises in November, this month is mostly what we expected it to be.</p> <p>The three games leaving Game Pass on October 15 are <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Core Keeper</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.</em> <em>Cocoon</em> in particular is an outstanding puzzle adventure you can finish in just a couple of sittings. If you haven’t given it a try or already beaten it, I highly recommend checking it out in the next week before it’s gone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-has-clearance-vibes-as-27%e2%80%b3-ultragear-gaming-monitor-hits-its-cheapest-ever-to-compete-with-samsung-deals-2000632186</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Prime Day deals are going in full swing, making it a great time to invest in a gaming monitor. If you’ve been looking for something feature-packed at a more approachable price, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">we’ve just spotted the 27-inch LG UltraGear QHD gaming monitor going for $297 on Amazon, which is a 41% discount off its regular price.</a></p>
<p>This is a significant drop, but it’s only limited to Prime users at the moment. Non-Prime users can snag it up for $349, which is also a nice $151 off. Prime members also enjoy free delivery, but just be sure to get your orders in soon. The retailer has marked it as a limited-time deal, and we won’t be surprised if it expires soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Color Accuracy on a Massive Screen</h2>
<p>The 27-inch screen size is quite spacious, offering a decent 2560×1440 QHD resolution. The IPS panel offers vibrant colors, exceptional contrast, and impressive detail – all of which come together to create an immersive gaming or streaming experience. It also supports VESA DisplayHDR 400 and covers up to 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, so you can expect deeper blacks and more visual accuracy. There’s an ultra-fast 1ms (GtG) response time, paired with a 240Hz refresh rate to keep slowdowns and lags at bay. Racing past opponents or engaging in competitive matches where every second counts; this monitor won’t disappoint.</p>



<p>It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and also supports AMD FreeSync Premium. You can choose a GPU without worrying about screen tearing or stutter. Connectivity options are plenty – HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and a 4-pole headphone out that supports DTS Headphone:X. The stand is also adjustable, so you can play around with tilt and height to get the right viewing angle for yourself. This is also great for setups that multiple people use. You don’t really have to settle for an awkward angle while trying to make it work for you.</p>
<p>LG also includes an Enhanced Gaming GUI that lets you choose between display presets like Gamer, FPS, or RTS modes for an even better view.</p>
<p>All in all, this deal gets you an impressive, high-resolution gaming monitor for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">If you’re a Prime member, you can get it for under $300. Non-prime members are in luck, too, since they can grab one for $349, which is still a good discount on a model this packed.</a> It’s a limited-time discount, so if you’ve been thinking of making the upgrade, we recommend grabbing it as soon as you can.</p>

                <p>Fans of the Dead Space series have expressed strong dissatisfaction over the pricing of a new crossover bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-new-skate-game-in-15-years-is-out-now-and-its-free/1100-6534774/" data-ref-id="1100-6534774">EA's free-to-play title, Skate, currently in early access</a>. The bundle features a cardboard-style Isaac Clarke costume, a themed skateboard, the Necro Stomp emote, and several stickers. The bundle is priced at 3,350 San Van Bucks, the game's virtual currency, but the pricing structure forces players to spend a minimum of $35 to acquire the necessary in-game funds. While a USG Ishimura T-shirt is available for free, the cost of the full bundle has drawn criticism for being excessive.</p><p>While this isn't the first collab between Dead Space and Skate, as there was a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-3/cheats/">Isaac Clarke skin in Skate 3</a>, the new bundle has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/1o0usq9/the_state_of_dead_space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continued the debate over microtransaction practices</a>. Some players drew comparisons between the original Skate 3 unlockable and this new version, pointing out that when the costume was free, it felt more like a fun Easter egg than a monetized item. However, others have suggested the new costume's exaggerated cardboard look may be intentional, aiming for a Halloween costume aesthetic rather than a direct replica of Isaac Clarke's iconic armor. Even so, the $35 price tag remains a sore point. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/BlackoutTV_/status/1975646767518536028" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>On the left is Isaac Clarke from Dead Space in Skate 3.

I would definitely have preferred this game to be a traditional, single-player Skate game where everything is included in the purchase price. On the other hand, I've been playing and loving the new Skate. You do get tons of cosmetics for free if the virtual dress-up part of the game is your bag. The biggest downside is that you only get a handful of items for free that are from real skating brands."</p><p>The user went on to say they paid $25 for the Supporter Pack and felt the overall value was strong, citing access to branded items and a surprisingly generous season pass system. "A traditional Skate was never going to happen these days, so if it took being F2P to get made, I'd rather have this than nothing, as there is a lack of good skating games these days."</p><p>Reactions online have reflected a mix of disappointment and cynicism. "Let's hope that one day Dead Space will reach a state as an IP that it isn’t solely relegated to just being a skin in a mediocre always-online game to boost microtransactions," another Redditor wrote.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Another fan on Twitter</a> commented, "You can buy three Dead Space games with that money (and probably three Skate games)." While some appreciate the ongoing crossover between two beloved EA properties, many argue that the current execution--and its pricing--detract from what could have been a celebratory moment for both franchises.</p><p>Still, the pricing has stirred frustration among Dead Space fans in particular, many of whom are disheartened by the franchise's uncertain future. Despite the critical success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/" data-ref-id="1900-6418021">2023 Dead Space remake,</a> EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-no-longer-working-on-dead-space-2-remake-insider-claims/1100-6522552/" data-ref-id="1100-6522552">reportedly shelved plans for a Dead Space 2 remake</a> and a potential Dead Space 4, reassigning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-iron-man-developer-now-working-on-battlefield-too/1100-6522500/" data-ref-id="1100-6522500">developer Motive to the Battlefield franchise</a>.

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has been significantly improved on Nintendo Switch 2 by a new patch that went live this week.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64">a new report shared on X by SuperMetalDave64</a>, the 1.4 update introduces significant visual improvements, including improved texture quality, LOD draw distance, and lighting and fog with less light bleed. Even at a glance, these visual improvements are easily spottable and bring the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game closer to the other console versions of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The newest update 1.4 to Cronos: The New Dawn on Switch 2 is the biggest yet for graphical improvements:</p><p>-Textures Noticeably Improved<br>-LOD Draw Distance Improved<br>-Lighting/Fog Improved (less light bleed)<br>-Item Pick Up Highlight Effect Fixed <br>-Time Reversal Effect Fixed <a href="https://t.co/yxBq2SSrEG">pic.twitter.com/yxBq2SSrEG</a></p></div>— SuperMetalDave64 (@SMetaldave64) <a href="https://twitter.com/SMetaldave64/status/1975335969537860057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>SuperMetalDave64 also shared a quick comparison between the 1.3 version, the new 1.4 version and the max settings PC version of Cronos: The New Dawn. This side-by-side comparison clearly highlights the improvements which make the Switch 2 version a more palatable choice than at launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Paradox has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>&nbsp;expansion by the name of&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, and it's taking things in an Easterly direction later this month.</p>

<p><em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>is the latest major expansion for&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion" rel="nofollow">April's&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em></a>, and it's introducing settings and campaigns that are entirely new to the series, so you're pretty much guaranteed never to have experienced them in a&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>game before.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>will bring "detailed representations of medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia", and each new playable nation will bring brand new mechanics for you to grapple with.</p>

<p>Paradox is promising that this expansion will build on&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>"on a monumental scale", so this isn't just a minor DLC pack; it's a full-throated expansion that should augment your experience with the game significantly.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em><em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>expansion right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>, it's the third major entry in the&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>series of grand strategy games, and like its predecessors, it tasks you with playing as a dynasty and attempting to survive the slings and arrows of Middle Ages politics.</p>

<p>It's proven pretty popular with players, too, racking up <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/crusader-kings-iii-passes-four-million-sales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">four million sales</a> at last count despite being available on Game Pass (although that may not be the boon it once was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">thanks to recent changes</a>).</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crusader-kings-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crusader-kings-iii/9n7gg222gtth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>It's pointless me trying to sum this game up before you've clapped the lips of your eyes around it and taken a long drag. There's a trailer below. Do it now. Nod if you've done so. Right, that was Soul Injector Commando, a video game about shooting some semblance of everyday humanity into the bodies of the billionaires who're behind all of the world's problems.</p>

<p>You are the Soul Injector Commando, brought back from the dead by god themselves and sent to a bunker. All of the rich bellends have been handily lured there by an audacious fake meteorite prank worthy of enshrinement atop the YouTube algorithm until the end of time. You romp through, soul injecting until you can soul inject no more.  </p>
<p>There a nine levels to get through, filled with these malcontents who'll "become normal humans, get normal jobs, and be happy" if you succeed. At your disposal are a number of different weapons and upgrades, fully voice acted dialogue I assume will help you tell them the error of their ways, and time trials to try if you get through a bout of soul injecting and decide you'd like to try that level again.</p><p>And, to be frank, why wouldn't you? I can't see the likes of being assembled by a dino head with six arms, blasting your way through a supermarket while coins flick around and a big bowl guy waves a gloved hand in joy/resignation, or driving a tiny SUV with wings getting old quickly. Ditto splattering execs as a sentient golf ball, encountering what looks like an intergalactic skeletal drummer, or fighting whatever the head thing that pops up around the minute mark is. I've not even mentioned the two-headed butterfly knight creature.</p>
<p>To bring us back down to Earth a bit, Soul Injector Commando's the latest work of developer and artist <a href="https://www.jeremycouillard.com/">Jeremy Couillard</a>, who's got a well-honed knack for the surreal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014570/AlienAfterlife/">AlienAfterlife</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188760/JEF/">JEF</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1506080/Fuzz_Dungeon/">Fuzz Dungeon</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164310/Escape_From_Lavender_Island/">Escape From Lavender Island</a>, and the snappily-named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789380/Sometimes_to_Deal_with_the_Difficulty_of_Being_Alive_I_Need_to_Believe_There_Is_a_Possibility_That_Life_Is_Not_Real/">Sometimes to Deal with the Difficulty of Being Alive, I Need to Believe There Is a Possibility That Life Is Not Real</a>. They're all now on my wishlist, and not solely because their art styles are 90% made up of things that my uncle's prog rock band would've given anything to put on their album covers.</p>
<p>Soul Injector Commando doesn't have a release date yet. It strikes me as the kind of game that'll just rock up instantly whenever the universe needs it to. Until then, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3220370/Soul_Injector_Commando/">Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>Smartphone upgrades are usually expensive, especially if you’re looking to grab the latest model from top brands like Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, etc. But that’s not the case today.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick a new smartphone for yourself or gift it to a loved one, thanks to Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/"> The retailer has slashed the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB) down to $935 for Prime members and $950 for non-members.</a> That’s up to a massive 28% off. This model comes unlocked and even includes a 1-year U.S. warranty for peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Features Samsung’s Highest-Resolution Ultra-Wide Lens</h2>
<p>In a slim, sleek build, you’re getting a whole bunch of useful features packed inside. There’s a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that makes day-to-day usage both fast and smooth, plus 256GB of storage that lets you keep all your favorites close. This storage capacity sits between the 128GB and 512GB versions, and should be enough for most people, unless you want a beast to store large 4K videos or tons of games.</p>
<p>The 6.9-inch display pushes 2960 x 1440 resolution, so whether you’re streaming or browsing, visuals stay crips and vibrant. Navigation is made super easy with the included S-Pen. Of course, cameras deserve a special mention – it’s Samsung after all. You’ve got the brand’s highest-resolution ultra-wide lens here. The main 200MP wide-angle lens offers incredible clarity, with 2x optical quality zoom. Then there’s a 50MP ultra-wide lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x and 10x optical zoom, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The 12MP front camera keeps your selfies detailed and gram-worthy. Galaxy AI takes your photos and videos to the next level by letting you make quick edits and even clean up background noise for better clips.</p>



<p>The powerful 5,000mAh battery is designed to last an entire day of use, so you won’t have to worry about juicing it up mid-day. Those using a Galaxy smartwatch can enjoy some helpful health and fitness features with the two devices are paired together. And since it’s an unlocked model, you can use it with any carrier of your choice, from T-Mobile to Verizon, Xfinity, and others.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">On a regular day, this smartphone will cost you around $1,300 without any discounts. The current deal lets you grab it for under $950, and the offer applies to several color options.</a> It won’t last long since Prime Day wraps up tonight, so be sure to hurry.</p>

              <p><i>Hades 2</i>, the follow-up to the Nebula-award-winning 2020 roguelike, has finally emerged from Early Access into its hotter, more complete 1.0 self. And what better way to get a sense of how the game sits with folks than by perusing the treasure trove of honesty, snark, and silliness that is the Steam user reviews section?</p> <p><i>Hades 2</i> has generated an interesting dichotomy of perspectives. Positive reviews speak to the joy of this game: engaging gameplay with a gorgeous aesthetic and even more gorgeous characters. Interestingly, negative reviews are most often skewering the ending. We won’t spoil how the game ends here, of course, but it’s worth noting that a common thread among those who soured on <i>Hades 2</i> by the end of it concerns the way it tries to wrap everything up.</p> <p>But sometimes great narrative experiences don’t tie everything together as well as we might hope and yet, as a whole, still deliver a satisfying ride nonetheless. That seems to be <i>Hades 2</i>’s burden: folks are raving about how wonderful of a sequel this is, delivering on so much of what made the original fantastic to play and improving on it. It makes it hard to put down. It’s also clear that this game will make you very horny. But that ending? Might not land well with you.</p> <p>With that, let’s get on with <i>Hades 2</i>, as told by Steam reviews.</p> <h2>Positive Reviews</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000633240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633240"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633240">© Screenshot: Valve / Conga Dispenser / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633242" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633242"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633242">© Screenshot: Valve / Dem-OS / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633243"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633243">© Screenshot: Valve / Eurus Loux / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633245"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633245">© Screenshot: Valve / MurrayUnderStars / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633246" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633246"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633246">© Screenshot: Valve / Caskett / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633247">© Screenshot: Valve / Justicar / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633248" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633248"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633248">© Screenshot: Valve / vladikgir / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633249"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633249">© Screenshot: Valve / Phantom Thieves killed Epstein / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Negative Reviews</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000633250" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633250"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633250">© Screenshot: Valve / JEDUKH / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633251"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633251">© Screenshot: Valve / 17left / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633252"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633252">© Screenshot: Valve / CatsForGold / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633253"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633253">© Screenshot: Valve / EnvyStorm / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633254">© Screenshot: Valve / neon king / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633256" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633256"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633256">© Screenshot: Valve / DjangoBingBango / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633257"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633257">© Screenshot: Valve / Gumbledorf / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000633258" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633258"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633258">© Screenshot: Valve / Hot Paper / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>
