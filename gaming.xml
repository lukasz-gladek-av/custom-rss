			<p>Time Takers is a new PvP third-person action-hero-shooter that was debuted by publisher NCSOFT and developer Mistill Games during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>. Instead of picking one side of combat, where you're either focused on melee or ranged engagements, Mistill Games wants you to have total freedom with how you play. The studio's chief executive officer and the game's director, Yongmin Jo, also calls it giving more players a chance to win "<em>even if your aim isn't perfect."</em></p>



<p>The game was revealed at Gamescom ONL 2025, with its debut trailer focused more on its fantastical setting, which is one where the heroes you play as are pulled from all different corners of time. A medieval-era knight fights alongside a futuristic astronaut monkey and a bionic samurai with insanely powerful robot legs. To call it a mash-up is almost an understatement.</p>



<p>More recently, a new developer video featuring Yongmin Jo digs into the core features of the game, showing how teamwork and the freedom to develop your own strategy is at the heart of real success in Time Takers, as you're constantly racing against the clock, trying to give yourself more time on the battlefield to be the last squad standing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Time Takers | Dev Video : CORE GAME FEATURES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Bvd-iknp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As part of its teamwork focus, the core mechanic in Time Takers is the fact that you are always trying to take more time for yourself and your squad to survive. You'll constantly make decisions around your Time Energy, whether to save it to help you survive for longer, or to use it to charge your abilities and help you be more aggressive in each match.</p>



<p>It seems to be a mechanical way of trying to prevent each match from having a surplus of players that just  try to wait the whole match out and try to win by taking the final two fighting squads by surprise. It's a strategy you could surely employ, but you'd be doing so from a disadvantage, as you've had to spend your energy on staying in the game, instead of trying to win it.</p>



<p>If Time Takers looks like the kind of game you'd want to try, then you'll soon be able to, as there is an upcoming playtest you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/">currently sign up for on its Steam page.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta may be over, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> might also have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-pave-over-battlefield-2042s-bullet-casing-filled-potholes-with-a-road-to-battlefield-6">transformed into Battlefield 6</a>, but there must be more battles in the fields of six, so sign-ups for another round of Labs testing are now open. Two fresh maps with plenty of room for vehicle-based fisticuffs will be on offer, as well as a chance to check out the server browser that may well be chock full of 24/7 scraps once the final game launches.</p>
<p>EA have wheeled out all of this info in two separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">blog</a> <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1961084754091995529">posts</a>, which follow neatly on from them running down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">all of their learnings from the open beta</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the two maps. Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley are set to debut, and if you were among the many miffed at the open beta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-betas-rush-mode-gets-a-balancing-tweak-with-ea-monitoring-the-situation-amid-player-complaints-about-battle-bigness">largely sticking to smaller maps</a>, you'll be glad to hear that they facilitate larger scraps with "a diverse range of vehicles, from quad bikes to tanks and aircraft".</p>
<p>As you might expect, their inclusion's part of EA working to ensure "balancing occurs across different-sized environments" following the open beta. "Improvements to weapons, large-scale vehicular combat, gadget balancing, and more" are all on the publisher's radar to monitor and tweak. This round of testing'll  also be used to lock in "the official setting for Hardcore mode", so put on your best killing pants.</p><p>If you hop into this latest Labs test, you'll also get your first chance to muck around with a work-in-progress version of Battlefield 6's server browser. Its features will be "intentionally limited" so EA can focus on making sure it's stable and useable at a basic level. Basically, making sure folks can set up a server via a shortcode, fill out its description and tags, then host away trouble-free as other players join and leave.</p>
<p>Those who've grown up jumping into 24/7 servers that serve you one map on repeat and don't disappear when everyone goes to bed at the end of the first day will be glad to know EA have confirmed custom servers will be persistent. It won't cost you any extra over the base price of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> either, which is a nice bit of non-money-grabbing from EA, and should mean Battlefield 6 has less trouble establishing a strong sense of community out of the gate.</p>
<p>If you've not taken part in any Battlefield 6 Labs tests to this point, you can <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">head here to sign up</a>. Though, there's no guarantee you'll be granted access either right away or at all, as the spots are much more limted than the open beta.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Dragonite, Victreebel, and more old Pokémon are finding new life in the upcoming RPG
                </p><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is shaking up the series’ formula in more ways than one when it launches in October. It’s got real-time combat, it all takes place in one city rather than an entire region, and it has a new take on multiplayer to take advantage of that new battle system. Even with all this newness, perhaps the most exciting thing Game Freak is adding is more of something old: Mega Evolutions. These superpowered temporary transformations have long been one of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746"><span>favorite battle gimmicks</span></a><span> from over the years, and since we’re heading back to Kalos, their region of origin, what better time than now to add a wave of new Mega Evolutions? A list of possible new forms </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>leaked earlier this year</span></a><span>, and so far it seems to be accurate. Here are all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Dragonite</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Start a New Story in Lumiose City with Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWDx1omjIwM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Mega Dragonite was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682"><span>the first new form</span></a><span> revealed for </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. It emphasizes traits from its pre-evolution, Dragonair, by including a jewel on its tail and adding wings to the sides of its head. It maintains its Dragon/Flying typing, but becomes exceptionally faster and stronger in this form. Mega Dragonite views taking out an enemy quickly as an act of kindness, and has a jolly big smile when it uses powerful attacks because it knows all this violence will be over soon. It’s basically Superman.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Victreebel</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Victreebel Raises a Stink! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f79j5pSboEQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>used a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>spooky found footage video</span></a><span> to reveal Mega Victreebel, but if you take it out of that environment, it is one of the goofier looking Mega Evolutions in the series. The pitcher plant Pokémon’s body has become so engorged with acid that it ties one of its own vines around its throat in order to contain all of it within its bulbous stomach. Now it hops around on its belly as it stalks its prey and loosens the grip around its neck when it needs to projectile vomit its acid onto an enemy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mega Hawlucha</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Hawlucha Makes a Comeback! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>Hawlucha’s new Mega form</span></a><span> is probably the most straightforward one we’ve seen thus far. It gets buff like it’s been downing creatine, dons a new mask and cape combo, and its feathers form a belt around its waist. Mega Hawlucha also gets a signature move called Flying Press that it used on Machamp in its reveal cinematic.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far. Game Freak will no doubt reveal more between now and when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Will Mega Raichu be among them, or will I be made to suffer </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>another slight for my favorite electric rodent</span></a><span>? We all know the answer. I don’t need you to rub it in.</span></p>

      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [65 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> I update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue,” will launch on September 10, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [203 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-988935"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As players conclude their journey through Natlan, they can now set sail north to explore Nod-Krai’s three island territories and meet its inhabitants. In the new Archon Quests, Travelers will join Lauma of the Frostmoon Scions in the fight against the Fatui, stand alongside Flins to resist the relentless “Wild Hunt,” and encounter new allies in Nasha Town. The Fatui’s plot to claim the moon’s power comes to light with the arrival of the Fatui Harbinger, “Marionette,” also known as Sandrone. Meanwhile, Columbina—once known as another Harbinger, “The Damselette”—has withdrawn to her birthplace in Nod-Krai, where she is revered as the Moon Maiden. Meeting her may grant Travelers powerful blessings for their journey. To begin their adventure in Nod-Krai, players can unlock the region after completing Mondstadt’s main story and reaching Adventure Rank 28, or continue into the new Archon Quests after finishing Liyue’s storyline.</p><p>In Nod-Krai, an ancient elemental force known as Kuuvahki permeates the land, shaping both its terrain and its living beings. Players can draw upon this power, hidden within plants, mechanisms, and even the land itself, to overcome challenges in exploration. They may also take on the form of a unique elemental lifeform, the Kuuhenki, gliding swiftly along small patches of mist and Moonlanes. In battle, Kuuvahki reveals itself in both enemies and allies, requiring Travelers to devise targeted strategies to prevail—and granting certain characters the ability to unleash special Lunar Reactions.</p><p>In Version Luna I, three new characters from Nod-Krai will join the playable roster. Lauma, the Moonchanter and a five-star Catalyst wielder, introduces the new Lunar-Bloom reaction with her Dendro powers. Utilizing the Verdant Dew, a special resource generated from the Lunar-Bloom reaction, she can boost her team’s Bloom-related damage. With her unique bond with animals, she can even take on a half-human, half-deer form to sprint and leap with agility. Flins, a five-star Polearm wielder, commands Electro with Lunar-Charged strikes—unleashing either a devastating single blow or a storm of spear attacks. As an experienced Lightkeeper, he can also hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration. Meanwhile, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore wielder and creator of Ineffa, brings both mechanical ingenuity and a touch of home. Her workshop and inventions, including the duck-shaped combat device “Knuckle Duckle,” add playful new interactions to the adventure. Players can recruit Aino to their party for free by progressing through the new Archon Quests in Nod-Krai.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_988936"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The new feature “Meeting Points” will let players step into the daily lives of their companions: relive the legends of the Frostmoon Scions with Lauma, explore the bustling Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop with Aino and Ineffa, or uncover the long-kept stories of the Lightkeepers at Flins’s home. In Version Luna I, the first half will feature Lauma alongside Nahida’s rerun in the Event Wishes, together with a Sumeru-themed Chronicled Wish. The second half brings Flins, Aino, and Yelan’s rerun.</p><p>New optimizations and rewards are set to make your adventure even smoother. Adventure EXP can now be earned through more diverse means, speeding up leveling progress, while harvestable materials will be added to the Battle Pass rewards. In this version, you’ll be able to preview the locked affix of an Artifact in advance and save more team presets with the expanded party setup slots. The biggest change comes with the introduction of Masterless Stella Fortuna, an item that lets you convert the extra 5-star Stella Fortuna to push characters beyond the current cap—all the way to Level 100. And to celebrate both the update and Genshin Impact’s 5th Anniversary, there’s a whole lineup of rewards waiting: a free 5-star character of your choice from the Standard Wish pool, Intertwined Fate ×10 from the login event, Primogems ×1,600 via in-game mail, two special Nod-Krai–themed gadgets, and more.</p><p>Additionally, Genshin Impact announced more details of “Miliastra Wonderland,” the much-anticipated UGC Gameplay System that will allow players to create and enjoy stages made by fellow gamers. Equipped with the “Miliastra Sandbox” editor tool, creators can harness Genshin Impact’s existing systems and assets to design and share a wide variety of fresh experiences, ranging from simulations and party games, to survival challenges and more. Starting with Version Luna II, Miliastra Wonderland will become available, expanding Genshin Impact’s gameplay in bold new ways.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,825 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,303 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

            <p>
Steam users in the UK must now verify their age in order to access store pages for games with mature content, as required by the Online Safety Act.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has released instructions</a> for UK users to opt in using credit card details, which will trigger a £0 authorisation. In the UK, you must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card.
</p>
<p>
"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the instructions read.
</p>
<p>
Valve stated this process "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" in comparison to other age assurance mechanisms. For instance, another mechanism would be using AI to visually identify if a user is over 18.
</p>
<p>
"The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience," Valve continued. "The verification process therefore provides no information about a user's content preferences to payment providers or other third parties."
</p><p>
This requirement on Steam comes as a result of the UK's new Online Safety Act, which is aimed at making the internet safer for children, but regulator Ofcom now requires age verification across all sites and platforms with adult content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first anniversary for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is upon us next week, and Saber and Focus are marking the moment by revealing the contents of the big anniversary update to the hit Warhammer 40K shooter, and sharing a roadmap for Year 2 of the game’s post-launch support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Update 10 for Space Marine 2 arrives next week on 4th September, and it includes a new PvE mission, a new Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode, a new PvP arena, a new Stratagems PvE mode, three new weapons, the Chaos Spawn enemy, and a Chaos armour pack. Phew!</p>
<p>This marks the start of Season Pass 2 as well, which will add the Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack.</p>


<p>But that is just the beginning. The pace of updates will slow from monthly to two a quarter for the year ahead, but the further to the anniversary update we will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 new Operations &amp; a new Siege map</li>
<li>2 new Eternal War arenas</li>
<li>More Stratagems (PvE) content</li>
<li>New playable class: The Techmarine</li>
<li>New weapons and free unlockable weapon variants for existing weapons</li>
<li>New enemies and bosses</li>
<li>New Progression mechanics</li>
</ul>

<p>More fan-favourite Space Marine Chapters will then get representation with he Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons and further cosmetics for the Blood Angels and Salamanders, all bundled into the Season Pass.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

              <p>Playing video games with over-the-ear headphones feels like a wholly different experience than just having the audio play through your TV speakers. The word “immersion” gets tossed around so easily these days, but I get it. Having you game sound pumped right into your ears is a more immersive experience. If you don’t have a pair, you can actually get yourself a wireless gaming headset for not too much money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III which normally goes for $150 just dropped by 33% at Amazon.</a> That shaves $50 off the price, bringing what you pay down to only $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>The audio of the HyperX Cloud II gaming headset is strong</strong>. It’s got angled 53mm drivers designed to optimizing your listening experience while gaming. Hear the pitter-patter of enemy footsteps so no one can get the jump on you when playing ranked.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfort Is King</h2>
<p>The HyperX Cloud IIIs are a comfortable wear. The HyperX signature memory foam all along the headband softens and spreads out the pressure along your crown so you won’t get that weird pain some headsets can cause after a long wear. The ear cushions are plush, wrapped in a premium faux leather which serves the purpose of keeping your ears cozy and locking in the sound.</p>
<p>Any wireless headset worth it’s salt needs good battery life. There ain’t no point in going wireless if you always need to plug it back in to charge after just a couple Victory Royales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III is a behemoth of power.</a> This thing can last you up to 120 hours on a single charge. That’s five full days of battery. So long has you make a habit of plugging it back in every couple of weeks when you’re done, you’ll never have to worry about not having a charge to play. If your gaming sessions are lasting longer than five days, please see a doctor.</p>



<p>Not in a party chat? Just playing some solo runs of <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> or something of the like? Go ahead and pop off the detachable microphone to get it out of the way. When you are in those chats and using the microphones, you can expect high-quality audio with clear voice coming through and going out. The mic is noise-cancelling with a built-in mesh filter to ensure your squad mates only hear your voice and not any disruptive noises in the background.</p>
<p>The headset is durable with it’s flexible aluminum frame. It can travel easily without worry and if you’re prone to accidentally knocking your stuff off your coffee table when you walk by, it should be just fine.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is NBA 2K26 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-xbox-game-pass/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September is a huge month for sports games with several big titles on the horizon, with NBA 2K26 among those poised for launch, and we’ve got the details on whether Game Pass subscribers have access to the game.</p>



<p>Releasing fully on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, though it’s available from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29 for those with early access</a>, NBA 2K26 is the latest entry in the long-running franchise and is always among the most popular games every year.</p>



<p>With September stacked full of big releases, a Game Pass subscription can save you some money, and we’ve got details on whether the service includes NBA 2K26.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-nba-2k26-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play NBA 2K26 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, NBA 2K26 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 5th.</strong></p>



<p>NBA 2K26 is not an Xbox first-party title, which would see it immediately made available through the service. Unlike rivals EA Sports, there’s no free trial period with a Game Pass subscription either.</p>



<p>Although the first wave of titles launching on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September is yet to be announced, NBA 2K26 is a huge release and, if it were to be on the service, we’d have been told by now. On top of this, the Xbox Store page would have a button that states the title would be ‘Coming to Game Pass’ alongside the purchase option.</p>



<p>With no such announcement and no Game Pass badge on the store page, the game will definitely not be on the service at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-nba-2k26-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will NBA 2K26 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>NBA 2K26 could come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, although no official word has confirmed this.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a close relationship with Xbox, with a free-play weekend for Game Pass subscribers for NBA 2K25 last year, while NBA 2K24 had a six-month stint on the service previously. </p>



<p>Other 2K titles, like Borderlands, have also regularly appeared on the Game Pass service, and the cycle of sports games usually sees them move to the service in the final few months of their lifespan before the latest release is dropped.</p>



<p>Therefore, if NBA 2K26 is to come to the service, don’t expect it to occur before 2026, unless a free-play weekend or a similar incentive is announced later in the year.</p>



<p>Have you purchased NBA 2K26? What are your thoughts on the game? Let us know during the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<figure><a title="resleriana interview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/612c54c0bbac5/resleriana-interview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gust Corporation's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-atelier-games-on-nintendo-switch"><strong>Atelier</strong></a> series has been on the go now since 1997. Yes, that 1997, the one that was ages ago.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this is one RPG franchise that's never been a massive mover in the West. It didn't officially see the light of day over here until 2004, after which, I think it's fair to say, it spent quite a long time being so niche in its offerings that the idea of it really taking hold seemed far-fetched. It's all very low stakes, low-key, and incredibly fan-servicey.</p>
<p>However, it's been very interesting — speaking as someone who's reviewed many of the games on Switch 1 — to watch how quickly the Gust devs have, in the past six years or thereabouts, started to appeal to a different, bigger audience, particularly since the genuinely fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_ryza_secret_trilogy_deluxe_pack">Atelier Ryza</a> trilogy released and went from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the first of Ryza's adventures, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_ryza_ever_darkness_and_the_secret_hideout" title="Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout">Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout</a>, was a slight but meaningful shift in the right direction, with a more explorable world, better mission structure, improved combat and a bunch of other Good Things™, by the time the final entry arrived in 2023, it felt like a proper full-on shift from often-difficult-to-parse fare and fan service to the sort of RPG that I (and I'm sure a bunch of other folk) want to get stuck into.</p>

<p>The core alchemy in these games has always been entrancing - this is some super-deep stuff for folks who like to get into ingredients. But this core is now hugely enhanced by modern open worlds, gloriously fun combat, and things that make for a full loop of gaming goodness, rather than what often felt like half of one.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all of this? Well, with the arrival of the next entry in the series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>, just around the corner, I got the opportunity to fire off some quick questions to none other than <strong>Junzo Hosoi</strong> (head of Gust Corporation and the game's general producer), <strong>Yasunori Sakuta</strong> (its development producer), and <strong>Yuki Katsumata</strong> (its director)...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (PJ O'Reilly):</strong> <strong>There are now a total of 27 Atelier games in this fantastic series, including [this one]. This huge number of games is then further divided into several sub-series - tell us how Atelier Resleriana fits into all of this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> The mobile version of Atelier Resleriana stands as the 25th entry to the series (A25). As for this title, as it features events that take place at the same time ones in the first part of Atelier Resleriana (A25), it is considered within a part of A25, so we think of it as "A25-2".</p>

<p><strong>The first Resleriana took the very different form of a mobile Gacha game. What was the decision behind choosing this form of game, and how did it work out overall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yasunori Sakuta:</strong> The mobile version of Atelier Resleriana was created with the intent to allow users who didn't know the Atelier series to casually get in touch with it and discover the appeal of the series. As a result, a lot of people within and outside of Japan mentioned that it became the reason they discovered the Atelier series and their interest in Resleriana is what made them decide to play other Atelier titles.</p>
<p><strong>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian is set within the same universe as the first Resleriana game. Can you tell us what the main differences are for this new adventure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yasunori Sakuta:</strong> This game takes place within the same setting as the previous Resleriana, so we partially used its system as reference. However, this is a completely new title, with a plot that takes place within the same timeframe as the mobile game, but in a different region.</p>
<p>For those who have played the mobile game, I'd think of it more as a "spin-off" of sorts. These players will be able to see connections to the original game, but those who have never played the mobile version can experience this game as a completely new title.</p>
<p><strong>Several Atelier games feature dual protagonists, such as the pair we find in this new game, and in others (Escha and Logy, for instance). What are the main attractions, benefits, and drawbacks of having dual protagonists in this type of adventure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> There hasn't been a male protagonist in the Atelier series in the last few years, so we wanted him to have an active role this time. That's how Rias and Slade were born.</p>
<p>With two protagonists we were able to fully illustrate their relationship, allowing for a more immersive experience. At the same time, if the balance between the two of them is not properly done, only one will be active and the other will not stand out. So that's quite a difficult situation to handle. It was quite challenging to keep the balance between the two protagonists throughout the story and game system.</p>

<p><strong>Is Atelier Resleriana planned to be a trilogy, or are there any future plans for this particular sub-series going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> We are focused on Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian and are not currently thinking ahead. Of course, we are considering the next title for GUST, and there's the possibility of considering a third title for Resleriana.</p>
<p><strong>I am a huge fan of the Atelier Ryza series, which you were producer on. Those games felt like they were pulling the Atelier franchise into a more mainstream position, in how they dialled back fan-service and made the games more “modern JRPG”-like. Does Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian attempt to further the franchise in this way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> Thank you very much! I'm so glad to hear that!</p>
<p>For me, Ryza was a challenging title, as we wanted it to make more people play the Atelier series. And we continued that flow with Yumia. But, during the establishment of the series, I also understand that there are many different needs. For the development for this title, we wanted to make it a series that carefully envelops the turn-based aspects and a kind world.</p>

<p><strong>Atelier Yumia took the series to another level in terms of its open world. Can we expect something similar here, or is this a different sort of experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yuki Katsumata:</strong> This time, the field is not an open world but players will have a sectioned area to explore, similar to Atelier Sophie 2. Additionally, there are multi-level dungeons called "Dimensional Paths" around the field. The map's structure changes every time players enter them and the gimmicks and monsters also change slightly. The obtainable ingredients there are also better than the ones regularly found in the field, so players can also challenge themselves by re-entering them time and time again.</p>
<p><strong>[This] Atelier Resleriana is releasing on Nintendo Switch and a few other, more powerful platforms. Can we expect to see a Switch 2 port at any point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> As this title was developed for the Switch, we currently have no plans to port it to Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of Switch 2, do you have one yet and, if so, have you any favourite games so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> I do own a Switch 2! The recently released Donkey Kong Bananza is really fun. I return to a childlike state to destroy and release my stress!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, and something which has been causing a lot of controversy recently, AI and its many uses within the production of video games. How do you feel about using the likes of generative AI to help on projects, whether it be for background tasks or something like the art or writing in a project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> I feel the application of AI in game creation is incredibly vast. That being said, I think creators play an essential part of it, which is doing what AI cannot do, such as coming up with new ideas and bringing them to life. Moving forward, the balance between what we can leave up to AI and what creators come up and bring to life may become essential in game production.</p>

<p><em>Sincerest thanks to Junzo Hosoi, Yasunori Sakuta, and Yuki Katsumata from Gust Corporation for taking the time out to answer my questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian releases on Switch on 26th September.</em></p>

		<p>“I don't think enough people are across just how catastrophic an entire generation being raised on Roblox and Fortnite is going to be for the ENTIRE video game industry, not just the AAA end,” wrote <em>Aftermath</em> editor (and Sports! guest) Luke Plunkett on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lxgdgk5mrs2h?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Bluesky</u></a> recently. “These kids have no interest in playing or paying for anything else. And they're not ‘growing out of it.’”</p><p>I think this sentiment is common, and the angst and handwringing about what Roblox’s influence will mean for games is understandable given there are only two kinds of headlines:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107383/roblox-just-recorded-more-concurrent-players-at-once-than-all-of-steam/index.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Roblox just recorded more concurrent players at once than all of Steam</u></a></li></ul><p>And…</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roblox-online-gaming-giant-child-predator-allegations-lawsuits-2025-8?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Roblox accused of being a 'hunting ground' for child predators as legal firestorm against gaming giant intensifies</u></a></li></ul><p>Roblox is huge in many senses of the word. It’s played by most children—and also, it's true, brings them a lot of joy! It happens almost every day in my own house with a nine-year-old and five-year-old and they are, like <em>most</em> kids who use Roblox, fine. But my approval of Roblox in the house doesn’t take away from noting it’s also undeniably dangerous, both in the exposure it gives to potential predators and the way it tries to pickpocket their money with trivial microtransactions.&nbsp;</p><p>You're also, in many ways, just describing navigating modern internet platforms. Similar concerns exist across many of them. It sucks.</p><p>The former gets the headlines, but I gotta say, the latter is what gives headaches. You cannot enter a Roblox “experience” without being aesthetically assaulted by pop-ups demanding that you pay a few dollars for basic parts of playing a video game, like checkpoints. Hey Congress, do something useful and block companies like Roblox from targeting kids like this, okay?</p><p>In our house, the policy is that we don’t pay for in-app transactions in Roblox. The kids aren’t even allowed to buy “robux” gift cards with their own money. We just don’t engage. There have been a few exceptions, like buying access to a special room full of exclusive clothes in the <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/who-makes-dress-to-impress-on-roblox?utm_source=publication-search"><u>popular (and well-designed, importantly) dress up game <em>Dress to Impress</em></u></a>. I also bought a cosmetic that let both kids look like a Labubu. Both were harmless. Both were exceptions.</p><p>Sorry, we gotta back up for a second and explain the “experience” thing. It’s hilarious.</p><p>Roblox is full of games. <em>Games</em>. But Roblox doesn’t call them games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440737/roblox-metaverse-game-experiences-apple-epic-trial/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>to skirt Apple’s App Store guidelines</u></a>. (What Roblox <em>users</em> define as a “game,” however, is the more important distinction.)</p><p>Bizarre, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, Roblox is going to completely change video game design. But it’s also a situation where we can replace “Roblox” with “<em>Minecraft</em>,” if you want. You can swap it for <em>Fortnite</em>, too. The trends match.</p><p>Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em> are, to many young people, the equivalent of Steam. It’s not a game, it’s a platform. You log on to find out what the new trending thing is that everyone is playing, much like you’d open up Netflix and scroll through the service’s top 10 lists to find a decent time waster. The kinds of games that appear on these platforms often resemble the games that you and I obsess over, but under the surface, they’re operating in fundamentally different ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, a colleague asked me “Are Roblox games good games?”</p><figure><figcaption><span>The art style is awful. That, sadly, is unlikely to change. We must call for a revolution.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The answer is complicated and comes with bias towards past and current game design history as being forever lessons in the way video games should be designed. The way it will always be.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day-game-freely-without-outlets-2000621092</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-25-000mah-laptop-power-bank-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day-game-freely-without-outlets.1283907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe someone challenged Anker to see just how much power and potential they could pack into a portable charger that’s only 6 inches long and weighs a scant 1.3 pounds. There’s really no other logical explanation for <strong>the Anker Laptop Power Bank, a 25,000mAh universally compatible behemoth with that can charge up to 4 devices at a time.</strong></p>
<p>Could this be the best portable charging device of all? Four-device capabilty, two built-in cables including one that doubles as a carrying strap, able to charge an M3 MacBook Air from zero to 50% in just 21 minutes, and the winner of an iF Design Award and a Red Dot Design Award in 2025? Finding out for yourself has never been easier now that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">Amazon’s running a limited-time 30%-off deal that drops the Anker Laptop Power Bank to just $94.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges Everything, Fast</h2>
<p>The Anker Laptop Power Bank can charge four devices in total, and even with three devices connected for some juice — including a laptop — all three get up to 100W at the same time. Two of the three USB-C ports have dedicated built-in cables, thus eliminating that mad scramble to find one when you’re on the go or in a hurry. One of those built-in USB-C cables extends up to 2.3 feet and can retract back into the body of the Power Bank, while the other doubles as a carrying strap. That’s a lot of cable-bending, so it’s good that Anker has built both cables to endure over 20,000 bends and retractions.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter which device you’re looking to charge — the Anker Laptop Power Bank works with Mac and Windows laptops, smartphones, tablets, and wireless earbuds and headphones from Apple, Samsung, Google, or any brand that’s USB-C compatible, and also Steam Decks and other handheld gaming consoles. The fourth port is USB-A, so older devices aren’t getting left out.</p>



<h2>See It Work</h2>
<p>The hi-res real-time display screen at the front of the Anker Laptop Power Bank gives you all the information you could possibly need, including the output and input wattage for all four ports, remaining charge time, and the temperature and health of the Laptop Power Bank itself. The Laptop Power Bank takes its own temperature and those of the devices it’s connected to 3 million times per day, basically eliminating any chance of an excessive-heat-related failure. It’s TSA approved, so it’s the ultimate travel accessory to keep all of your devices up and running.</p>
<p>There’s a very solid case to be made that the Anker Laptop Power Bank is indeed the very best portable charger on the market. The combination of compact size, power output, number of devices it can charge, built-in cables, and safety measures is unparalleled, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">now during Amazon’s limited-time 30% off deal, so is the $94 price.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong is the type of gaming event that doesn’t come around very often. If you’re excited to get your hands on the sequel and you own a Nintendo Switch 1 or 2 console, let’s check if you can buy Silksong.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a long time coming—and that’s one of the biggest understatements of 2025. It’s been in development for years, its rabid fanbase is desperate for the sequel, and by the end of its run, the original Hollow Knight had launched on multiple platforms. </p>



<p>With exclusivity, consoles, and hardware up in the air more than ever, you might be wondering if Hollow Knight: Silksong is on the Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, both, or worst-case, neither!</p>

<figure><figcaption>Time to Switch things up. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is still coming out for the original Nintendo Switch 1 console, despite its aging hardware.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo is remaining steadfast in its desire to support the Switch 1. Its 150 million-plus lifetime sales suggest there’s plenty of potential for any game to succeed on it. Not everyone upgrades to the new gen right away—which is understandable given the console’s considerable price tag.</p>



<p>This is why <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> deserves a Nintendo Switch 1 release. It may not run as smoothly as it will on other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-platforms-ps5-xbox-pc-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms—such as the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC</a>, for instance—but you should be able to enjoy the fruits of Team Cherry’s years of hard labor and toil.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 owners also get to play Hollow Knight: Silksong when it launches on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>It’s going to become a common theme moving forward. The Switch 2 will be the de facto home for Nintendo players. It’ll eventually become a case of wondering if the game is also coming to the first Switch instead of the Switch 2. We’ve already seen the likes of Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza skip out on the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This is only the beginning, I can assure you. On the other hand, the Switch 1 has plenty of life left, so don’t worry about missing out on big third-party games anytime soon! Enjoy Hornet and her adventure across Hallownest&nbsp;on both Nintendo Switch consoles and see what the hype is all about.</p>

However, there's been discontent in the FF14 community lately over the removal of a popular mod, which led to the game's subsequent review-bombing on Steam. Now, director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the mod controversy with an appeal to players.</p><p>Yoshida's complete remarks were <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/1e4a8b0e8b84ea8dac61ae07af02e0c425de74aa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on FF14's official site</a>, and he requested that excerpts from his statement not be used by media outlets. But since his response was nearly 2,000 words, a concise recap is unavoidable. The issue started when Square Enix's lawyers sent a letter to modder DarkArchon regarding Mare Synchronos, a mod that allowed players' customized avatars to be visible outside of their own game. Once Mare Synchronos was removed at Square Enix's request, some fans <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/why-final-fantasy-xiv-fans-are-review-bombing-the-game-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their fury in the form of negative Steam reviews</a>.</p><p>Although Yoshida notes that he tolerates mods and has admiration for some fan-made creations, he's against mods that violate the game's intent or design in a negative manner. As a potential example, Yoshida noted that Square Enix could face legal consequences in some countries over nude character mods on display in the game. He also cited customized appearances that mimic paid content from from the game as an example of devaluing the services and collectibles that Square Enix sells to provide the revenue the game needs to remain financially viable.</p><p>Yoshida concluded his statement by saying he respects the tradition of modding in PC games, but he also requests that players do so while respecting the rules and integrity of FF14.</p><p>Late last year, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-free-to-play-will-kick-off-with-a-realm-reborn/1100-6527979/" data-ref-id="1100-6527979">expanded Final Fantasy 14 into the mobile realm</a> and released the game's fifth expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Dawntrail</a>. More recently, Yoshida has shared his intent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-support-on-ps4-looks-uncertain-but-yoshi-p-is-working-to-keep-it-going/1100-6534307/" data-ref-id="1100-6534307">to make sure Final Fantasy 14 remains compatible with PlayStation 4</a> as long as possible. However, he added that the limitations of the PS4 hardware may make that less feasible going forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like always, this year's Gamescom was accompanied by a slew of new game announcements. Among the new games revealed during one of the most important video gaming events of the year was <a href="https://valormortis.game/">Valor Mortis</a>, a first-person soulslike in development by One More Level, the Polish development studio known for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> series. Having appreciated some of the features of the first entry in the series, such as the amazing mobility of the main character and its uncompromising approach, but not being particularly keen on how restrictive the entire experience felt, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the new game, which looked at a glance like another take on the formula with an underused setting in video games. My first impression of the game was not only completely off the mark but turned upside down completely when I finally got to spend more time with it.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, Valor Mortis is a first-person soulslike where players take on the role of William, a soldier in the Grande Armée brought back from the dead to continue serving Napoleon and save Europe from the mysterious plague that is destroying the continent, corrupting its inhabitants beyond repair. The premise alone is more than enough to set the game apart from every other souslike on the market, as not only the setting is really unique, but the first person gameplay seems to harken back to the days of the King's Field series back when FromSoftware was still refining the formula that the studio would make popular with Demon's Souls and the first Dark Souls.</p>



<p>Going the soulslike route with their new game, One More Level doesn't seem to have forgotten its past games, as Valor Mortis' smooth gameplay has some echoes of the Ghostrunner games' experience. Controlling William is extremely smooth, and the experience feels past paced without being on steroids like in the studio's older franchise, as combat still retails the heaviness and positioning focus of a soulslike. What I really enjoyed in Valor Mortis is how the first-person perspective is allowing the developer to nail how proper soulslike combat encounters should be - duels, or fights against a smaller number of enemies - going the opposite direction of many developers who prefer to overwhelm the player with huge enemy numbers using a combat system not really suited for big enemy numbers. </p>

<p>Following a few minutes of adjustments to the new perspective, I was immediately hooked to the experience, fighting enemies with short-range weapons and guns, unleashing special abilities, dodging, and parrying attacks with ease. Ultimately, the experience seems to strike a good balance regarding challenge, but as the game is still far from release, it is difficult to say how challenging Valor Mortis will actually be. In terms of level design, Valor Mortis also seems to be on point. The devasted battlefield where the Gamescom demo was set featured an intricate design with plenty of shortcuts and alternate paths, including some optional locations featuring powerful enemies, so it feels like One More Level is placing a decent amount of focus on traversal as much as it is on combat.</p>



<p>After taking down many corrupted soldiers and dying a few times in the process, I reached a massive corrupted soldier who served as the demo's final boss. Comprised of two phases, this boss fight put my limited knowledge of the Valor Mortis mechanics to the test, offering another look at how guns can be used to hit weakpoints and make some fights a little easier. After learning the boss' attack patterns, parrying and dodging accordingly, I managed to take it down with a few minutes to spare, which a member of the development team used to show me another enemy encounter where the player can use ranged weapons to destroy the cannon carried by the enemy to deal tons of damage. Sadly, my time with Valor Mortis ended right after this small additional showcase, leaving me hungering for more.</p>



<p>In a market becoming a little saturated with average soulslike that fail to capture what makes this sort of game so compelling, Valor Mortis feels like a breath of fresh air, as No More Level has shown, with this demo, to understand what a proper soulslike should feature. As such, the game was easily one of the best I had the pleasure of trying during this year's Gamescom, and one I really cannot wait to get my hands on the final game. Thankfully, some players won't have to wait until the game releases next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S to experience for themselves what makes Valor Mortis such a good game, as a playtest will be conducted soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-reveals-creature-collecting-auto-chess-game-honkai-nexus-anima.1283886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>sub-series, and if you're a fan of creature-collecting strategy games, then&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>is one you'll want to check out.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be building bonds with creatures made of Anima, unlocking abilities that embody their "unique concepts", and engaging in strategic combat using "diverse battle tactics".</p>

<p>By the looks of things,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-surprise-riot-makes-teamfight-tactics-permanent-league-of-legends-mode" rel="nofollow"><em>Teamfight Tactics</em></a>-style auto-chess game, but you'll also be tasked with exploring the world around you and uncovering "the mysteries of the protagonist's past", which is becoming a bit of a theme for HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-nexus-anima-announced-combat.jpg?itok=_L4YEtZf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-nexus-anima-announced-combat.jpg?itok=W-1RY9Zb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>brings&nbsp;<em>Teamfight Tactics</em>-style auto-chess combat and more to the&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the combat will take the form of auto-chess-style strategy gameplay, the way you'll explore&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>'s world looks a lot closer to traditional HoYoverse stuff; the trailer shows the player exploring a fully-fledged 3D world, engaging in minigames, and exploring with the aid of creature companions.</p>

<p>As such, this is probably gearing up to take the form of a classic HoYoverse-style grab bag of mechanics and gameplay styles, so if you're put off by the auto-chess angle, there'll almost certainly be something else in&nbsp;<em>Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>you'll love.</p>

<p>HoYoverse hasn't specified whether you'll need any prior knowledge of the previous&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>games (namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Impact 3rd</em>) to enjoy this one, but on the basis of&nbsp;<em>Star Rail</em>, it's unlikely you'll need to have played them beforehand.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>in action via the all-new gameplay trailer, which includes a look at things like combat, character creation, and world exploration, right here.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's coming to PC and iOS at some point in the future. If you want a chance to try it out, you can <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up for the closed beta right here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-portable-2tb-hard-drive-is-just-5-more-than-the-1tb-almost-free-insurance-policy-for-gamers-2000621088</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-portable-2tb-hard-drive-is-just-5-more-than-the-1tb-almost-free-insurance-policy-for-gamers.1283883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A catastrophic data loss goes way beyond just losing files. You could have digitized photos or home movies on your hard drive, and if they’re not backed up when your computer meets with a sudden disaster, they’re gone forever. That’s when your data loss becomes a huge ball of emotional stress that you really could do without.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">The $70 price attached to the Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive at Amazon during a limited-time deal</a> might be the least expensive insurance policy you’ll find today, and that’s true for PC and Mac users, and also Xbox and PlayStation gamers. (Because losing game data also sucks.) It’s two terabytes of plug-and-play, cross-platform-compatible peace of mind at an exceptional price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast and Secure</h2>
<p>The Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive works with USB 3.0 for super-fast file transfers of up to 120MB/s, and also with USB 2.0 on older devices. Either way, there’s no app or driver you need to install, and it doesn’t need any external power source. It’s strictly plug-and-play across all of its compatible platforms. The included 18-inch USB 3.0 cable gives you flexibility when it comes to where to set up the drive. (There’s really nothing worse than those cheap 4-inch cables packaged with other drives.)</p>
<p>The Seagate 2TB drive works with automatic backup apps like Apple’s Time Machine, and also as a drag-and-drop interface. If you want to take your data or game files on the go, the Seagate is literally pocket-sized, barely over a half-inch in thickness and exceptionally light, and built sturdily enough that you don’t have to worry about tossing it into a backpack on your way out the door.</p>



<h2>Backup for your Backup</h2>
<p>Things <em>do</em> happen, which is why you’re buying a reliable backup drive in the first place. And if some awful fate were to befall your Seagate drive, it comes with a year of Seagate’s Rescue Service, which depending on the severity of the damage would either repair the drive or extract the data from it and send it back to you on a new drive.</p>
<p>A smart and increasingly common practice is to copy your most precious and/or sensitive data and files onto one drive and store it in a safe location outside of your home, thus covering yourself in case of fire or other natural disaster. At the current $70 Amazon price for the 2TB Seagate Portable Hard Drive, having one emergency backup drive offsite and another to keep with your computer is a smart tactic. But having at least one fast, reliable backup drive is essential, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">head to Amazon now and grab a Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive while it’s on sale for just $70.</a></p>

During the GameCube era, Nintendo's console was home to numerous cult-classic horror games, and Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno wants to see more spine-tingling games released for Nintendo hardware.</p><p>"I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true," Babieno said to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4--were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a golden time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the ones to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now. We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cronos: The New Dawn Could Be The Beginning Of A New Era For Bloober Team</p>
      </div>
<p>Babieno added that Luigi's Mansion could be a good indicator of what fans can expect from the studio, as it gave players a cozy horror experience. The CEO says that there is a "huge possibility to repeat such an idea" in the future.</p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn is one of only a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">handful of horror games that have been announced for the Switch 2</a>. Little Nightmares 3 looks like it'll spike heart rates--in a good way--but so far, it looks like Bloober's upcoming game is the only one that'll offer Switch 2 players a gory and unnerving experience as players travel through time and face off against nightmarish creatures that can merge with each other to gain a fleshy power-up.</p><p>The game will also be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches on September 3. "Cronos has impressed in the two hours I've played it so far, and though I still have questions and will reserve my final judgment for the full game later this year, it's clear the team has found its secret weapon in how it has designed Cronos' combat gameplay," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-tense-like-the-silent-hill-2-remake-but-with-a-twist/1100-6533465/">Cronos: the New Dawn preview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Aside from Grand Theft Auto VI, which was not featured at Gamescom 2025, Resident Evil Requiem is undoubtedly among the most hyped upcoming titles, and the German convention confirmed it. The first public hands-on of the ninth mainline chapter in CAPCOM's horror franchise convinced press and fans alike, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2025-awards-resident-evil-requiem-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by the many Gamescom awards won</a>.</p>



<p>During Gamescom, CAPCOM also discussed Resident Evil Requiem in greater depth throughout a few interviews. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tooB3GgtU8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking with Gamesradar</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi explained that the new game will feel like a complete rollercoaster ride thanks to much greater extremes when it comes to all the classic Resident Evil elements of horror, tension, action, and release.</p>



<p><em>I think the two recent titles, Resident Evil 4 remake and Village, are more on the action side of the series in terms of the mixture of elements that they have. Resident Evil Requiem is something different. If I had to compare it to past titles, it's more along the lines of Resident Evil 7 or the Resident Evil 2 remake. You could call it old school Resident Evil, you know, with exploration and backtracking and that kind of thing. It does, of course, feature all the classic core pillars of Resident Evil features that everyone knows and loves, such as combat, exploration, puzzle solving, resource management of limited number of items, and we've given it our own spin this time for Resident Evil Requiem's game atmosphere.</em></p>



<p><em>Speaking then to Resident Evil 7 and 2, I think they reflect a typical game design that we have for this series, where you can't keep the horror tension to the max through the whole game, because it's quite exhausting. So, you need to have this dynamic pacing curve where you'll have a a very tense, horrific sequence, and then we give you a bit of a release or a catharsis from that and let you come down from that with more slightly peaceful exploration or some exciting comba,t and then we gradually bring you back up the horror part of the curve.</em></p>



<p><em>Again, that's the standard practice for Resident Evil. The difference this time is there's a new system that I can't quite get into yet, but if you think of the difference between the tension and the release being a certain size of wavelength, as it were, of that curve, I want to make the distance between those aspects bigger than ever before in the series, and it just becomes a complete roller coaster ride between the different aspects of the series. I'm very excited for people to eventually understand what I mean by that.</em></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to launch on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support path tracing</a> (the first RE Engine title to do so) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>

			<p>A new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater mod now available for download addresses one of the most critical issues found in the PC version of the game: the 60 FPS framerate cap.</p>



<p>The Better Uncap FPS mod, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/47?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, allows users to cycle between different FPS targets between 30, 60, 100, 120, 144, and uncapped, with the uncapped option being the default. In addition, the mod also features an experimental audio sync fix, disables Depth of Field, Motion Blur, Refraction Blur, Chromatic Aberration, Lens Distortion, Film Grain, and Tonemapper for cleaner and sharper visuals and fully supports Lossless Scaling. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although this new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater mod definitely goes a long way in improving the game, the new options are not enough to completely fix a game released in a rather bad state. Some of its visual elements, such as particle effects, cause some massive performance drops, as highlighted on X by Benchmarking, so it definitely looks like developer Virtuos has <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">a lot of work ahead</a> to fix a game that deserved to be released in a much better state on all platforms.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another issue I noticed in this broken game is that whenever particles (especially dust) spawn near the camera, performance drops significantly. <br>The only solution I found is to disable these particles entirely using:<br>[SystemSettings]<br>fx.EnableNiagaraSpriteRendering=0<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MGSDelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MGSDelta</a> <a href="https://t.co/BJClQuino6">pic.twitter.com/BJClQuino6</a></p>— BenchmarKing (@BMKing23) <a href="https://twitter.com/BMKing23/status/1961089149873623136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2025</a></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is good noise? “Golden” by Hunter/X from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em> is good noise. New episodes of Jamie Loftus’ <em>Sixteenth Minute (of Fame) </em>podcast is good noise. The guns firing in the bank heist scene of Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em> is good noise. What about bad noise? The couple on the bus with you arguing is bad noise. The turbine engines on flight is bad noise. Your cubicle’s neighbor punching away at their mechanical keyboard is bad noise. Wouldn’t it be swell if we could just cancel out the bad noise so we can focus in on the good noise? Well, you can do just that with <strong>the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise cancelling headphones.</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">For a limited time, Amazon has them for a whopping 43% off this labor day weekend. Normally priced at $348, you can currently pick them up for a solid $150 off.</a> That means you only have to pay $198.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones utilize digital noise cancellation to ensure you can hear each and every note or word clearly with no disruptive sounds from your environment coming through. Two microphones in each earcup work together to capture and eliminate surrounding noise when listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks, removing it in real time with the help of the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1.</p>

<p>The noise-cancelling tech also works to amplify your voice during calls. Five microphones work to deliver clear voice quality. They isolate your voice from any background noise so the person on the other end hears you and just you.</p>
<p>The headphones are designed for all day listening. You can expect a full 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. That’ll last you the whole workday, your commute, and beyond. If you ever find yourself having forgotten to charge it, no need to worry. Just plugging it in for 10 minutes will let you listen for a solid five hours.</p>



<h2>Multipoint Connection</h2>
<p>One standout convenience with the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones is that they can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at once. This is great as it allows you to be connected to your phone and a gaming console at the same time. It’s perfect for wanting to listen to your own music or podcasts through Spotify or something while playing a game on your Nintendo Switch. You can take a call without disconnecting and reconnecting anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">Through Labor Day weekend, you can grab yourself a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-cancelling headphones for $150 off.</a> The price is down to just $198 for a limited time.</p>

<p>With September stacked full of huge releases, knowing the amount of time it will take to complete games like Cronos: The New Dawn is important for you to plan effectively, so we’ve got the details on the game length.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn impressed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, but it lands in a packed release schedule that also includes the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong and Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to play multiple new releases in September, we’ve got everything you need to know on the game length of Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Hours to Beat Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>

<p><strong>Cronos: The New Dawn will take around 18 hours to beat, according to the developer themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-developers-reveal-that-it-will-take-around-18-hours-to-beat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech Radar</a> in April, game directors Wojciech Piejko and Jacek Zięba stated that the game was being completed by play tests in 18 hours. However, it was added that it could change as the team was still “balancing everything.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the game length has extended or shortened since, but it should give players a decent indication of how long it will take to progress through the main story. Depending on how you play, it could take up to 20 hours or as little as 16.</p>



<p>If you want to uncover every secret hidden in the game, it will naturally take you longer until you reach the end, but it’s all down to your playstyle.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-cronos-the-new-dawn-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Cronos: The New Dawn Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>The length of a full completionist run in Cronos: The New Dawn has not been stated, although players are encouraged to play through the main story at least twice.</strong></p>



<p>Replaying the game unlocks new skins, access to a higher difficulty option in New Game+, experimenting with the upgrade system, or trying out different approaches. Crucially, the developers have stated the game needs to be played “at least twice to understand most of it.”</p>



<p>Two playthroughs would total around 36 hours, giving you plenty of time to sink into the title, and it’s clear that replayability is a crucial feature.</p>



<p>How many times do you think you’ll play through Cronos: The New Dawn? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
