            <p>
If you could barely contain yourself when Minecraft added a bunch of new pig variants last month, you might want to hold onto something solid: Mojang is back with a brand-new content update for public testing, and this time we're talking <em>cows</em>.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Minecraft's <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/more-minecraft-game-drop-features">latest Java snapshot</a> includes a grand total of two cow variants. You've got your fur-covered cold cows who'll wander around those snow-covered biomes, as well as your warm cows who like to do their grazing in sandy biomes.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, Mojang has also introduced new ambient sounds for desert biomes, which include whispering sand, chirping crickets, rustling twigs, and howling winds. Additionally, players can place a dead bush on two outdoor sand blocks, or cluster sand and terracotta blocks together to bring some of that desert ambience back to their own bases.

<p>
Elsewhere, there's a lot going on in the world of bushes. Java snapshot players can also get acquainted with the new firefly bush, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like - conjuring a dainty swirl of dancing lights around its branches at nighttime. It's found in swamps and other bodies of water, with players able to retrieve the firefly bush and grow it using bone meal back at base if they want to enjoy it closer to home. Additionally, the firefly bush can be placed under a block to give the block above a sparkly effect.
</p><p>
Still in the realm of shrubbery, Minecraft's final addition is the evocatively named "bush" - a new bush found in forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes. This can also be grown in bone meal if you need all the bushes, all the time.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
All the above - as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-adds-new-pig-variants-ambient-falling-leaves-wildflowers-and-more-for-testing">new pig variants, ambient falling leaves, and wildflowers</a> added for testing in January - are available right now as part of Minecraft: Java Edition's latest snapshot, and can be accessed by enabling snapshots in the launcher's "Installations" tab. Mojang notes the new features are coming to Bedrock beta and preview "soon" - and everything currently in testing will get a full release at some point later this year.
</p>
<p>
Mojang hasn't yet said <em>when</em> Minecraft's first full content drop of 2025 is due, but it did previously confirm it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">changing the way it releases new content</a>. Gone is Minecraft's traditional mega-sized summer update, replaced by multiple smaller drops throughout the year.

            <p>Watch out for that falling breezeblock! It's about to-- ah, too late, you've been donked. A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.</p>

<p>Yup, sure looks like a Battlefield game. A rocket is fired into a building, lots of dust and rubble falls down around soldiers, a big tank parks itself helpfully in the middle of the road. </p>
<p>The producers chat from a hypescript for most of the rest of the video and hail from four different studios, all working on the game in some way or another: Dice, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect. We already knew most of what the video covers, including that the shooter will have a single player campaign, and that it'll take place in a modern or near-future setting. </p><p>The only new thing is mention of a program called "Battlefield Labs" in which members of the public can sign up for the chance to playtest the game. It seems like a fancy way of saying "sign an NDA and we'll give you a test build". EA (among other companies) commonly source playtesters from the public like this. Think of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-heelflips-into-my-calendar-with-an-early-access-release-some-time-in-2025">open and ongoing testing</a> done for another EA studio, Full Circle, who like to watch people play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> and presumably take notes when players fall and hurt their little bum-bums. </p>
<p>As for the four-studio unity on display, it is hard to take this display of corporate unity at face value. Criterion's role on the game means that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-have-delayed-need-for-speed-so-criterion-can-support-battlefield-6">plan to work on the next Need For Speed game is postponed</a>. And Electronic Arts did have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">a fifth crowd involved on the campaign</a> at one point - Ridgeline Games, a studio set up by Halo series veteran Marcus Lehto. But EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shuttered that studio last year</a>. So, uh, no mention of them in this promo piece.

                <p dir="ltr">Pump the brakes on expectations for a new Need for Speed anytime soon. That's because Criterion, the developer behind the racing series, is all in on supporting the next Battlefield experience currently. But EA is promising that Need for Speed will return eventually.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a> spoke with Battlefield boss Vince Zampella about Criterion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">which now sits under the Battlefield Studios banner</a>. Of course, that sort of change--with Criterion supporting the single-player experience for the next Battlefield--brings up questions about whether the developer might only be focused on the shooter series going forward.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"The Need for Speed team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield," said Zampella. "As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for Unbound. With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways."</p><p dir="ltr">In September 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfs-burnout-studio-will-work-on-next-battlefield-game-and-also-more-nfs/1100-6517857/" data-ref-id="1100-6517857">EA announced that Criterion was contributing to the next Battlefield game</a>, though it added work would continue with the Need for Speed series. Criterion previously partnered on Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Meanwhile, earlier in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-need-for-speed-developers-form-new-studio-called-fuse-games/1100-6512400/" data-ref-id="1100-6512400">former Criterion developers formed Fuse Games</a> after the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/need-for-speed-unbound-review-comic-book-racing/1900-6418010/" data-ref-id="1900-6418010">Need for Speed Unbound</a>, the last entry in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Criterion became the de facto studio for the racing series with Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit in 2010, followed up by Need for Speed: Most Wanted in 2012. Previously, the developer was best known for creating and overseeing the Burnout franchise. Then, Ghost Games took charge of the franchise, starting with 2013's Need for Speed Rivals and ending with 2019's Need for Speed Heat. EA revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-development-is-moving-back-to-crite/1100-6473648/" data-ref-id="1100-6473648">Criterion was coming back to Need for Speed in 2020</a>, ultimately releasing 2022's Need for Speed Unbound.

<p>NetEase has cracked the live-service element with Marvel Rivals. We’re already looking ahead to Season 2 as everything the developer puts out is a win, so let’s see the early details to see what the developer is cooking up for the second season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is unlikely to be as big and as impactful as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first season was the proper debut, we were still in the early days, and player counts usually tend to fall off as time goes on—no matter how good the game. Still, NetEase has Hulk-smashed it, and January 2025 saw its peak <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count smash the 650,000</a> mark.</p>



<p>That being said, we need to look ahead to the future. The developer needs to keep its foot on the pedal and prioritize retention.</p>

<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t outlined an exact start date, but game director Guangyun Chen’s comments suggest Season 2 could start on April 4.</strong></p>



<p>Guangyun Chen said in an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a> that Season One is a “<strong>three-month-long journey</strong>.” Season 1 launched on Friday, January 10, so if we fast-forward three months (12 weeks), we land on <strong>Friday, April 4</strong>.</p>



<p>There are several factors to consider here though. Firstly, three months can mean January to April, so it’s not necessarily 12 weeks. It could be 13 or 14, so it’s logical conjecture for now. Furthermore, it’s quite common for projected dates to change by a week or two due to delays or rethinks.</p>



<p>I’ve seen countless live-service games delay seasons down the years, and Marvel Rivals is liable to suffer the same fate. Fingers crossed it doesn’t, but we will update you on the latest changes and developments.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-new-hero-leaks-amp-early-details">Marvel Rivals Season 2 New Hero Leaks &amp; Early Details</h2>



<p><strong>A ton of different leaks suggest Marvel Rivals Season 2 is getting two new heroes from a large selection of potential characters including various X-Men heroes and more.</strong></p>



<p>We know Marvel Rivals is guaranteed to get at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Many names have been outed with leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@X0X_LEAK</a> posting <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1872451730652422378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">messages on X</a> concerning heroes in the game’s files.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-x-men-characters-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men characters have leaked</a>—thanks to datamining—and suggestions are that more high-profile names such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool</a> are Marvel Rivals-bound. On the other hand, more reports have come out saying NetEase is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hiding fake heroes in game files to catch leakers</a>.”</p>



<p>It’s hard to say for sure if NetEase is doing this, but if they are, it’s an interesting move. For now, here’s every leaked name, and we’ll see if any of them appear in Marvel Rivals Season Two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Beast</li>



<li>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Deadpool</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Gambit</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jia Jing</li>



<li>Jubilee</li>



<li>Locus</li>



<li>Modok</li>



<li>Nightcrawler</li>



<li>Paste Pot Pete</li>



<li>Phoenix/Jean Grey&nbsp;</li>



<li>Professor X</li>



<li>Rogue</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-2">What To Expect From Marvel Rivals Season 2</h2>



<p>We’re still weeks away from a Marvel Rivals Season 2 content roadmap or NetEase announcements, but it’s safe to assume we’ll get typical live-service content additions: <strong>New maps, heroes, game modes, and Events</strong>.</p>



<p>This is the kind of information we get more of—including leaks—closer to the time. But, it’s fun to speculate, and it’s easy to make educated guesses based on previous content and seasons.</p>



<p>New heroes are assured, as we covered above, but don’t expect the volume of characters we got in Season 1 as this is considered a one-off. New maps are about the most locked-in type of content for any new hero shooter season too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spring-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Spring Festival and Clash of Dancing Lions</a> is an example of the type of events and content Rivals is adding in the future. With Seasons lasting three months, another event or two for Season 2 is a given. We’ll be filling in the blanks as we go on all of this and see if we can borrow Doctor Strange’s powers to see into the future.</p>



<hr>



<p>Details for Marvel Rivals Season 2 are vague right, granted. But it won’t always be the case, and we’ll update you as developments happen. But what do you want to see from the new season? What’s NetEase not getting right in the F2P shooter?</p>

<p>The Need for Speed franchise isn’t dead, it’s just dormant for a while. </p>



<p>EA has confirmed that  it has plans for Criterion Software—developers of 2022’s Need for Speed Unbound and other past racing titles—to return to the franchise in the future. For now, however, the sole focus at Criterion is the next Battlefield game as part of EA’s “Battlefield Studios” team.</p>







<p>“The Need for Speed&nbsp;team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield,” EA’s Vince Zampella&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Eurogamer</a>. “As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for Unbound.</p>



<p>“With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways.”</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Confirms Battlefield Labs Community Testing Platform</a></h6>



<p>Based on the statement, it seems clear that there is no new Need for Speed in development in any way at the studio. That means, if and when it returns, fans are looking at years down the line for its release.</p>



<p>When do you think Criterion will return to developing Need For Speed? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>A color caster for Counter-Strike 2 found himself screaming at a pro player’s mistake, and had to walk away from the desk to cool off. The play and the caster’s reaction occurred at IEM Katowice, one of the biggest tournaments in the yearly CS2 circuit.</p>



<p>What ended up being a terrible series for the player was highlighted by this one unimaginably poor play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-you-doing">‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING?’</h2>



<p>During a match between Team Liquid and The MongolZ, a poor decision from Liquid player Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak drew the ire of former player and long-time CS2 caster Chad “SPUNJ” Burchill. While defending the B site of Mirage in the pistol round, ultimate waited too long to pull the trigger, allowing a teammate of his to die before he himself got taken out. Both SPUNJ and his casting partner Alex “Machine” Richardson were quite frustrated, but SPUNJ let the full anger out.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250203_AcceptableTriangularAirGuitarThisIsSparta-j-dfX8zpT8v4JKDA_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>What ultimate was trying to do was to stay hidden until multiple enemies passed him, so that he could take them all down in quick succession. However, he waited too long to act, and the first player he let by ended up killing his teammate. By the time ultimate lined up the second enemy, the first one noticed him and quickly dispatched him.</p>



<p>Ultimate’s performance in the map prior was clearly a factor in SPUNJ’s outburst, as the Polish player had a <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/191534/the-mongolz-vs-liquid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0.5 K/D</a> in the first map of the series. Following the mishap, SPUNJ remarked that the play was “inexcusable,” especially considering that Liquid had a man advantage. The CS2 caster chose to walk away from the desk and out of the casting room for the second round. Both SPUNJ and Machine got back on track by the end of the third round though.</p>



<p>To make matters worse for ultimate, Liquid lost despite winning map one, and he ended with one of his worst stat lines ever. On a positive note, ultimate played better the next day versus MOUZ, and Liquid is still alive in Katowice.</p>



<p>Was ultimate’s play warrant that big of a reaction from the caster? Let us know what you think down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>EA has given us our first look at gameplay from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next entry in the long-running Battlefield series</a>.</p><p>This gameplay footage came at the end of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Introducing Battlefield Labs</a> video released by EA on Monday morning. That video outlines how DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive are all working together on the next Battlefield and plan on heavily emphasizing player testing throughout the rest of the competitive first-person shooter's development. At the end, we see a sizzle reel of pre-alpha gameplay.</p><p>There's a lot that can be learned from the seven clips shown. We see a large squad of soldiers fighting in various parts of the city. The gameplay looks fairly similar to the more grounded games in the series, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-4/" data-ref-id="5000-147664">Battlefield 4</a>. We see buildings constantly collapsing around players during this shootout, and the final gameplay clip of the video shows a player shooting a building with an explosive weapon and watching it collapse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fGteYuaNxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Destruction has always been a heavily promoted aspect of the Battlefield series, and this latest entry will continue to emphasize that. Vehicles will also play a large part in that destruction, as we see a tank fighting alongside soldiers in the gameplay footage. It's only about 10 seconds of footage, but a lot can already be discerned from it.</p><p>The next Battlefield title does not have a name or release date at this time, as it's still in active development at the pre-alpha stage.

<p>"This patch also resolves a bug that prevented players from getting Achievements," the update explained. "Affected players will unlock those Achievements retroactively after updating the game and loading a save file."</p>
<p>The patch also addresses an issue with DualShock 4 button prompts, and "resolved a frame rate-related progression blocker" in the mission Show Me New York.</p>
<p>The team says it'll continue to keep its collective ear to the ground as the hotfix rolls out and will keep a close eye on its crash reporting system and your feedback.</p> <div>

<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released for PC via Steam and Epic at the end of last week, but just a few days and 5000+ user reviews later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2s-pc-port-is-already-getting-slammed-by-steam-users">it settled on a "mixed" rating on Steam</a> with players reporting bugs, stabilisation issues, and crashes.</p>
<p>Last week, Sony also confirmed it was dropping its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC</a>, but introduced in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-labs-could-let-you-shape-the-next-battlefield-game-through-testing.1098822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and its "collective Battlefield Studios teams" have announced Battlefield Labs, a testing initiative that will allow certain&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>players to test out the new game and provide their feedback during development.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/news/this-is-battlefield-labs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>website, EA describes Battlefield Labs as its "most ambitious community development collaboration ever". The initiative will give players the chance to provide their feedback in order to "validate the future of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>".</p>

<p>So, what exactly will Battlefield Labs entail? Essentially, if you're approved for the program, you'll be testing various elements of the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, like core combat, environment destruction, and "balance and feedback" for features like weapons, gadgets, and vehicles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-labs-announced-bf2042.jpg?itok=Gw27uiy4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-labs-announced-bf2042.jpg?itok=rV4k72SI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battlefield Labs seems like an attempt to avoid another disastrous launch like that of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>EA also says that Battlefield Labs will include tests for the Conquest and Breakthrough gameplay modes, which it describes as "the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience", as well as "pillars" of the franchise like its class system, which was controversially replaced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/battlefield-2042-specialist-system-gamble" rel="nofollow">the Specialist system</a> in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for a chance to join the Battlefield Labs program <a href="https://electronicarts.queue-it.net/?c=electronicarts&amp;e=generalsite&amp;cid=en-US" rel="nofollow">right here</a>, but at time of writing, there are tens of thousands of users in the queue, so be prepared to wait a while before you get your opportunity.</p>

<p>Initially, only "a few thousand participants" will be invited to join Battlefield Labs in Europe and North America, but over time, "tens of thousands more" across "further territories" will get to try the game out.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this doesn't constitute a full announcement of the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, although you can see a few seconds of gameplay in the video EA released as part of the Battlefield Labs announcement. You can check that out here.</p>




<p>It's likely that Battlefield Labs is part of EA's attempt to avoid repeating the disastrous launch of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-bugs-other-issues-plague-launch" rel="nofollow">plagued with bugs and other problems</a> at launch, as well as missing features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-scoreboard-update-coming-in-february" rel="nofollow">scoreboards</a>.</p>

<p>The problems at launch were so bad that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">a petition</a> to allow players to claim an unequivocal refund for the game reached <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-allow-refund-for-battlefield-2042-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost 234,000 signatures</a>, which is probably why EA wants to make sure the next game is ready for player scrutiny before it's released.</p>

<p>The seventh season of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which took place last year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">served as the game's last</a>, and production on the next game ramped up around the same time. Four studios - Motive, DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect - are currently working on the game.</p>

<p>We don't know what the next <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>will be called yet, nor do we know when it'll release, but we do, at least, know it'll have been made with the participation of the community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>The 1.0 update sounds substantial, from the number of new, improved and revamped features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/690830/view/507318638682833727">in this Steam news post</a>. It includes a coat of arms editor, new types of residential housing, a less restrictive progression system, and my favourite, "new and improved walls". This is referring to the kind of walls that wrap around and fortify your village, but I like to imagine they mean just all the walls.
</p>
<p>I really don't want to undersell the size of the update. One of the other subheadings is "a completely revamped art direction." No minor final tweaks are these.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the scale of these changes, some Early Access saves will no longer be compatible with the 1.0 release. If that means you, you can still access older version of the game within Steam by heading to the game properties, hitting up the beta tab, and selecting 'early_access_1_9' in the dropdown. Mods will also need updating, and as such are not currently available immediately after the 1.0 launch.
</p><p>Apparently the developers plan to continue to support the game with new quality-of-life updates, modding features and tools and more, as well as DLC in due course. Whether any of this will allow Alice B to live down her bread shame, I do not know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonic 3 recently surpassed Detective Pikachu to become the second-highest-grossing video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://screenrant.com/sonic-3-second-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-box-office-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>, a report by <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-3-(2024)#tab=summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Numbers</a> reveals that Sonic 3 earned $462.5 million globally, with domestic and international box office earnings almost at par. Sonic 3’s latest numbers beat Detective Pikachu’s $450 million, which held the title of second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time until today. However, Sonic 3 is miles away from The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s earnings, which managed to bring in $1.36 billion globally, retaining the title of the highest-earning video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic 3 sees Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails join forces to confront one of their most formidable opponents yet: Shadow. Shadow is a fan-favourite character from the video game series, and excitement for the movie skyrocketed when Keanu Reeves was announced to portray the enigmatic character. The enhanced visuals and Jim Carrey’s outstanding performance as Dr. Eggman have also contributed to the film’s success.</p>



<p>With Sonic 3 becoming the second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time, players will expect more movie adaptations to be released in the near future. Just recently, a popular video game got greenlit for a movie adaptation, and fans are waiting in anticipation for its arrival. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-movie-confirmed-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sleeping Dogs movie</a> is now confirmed to be in production, with Story Kitchen, Square Enix, and Simu Liu bringing it to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has been confirmed, with the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-confirmed-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poised to release in 2027.</a> Also, a post-credits scene may have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked the new characters</a> arriving for Sonic 4.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-review.1098801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's one historical movie scene that comes to mind for me when I think about Sid Meier's Civilization 7, and it's not a flashy arena fight in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/gladiator">Gladiator</a> or mission control cheering as we safely bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/apollo-13">Apollo 13</a> back home. It's Leo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-aviator">The Aviator</a>, running his hand along an airplane fuselage and insisting that he doesn't want to see any rivets. There's some method to the madness of smoothing out the texture in its design, and at times I can see why Firaxis went in this direction. But while its takes some good swings with combat and diplomacy and it is still overall a good time to build a civilization from the ground up, I find that this obsessive streamlining is more often than not to the long-awaited 4X successor's detriment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me just restate for emphasis right from the jump that I don't hate playing Civ 7. It retains a lot of the series' signature charm and polish. There's an almost indefinable quality of craftsmanship to it that none in the barrage of recent Civ competitors has been able to replicate. It's more that it’s like this iteration was designed by Apple, trying to be "user-friendly" by taking away the ability to dig into the guts of its systems or fine-tune your experience. And I’m an Android person.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Civilization 7 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest culprit here is the interface, which simply doesn't provide enough of the information I would hope to find in a strategy game of this complexity. Learning to play Civ 7 is downright frustrating, and while I eventually figured out how to live with its woefully inadequate tooltips and barren Civilopedia entries, I never liked it. I constantly found myself hovering over things and left-clicking, right-clicking, holding down Shift, Alt, Ctrl, screw it, ScrollLock – anything in the hope that I could bring up more information. But it’s just not there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one of my first campaigns, I saw a little guy called a Kahuna wandering around my territory. Now, I could open up the Civilopedia and type in “Kahuna” and find out that he's a unique missionary available to the Hawaiian civ. But bar that, I don't have any information available here on the map about what he is. Is he a military unit? Is he dangerous? What is he doing here? Can I eat him? Likewise, clicking on a city center will bring up a basic info view, and you can click a button to show more information. But not a lot more information. Rarely enough.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The interface simply doesn't provide enough of the information I would hope to find.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that every building is represented on the map, but hovering over them doesn’t remind me what they do. Again, I have to go into the Civilopedia and type out the name. There's not even a shortcut to click on a unit or building to bring up the Civilopedia entry that I could find. I can't even see where my specialists are placed unless I'm prompted to place a new specialist. That’s kind of bewildering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know Civ 7 is the first one to launch simultaneously on consoles, but information-dense games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/22/stellaris-console-edition-review">Stellaris</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves of Qud</a> have done absolutely admirably at making all of their vital details available at the touch of a controller. The absolute worst solution to the problem is just to go, "Eh, you don't really need detailed tooltips, do you?" That's exactly what Civ 7 has done, and while not catastrophic, it gets on my nerves constantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This minimalist philosophy even extends to the set-up screen, which has a paltry number of options compared to any previous Civ game in the past couple of decades. There are three world sizes and six different map types, but if you want to know what the difference between “Continents” and “Continents Plus” is, again, you're out of luck, buddy. Go Google it maybe. There's no explanation of the different difficulty levels, either. And while "Standard" does feel fairly large, even on "Archipelago" it generated maps where more than half of the world is land, so I was really missing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review">Civ 6</a> options like world age, rainfall, sea level, or any of the neat tweaks I've come to expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And even if there were more map types, I don’t know if it’d make a difference with the way things are balanced right now. A farm on flat desert is just as productive as one on flat grassland, so trying to switch things up by making a desert world would be a mostly visual change. It really feels like Firaxis wanted to give us a very specific, narrow experience with almost no room for customization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as I said, that narrow experience is not by any means a terrible one. There is something to be said for a lean, mean, streamlined Civilization game a la <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/02/civilization-revolution-review-2">Civ Revolution</a>. And once I settled into its awkward, one-size-fits-all throne, I was having a pretty good time for most of it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The music and sound design deserve a prominent mention.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The music and sound design deserve a prominent mention. Christopher Tin only puts out bangers, and "Live Gloriously," which features lyrics in Ancient Greek taken straight from The Iliad, is no exception. I also enjoyed Gwendoline Christie's narration, and the sound effects for everything from plopping a new district to opening fire with a rifle company are punchy and satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, in a first for this series, well-written narrative events pop up to bring a touch of human character to the broad sweep of history, and I particularly liked that there are some impactful ones for specific Civs. Playing as the Shawnee, upon unlocking factories, I got the option to keep true to our people's old ways, which reduced the production output of my industries but gave me a bonus to culture. For Persia, I got a miniature quest chain that rewarded me for sending one of my Immortals on his own little hero's journey. And the crises that happen at the Age transitions – which can be anything from barbarians at the gates to a super plague that wrecks tiles – are varied and exciting. I'm pretty sure I haven't even seen all of them yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The re-imagining of smaller eras as three larger, more distinct Ages with their own mechanics and victory conditions feels a bit too broad, though – particularly the middle one, Exploration. This period stretches from basically the end of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and it feels like it's trying to cover too much to have a coherent identity. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And, peculiarly, Civ 7 only really covers history up to about 1950. You get planes and tanks, but there are no home computers or helicopters in this tech tree at launch. The final science victory condition is launching the first manned spaceflight – quite a step back from setting up an exoplanet colony. Again, it feels like the conceptual space Civilization exists in has been sliced down to the bone for the sake of simplicity. And it leaves us with some awkward edge cases, like the Mughal Empire, which was politically irrelevant by the mid-1700s and completely dead by 1857, being a Modern Age pick. Even just having four ages instead of three, I think, would have made this much less awkward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, though, I like the idea of changing which historical culture your civ adopts with each age, an idea that Amplitude introduced in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/humankind-review-4x-strategy-game">Humankind</a> a few years ago and Firaxis has improved upon by putting semi-realistic restrictions on who you can pick next. I never liked the idea of American tribesmen founding Washington D.C. in the Stone Age, and civ switching shakes up the gameplay and allows you to pivot from military to culture to science without ruining your whole run. But it has its drawbacks, too. Given that Civ 7’s otherwise slick-looking animated leaders don't change at all visually through the Ages, you end up with some confusing situations like having Ben Franklin declare war on you and then having to look up what civ he's actually controlling right now. Persia? Ooookay.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As is tradition, warfare is the most fun way to play.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As is tradition, warfare is the most fun way to play, and I love the clever solution of army commanders letting several units ride on their backs to move around the map, then deploying to actually fight. That’s a good compromise between stacks of doom and one unit per tile, and having the commanders be the only ones to earn XP cuts down on micromanaging per-unit upgrades. The AI still can't present much of a challenge to an experienced player who knows how to exploit the terrain and focus fire on priority targets unless they outnumber you three- or four-to-one, but hey, it's Civ. What else is new? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, for one thing, when you end your turn all enemy units move at once, and your view will never be taken to the site of a battle when your units are being attacked. So if you’re fighting on multiple fronts, or you just happen to be looking somewhere else, the start of each turn becomes a crime scene investigation to figure out what happened. You’ll get notifications if a unit dies, but not if it’s reduced to its last few hitpoints. If the idea here was to make the end turn time faster, the cure is definitely worse than the disease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the plus column, the centering of Influence as a base game currency is probably my favorite change from Civ 6 to Civ 7. The highlight is that it can be spent to engage in a tug-of-war for War Support, which penalizes your opponent's happiness and combat ability when you swing it in your favor. It feels way less annoying to get declared on by surprise when the systems recognize that there are diplomatic and tactical consequences for such naked aggression, and I can press a button to make them worse by denouncing that jerk Isabella. It also effectively forces would-be conquerors to supplement their bloodlust with a good PR team that swings public opinion to your side even when you're clearly the aggressor, which makes the military path more interesting.</p><div id="rank-every-civilization-game" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank every Civilization Game</h3><h3>Rank every Civilization Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If conquest isn’t your ambition there is still another "instant" victory condition for winning the space race, but otherwise, the overall winner is determined by these “Legacy Paths” for Military, Economic, Scientific, and Cultural achievements, which have different objectives each Age and don't penalize you for changing up your strategy in each one. I found that they do, however, encourage generalization over specialization, since being declared the winner by total legacy score at the end often comes down to simply completing as many objectives in as many different categories as possible. Conquering a couple cities as a science player or making a few treasure fleets as a culture player is typically the tie-breaker in a close match. And I wasn't crazy about having to dabble in everything to avoid falling behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some paths are better designed than others – I’m looking at you, Culture. Flatly, it's bad. There's no tourism anymore, so it's mostly just about collecting artifacts by racing for a very limited number of dig sites with your explorers or vomiting out so many wonders that your starting cities end up looking ridiculous and the wonders themselves don't feel so singular or special. Then, the religion-flavored Exploration Age culture objectives suck even more. I hope you like missionary spam and endless whack-a-mole conversions that you can’t guard against. There's a little bit of strategy to it, like the fact that each settlement can now have a rural and an urban faith that need to be converted separately, but otherwise it’s just spending production to churn out as many Bible-thumpers as you can. I know we all like to make fun of Civ 6's "theological combat," but at least it was something, right? It was gameplay. This is a chore.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's not a great game right now, but it could be with time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, this whole one step forward, two steps back thing is par for the course when it comes to comparing a brand-new Civ to previous ones with years of patches and DLC to refine them. It's not lost on me that people said the same things about the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/20/civilization-v-review">Civ 5</a>, my all-time favorite of the series. So I have an optimistic outlook on Civ 7, despite all my kvetching – and believe me, there’s a lot more minor grievances I could list. I do think a lot of what bugs me about it could be fixed without redesigning the entire thing. They could add better tooltips and game set-up options in a patch. Civ 6 didn’t let you rename cities at launch either, but that was soon added. And naturally, history teaches us a lot of lacking systems can and probably will be fleshed out in expansions. It's not a great game right now, but I believe it could be with time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least it comes out of the gate looking slick. One of the only hills – er, mountains – I will die on is that I really don't like the way mountains look. They kind of remind me of a big pile of rocks, or like a kid's papier mache volcano project they made for science class. They don't have the appearance of a nice, realistic range of snow capped peaks like the ones I can see out my window here in Colorado. I'm also really not a fan of the new board-gamey look for undiscovered territory, even though the reveal effect is nice. Give me clouds or an old-timey map over this shiny nonsense any day.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 4X Games</h3><p>The best games to explore, expand, exploit, and extol in 2024.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the units and cities look incredible, if sometimes a bit cluttered. City-states got a big glow-up, both visually and mechanically. They all have unique 3D dioramas with culturally-specific clothing and props for dozens of miniature "civs" that didn't make the cut, which is kind of incredible considering how many there are, and each can grant you a unique tile improvement. The way you compete for them, though, has again been streamlined. It's just a race to fill up the suzerain bar first, and you can no longer "steal" them away from another leader once they’re committed. Not that it mattered that much in single-player, since it seemed like the AI was simply not interested in competing for them the vast majority of the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also some meta progression where you can unlock equippable items for specific leaders or cosmetics like new profile backgrounds for playing the same leader multiple times and completing specific challenges. It's… whatever. I'm not annoyed by its existence, but it could completely disappear and I probably wouldn't notice or care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But before we wrap up here, where the heck is Gandhi? How are you going to release a Civilization game without Gandhi? To be fair, the quirky leader choices are neat. I like that we're branching out from exclusively executive-level political figures. But come on. That's like Halo without Master Chief, or Mario without… well, Mario. The lack of recognizable faves just comes across to me as, "We're going to sell them to you individually later," even if the intention was simply to vary things up. If that’s the case, why are there two different Napoleons?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The idea that there would be not just one but two games about such a niche topic intrigued me, and it made me curious about all the other hyper-focused <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/playway-polish-simulator-game-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simulators</a> that might be out there, with which I could happily become obsessed so I can stop obsessing about, uh, other things.</p><p>My favorite “pretend to have a job you’d never have in real life” game is <a href="https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em></a>, which is a bit ironic considering that in real life I haven’t driven a car in a decade. I’ve never gotten far enough in <em>Euro Truck </em>to create a thriving shipping empire, tending to just like driving my fake truck around listening to real life radio stations. I actually learned about 2014’s protests in Ferguson, Missouri, while playing the game; the news broke on a UK radio station I was listening to shortly after buying the game, which was a really weird way to learn some major world news.</p><p>I’m also, of course, a fan of <a href="https://powerwash-simulator.square-enix-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a>, which I imagine gets its appeal less from imagining working as a power washer and more because it scratches the same itch as a coloring book. Years ago I got into an early access game called <a href="https://kotaku.com/sailaway-lets-you-explore-the-worlds-oceans-in-real-tim-1794807951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sailaway</em></a>, which used real-life weather and mapping data to simulate sailing a boat around the world. The actual sailing mechanics overwhelmed me, especially in its early state, so I mostly used it to say “I wonder what the weather is like near Antarctica right now” and go find out.&nbsp;</p><p>I go through periodic bouts of wondering if the perfect <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horseracing</a> simulator exists, because I unpredictably become obsessed with researching how board and video games have recreated the sport in a way that captures the randomness of race betting without being <em>too</em> random. One of the games I most see mentioned in that space is called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1166860/Rival_Stars_Horse_Racing_Desktop_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rival Stars Horse Racing</em></a>, but it always comes with enough caveats (and a high enough price tag) that I’ve never quite bitten the bullet.&nbsp;</p><p>I spent the entire weekend refreshing social feeds and news sites long past the point of necessity, so I’m staggering into this week with my entire nervous system wrung out like a towel. It’s not a good way to live, and there are many more productive and useful ways for me to manage my feelings that I’m determined to tap into instead. But help knock me out of my funk by telling me about the games you love that make your friends go “they made <em>what</em> into a game?” The weirder the better.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea"><h3>BioWare Is In Big Trouble</h3></a><p>"A lot was riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a massive game that is packed with detail. Whether it’s the huge amount of different types of armour you can wear, the reams of codex entries giving in depth background information, or how easy it is to die to a pack of wolves, it’s filled with so much stuff. Blacksmithing, swordfighting, hunting, duels, thieving, there’s a lot to keep track of. It’s in many ways a Medieval immersive sim more than what is commonly called an RPG, and can be thoroughly engrossing because of this, but the ambitions to create such a broad world can fray at the edges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Review –&nbsp;Another medieval epic RPG" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYdOp8TGCpQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story picks up from the cliffhanger ending of the first game, as Henry goes with Sir Hans as part of his retinue to deliver a message of peace to Lord von Bergow of Trosky Castle. Unsurprisingly, things don’t go according to plan and bandits attack whilst you’re having a bath in a lake, resulting in the loss of your horse, armour, weapons, allies, the letter for Bergow, and eventually splitting you up from Sir Hans, who storms off after an argument. Now with nothing but filthy beggars clothes to your name, you still need an audience with von Bergow, but you simply can’t get one because you look like a commoner. Ew, stinky!</p>


<p>From this opening, you’re drawn in several different directions. Wanting to meet von Bergow means trying to get into a wedding he’ll be attending, but that means you need to get in the good graces of the locals. The best way to do that is by picking up a trade like blacksmithing – Henry’s the son of a blacksmith, after all – and odd jobs to help people. Alternatively you can just hare off and try to find Henry’s dog, Mutt. This ends up being more of a wild goose chase than a dog hunt, taking you to unexplored parts of the map, filled with dangers.</p>


<p>Mutt himself is… strange. As you interact with him, your Houndsmanship skill will improve, allowing you to unlock perks that let him to do things like bark to attract attention or hunt down game, except when I’ve used this he mostly followed our prey around without managing to bite it. NPCs also vary between liking him so much that you can hear “silly doggy!” every few minutes, to being very annoyed about his mere existence. I once snuck into a room in a castle to use an alchemy station and could hear a guard outside the entire time telling my dog off. When I got outside, there were actually six different guards crowded about Mutt telling him to move. Silly doggy, indeed.</p>
<p>This isn’t even the strangest thing you can level up in this game. Every stat that you have is levelled up through performing relevant actions, a video game equivalent to practice making perfect, and through this you’ll boost your swordsmanship, smithing, thievery, and so on. This goes so far as to letting you get better at drinking alcohol. Over time you’ll become resistant to the negatives of being drunk, such as hangovers or (ironically) addiction, whilst the positives such as a boost to charisma last longer, not to mention being able to drink more before getting properly drunk.</p>
<p>In general, it’s good to do a little bit of everything.&nbsp;I focused on the things I’d expect an honourable wannabe knight to be doing, which excluded things like thievery, but I quickly felt that the game was pushing me into situations where I needed to do things outside of my comfort zone. If you haven’t been levelling thievery when you reach a mission that requires stealth, you can struggle a lot.</p>
<p>I, myself, had a disastrous three hour stretch after being tortured where I was trying to sneak away whilst what seemed like an army of guards were patrolling the hilly woods through which I was sneaking. I died over, and over, and over, much to my frustration, particularly since being tortured had halved all my stats. This also happened at the end of a very lengthy questline that, whilst cool, was exceptionally long.</p>

<p>That’s a running theme in this game; everything takes a long time. It’s exceptionally long-winded and, much like the intensely detailed mechanics elsewhere, whether or not this is for you is going to depend on either your patience or your enthusiasm for medieval politics. Conversations with everyone from smelters to lords can be absolutely packed with information, whether interpersonal details about other characters, background information about smelting, mining or countless other topics. Much of it is optional, but you never know what will be necessary to learn and you can sometimes feel a little worn out after a lengthy chat you’ve just had. To be honest, I really enjoy the incredible amount of detail, but it won’t be for those with a shorter attention span.</p>
<p>With a game of this scope, it’s no surprise that there’s some nagging issues, such as sometimes not actually explaining things clearly enough. Even now, dozens of hours into the game there are details I am still working out, such as why, when blacksmithing, I get the exact sparks and ringing sound that signals a good hit, but Henry comments about nearly breaking the piece I’m smithing. Add to that some clumsiness with aiming hammer blows and it makes it feel like it’s not working properly, or that I’ve missed a particular nuance. Still, heating up metal and working it into a sword here is far more immersive and bespoke than a hasty QTE or rhythm action mini-game you might expect.</p>

<p>That’s part of why I just can’t get enough of the game. It’s unique and challenging, with a specific vision that it doesn’t compromise at all. Going on a trip with a lord early on was a highlight, it was like it was taken out of a medieval drama and incredibly immersive. I even enjoyed a wedding as I was kept entertained by various hijinks, such as regularly hunting down someone to stop them getting drunk, or getting destroyed three times in a row in a duel.</p>
<p>Starting off in the verdant countryside surrounding Trosky Castle, going between villages and hunting through the woods on missions, the large city of Kuttenberg is a big change of pace. The streets are packed with stalls and traders, there’s crowds that will gather to see someone’s crimes read out as they stand in the stocks, and generally the feel of a hustling, bustling city. The streets can get busy, but there’s maybe not enough people consistently to really sell the population count you’d expect, though it’s convincing enough when compared with villages around Trosky.</p>

<p>Some of the illusion is broken by bugs and other minor moments of weirdness, many of which we expect to be to addressed with a day 1 patch, but they thankfully rarely affect the game experience too much. There’s some visual glitches with rain and some flickering lights, for example, and NPCs can get a little lost, walk in circles or get caught between bits of the environment. They also like to bunch up in corridors and stairs, blocking the way through, which isn’t helped by the typically cramped medieval buildings. Reactions to you and the permissiveness of the world are also inconsistent feeling. You can’t really tell if you’re allowed in somewhere without just barging in and seeing how people react, but even if it’s someone you’re acquainted and generally cordial with, they might snap at you rudely.</p>
<p>The inventory and the UI in general looks quite nice, with a skeumorphic medieval style, but the maps, inventory, quest log screens slide a lot of details and important information off the side of the screens in a way never feels natural. It’s a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>On the other hand, and very much in keeping with the tactile crafting and jobs you do, I don’t mind the lockpicking minigame, where you wiggle your right analog until you find the sweet spot, then try to keep it in the same relative position as the lock rotates. It’s takes a bit to get used to it, but works quite well and at least it’s not the same lockpicking minigame or Pipemania from every other game in the world.</p>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation, Xbox</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a game I massively anticipated when it was first announced. I eventually got <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my first hands-on with it</a> and then finally played it. Playing it did reveal the more modest nature of the development, but it also made it clear that Warhorse Studios cared about what they put out. With what was nothing short of a monumental success, the sequel—Kingdom Come: Deliverance II—was inevitable.</p>
<p>Now, I can't deny that I also held a lot of hype for this game. This was strengthened when <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I could play the game in Kuttenberg</a>, which is part of its setting. I certainly went into it thinking Warhorse could learn from and build upon the strengths of the first and work on the weaknesses that resulted in some issues for people. The question is, have they managed to do this?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-02-Party-in-the-Bathhouse-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>A line I often hear is, "Bigger is not always better". In my case, it's frequently followed by "but in this case, bigger would have been better", as yet another person looks disappointed at the two minutes we've just spent together. Judging by the comments from the girls in the bathhouses, this isn't an issue Henry suffers from, though he may have a few unusual requests based on the dialogue. In the case of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, bigger is most certainly better, but that's because the bigger is justified, explained, and done right.</p>
<p>Going on a slight tangent, but it will come back around, is something I want to say about world design. Ideally, the open or linear world must be believable when playing a game. I don't mean believable in the sense that it can't have magic, dragons, or that middle-aged blokes from Yorkshire are suddenly the main attraction for all women; we all know only one of those is the case, and David Copperfield has given us that answer.</p>
<p>No, what needs to happen is that the events and locations need to be believable in the world presented in front of you, and the corresponding information, dialogue, and characters all need to reflect that reality. Most open-world games will tell you how massive they are, but few feel real - even those based on actual areas. In Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the villages felt like villages and had the things needed in places like that. Rattay felt big, but that was the scale for Henry, and Sassau felt huge, with the monastery astounding for a person like Henry.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a whole new level, and I believe every second of it. When you realise that the events of the second game take place 100km and 30km away from the events of the first game, based on the locations of the first and second maps of this outing, respectively, the scale makes a supposed galaxy-spanning trip like those in Starfield feel like walking to the corner shop. The characters' behaviour, their reaction to new areas, and how these areas react to them all make it feel like uncharted territory. It makes it believable.</p>

</figure>


<p>Let's start with size. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II takes place across two maps. According to Warhorse, combined, this makes the sequel a little under double that of the original, and based on my time across both maps, I would have said at least double. However, and with game maps, this is true; size doesn't count. What counts here is the <del>girth</del> density. This feels packed, like the meatiest sausage you steal from the warehouse of Sigismund and give to beggars. Get your mind out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Indeed, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldurs-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sheer quantity of quests, side quests, activities</a>, and even just random easter-eggs you come across, this feels like Warhorse wanted to strike a nearly impossible balance of making what are genuinely small areas - we're talking kilometres across - feel huge. Part of this links to what I said before because these things will feel huge to Henry, and the scale represents this. The first time you see Kuttenberg, it looks enormous. Once you're inside, it feels it, too.</p>
<p>Let's talk length. If you like to explore, and you want to do the side quests, you want to go off the beaten track in the hopes of finding some easter eggs; essentially, if you play like me, be ready for a hundred-plus-hour experience, one where I don't think for a second you'll be bored. There is also replay value, as many of the game and quests will have changes based on your actions. Sometimes, these are slight changes; other times, they are big.</p>
<p>What is important to note is that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is on a grander scale than the first. Being a direct sequel, you are no longer Henry, the random scrub from Skalitz; you are Henry, the squire of Sir Hans Capon. You are the bastard of nobility, and you have your experiences and demons from the first game. The start of the game makes Henry a near-blank slate again to get the progression back in.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-04-Kuttenberg-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I've covered how this happens in my preview - <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here's a link to it again</a> - so long story short, you are ambushed, and Henry gets seriously injured and weakened as a result. You don't forget how to read; everything else must be built back up. Even your now almost-fresh relationship with Mutt, Henry's doggo companion, is explained adequately. It is not quite sequel amnesia, but it is close to it and, again, explained.</p>
<p>Like in the first game, levelling skills are achieved through your actions. You fight with a sword; you'll improve your swordsmanship. Read books and ask questions in conversations; your scholarship will be boosted. You also have people who can teach you, strengthen your skills - and give you new combat techniques - through the game, some only available depending on the outcome of certain quests. Granted, you can cheat this system by getting all quest outcomes in some (side quest) situations.</p>
<p>The second area provides an example. A pregnant lady asks you to find a Thunderstone, believed to bring good luck. Only the people who had it had it stolen. Long story short, you can eventually get a hold of it, give it back to the people from whom it was stolen, and get a reward. Then you can pickpocket the person or obtain it some other way, and steal it, go to the pregnant lady and get a reward from her. Then you can steal it from her and keep it for yourself. I'm not aware if it brings good luck, though.</p>
<p>I digress, skills. So yes, your skill levels will develop over time, and you can target your development; I particularly pushed scholarship as I wanted the perk from it, which unlocked all the key icons on the maps, giving me a good idea of things I may be missing, and more for me to explore. One such thing was a Disney easter egg, where there was indeed a poisoned apple, which gave me permanent tiredness. Fortunately, I saved before eating it.</p>
<p>Digressing again. Most of all, the progression feels natural, and the quests are reactive; if your alchemy skill is high enough, you can lecture people who could accidentally harm others. With a high enough Scholarship, you're going to be able to surprise a few nobles here and there. With Survival and others, you'll become a good battlefield medic.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-05-Sleeping-Snow-White-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, all that is gameplay, but how about the other aspects of gameplay within Kingdom Come: Deliverance II? One of the more complicated parts of the first game was the combat. It was certainly unique in its style, with the only games with a more detailed melee combat system being titles like Chivalry. Warhorse Studio knows this was a bit of a barrier for people, and they have eased off a little.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean it's simplified in a "casual" way because it isn't. They have reduced the number of points on the target system to four: up, down, left and right, and this has undoubtedly made combat "easier" in the sense that you can get to grips with it better. The way enemies are attacking is more transparent, which makes parrying and countering easier, but at the same time, the enemies will be more than happy to do the same to you.</p>
<p>No, combat is just as engaging, if not more engaging, than in the original. I've found myself on the edge of my seat with some duels, with parries and counters coming close to double digits, a keen eye on my stamina, and wishing to hell that the enemy would tire out a little or try to get in a counter and then a combination to give myself that edge. Combat feels incredibly fluid for the most part. My only real complaint is the locking system, which can be a hindrance when you are dealing with multiple enemies, as it doesn't always do what you want.</p>
<p>What I find impressive about Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is that it adds scale to the combat. The first had its set-piece battles, but they feel bigger here because they are. For spoilers, I'm not going to go into much detail, but there are battles and sieges, and of course, you're not facing every single enemy; there are more on the battlefield. The battlefield also features new ways of combat, which has a key impact on the game and its story.</p>
<p>One of these is gunpowder. It had only started being used in Europe around 80 years before the game's setting, and it was still limited in its use. The first was never on a big enough scale to feature a cannon, and as you're in bigger territory now, you'll also find the use of guns. I don't like them - they take an absolute age to reload - but they do damage and can significantly impact enemy morale.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-06-Reforging-the-Sword-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The other systems featured in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II add to this. Energy and hunger are present but aren't pushed too far to impact the game's enjoyability. The two crafting systems, Alchemy and Blacksmithing, have two reasonably interesting minigames. The reputation system, with the added impact of much more intelligent AI, which can remember your actions and make simple deductions based on your presence in an area, massively impacts the game and adds to the world extensively.</p>
<p>A great example can be a random person reporting you for theft to the guards. Not because they saw you stealing but because they saw you snooping around an area when something was stolen. They made the logical deduction, and the guards will search you. You're free to go if you don't have the stolen goods but rest assured, people will remember you. You're even more memorable to people if you're a terrible drunk who gets into lots of fist-fights.</p>
<p>You'll notice I've avoided speaking about the story, and that's also because of spoilers. This directly continues from the first game, and much of what happened in the first game is directly referenced and linked to the story here. Some characters will return, and some things will be wrapped up, even if only slightly. While a little spoiler, and I won't say how, Henry gets back the sword crafted by his murdered father, stolen in the first game.</p>
<p>As a history fan, I find it interesting that characters like Jan Žižka play a significant part in the game. The game even teases Henry as the person who cost Jan one of his eyes. To give context, Jan Žižka lost one eye in battle before becoming blind and still leading troops afterwards. However, history is somewhat altered for the story's sake, as certain characters die before the game's setting. Anybody who has read up on some of these characters will know some spoilers, though.</p>
<p>I'm just looping this back to the systems; this focus on history in game form makes me love Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. It's not a power fantasy as with other RPGs; even when you have almost maxed out every skill and have outstanding equipment, you are one silly move or one three-vs-one battle from death. Early in the game, you're not even a foolish move from it. This is still the same challenge as the original, but in a more approachable form, where janky combat and other aspects aren't making things harder through lack of polish.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-07-The-First-Battle-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this. In the case of Oblivion, the fact that Bethesda hasn't moved the dial even a millimetre since then is telling: the same janky AI, the same bugs, the same genuinely average worlds.</p>
<p>Where the world reacts to everything, from the clothes you wear to how dirty they are and even if you happen to have walked through some excrement, to your behaviour and the way people remember your actions and can even make some logical assumptions in the case of thievery, this is the closest I've ever felt to being part of a living, breathing world, where the inhabitants feel like part of that world.</p>
<p>This isn't to say it is flawless. I've encountered a few bugs, though they have been scarce. There are a few floating objects here and there, including a magical bird nest hovering a metre above a rooftop. I've had the rare line of dialogue swapped and others where a line is repeating itself, over itself. I've also had a few enemy NPCs stuck on fences, which made my victory much more straightforward. A few random graphical glitches have popped in, too. Still, the flaws have been so few and far between I can't fault the polish.</p>
<p>I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the gaming industry's major trade body in the US, has urged the Trump administration to "consult with the private sector" regarding incoming tariffs on foreign-imported goods.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1886390949091123378" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared with Kotaku's Ethan Gach, the ESA says that tariffs on gaming hardware and products would "impact Americans of all ages" and that they could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans", as well as to the gaming industry itself.</p>

<p>The ESA goes on to urge Trump and his administration to "consult with the private sector in a transparent process" to avoid causing such harm to both Americans and "one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors in the US".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/esa-trump-tariffs-comments-e3.jpg?itok=bxfJLpBX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/esa-trump-tariffs-comments-e3.jpg?itok=ICjfNyW7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA is perhaps best-known by many for being the driving force behind E3 prior to its demise.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware, the tariffs to which the ESA is referring <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">were imposed</a> by President Trump this weekend, primarily targeting goods made in Mexico (although those particular tariffs have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-sheinbaum-trudeau-017efa8c3343b8d2a9444f7e65356ae9?taid=67a0e79c4fe82f000101eeaa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">paused for a month</a>), China, and Canada.</p>

<p>Specifically, Trump will impose a 25% tariff on Mexican- and Canadian-made goods, with a 10% tariff being slapped on Chinese-made products. This is, of course, a problem for companies that import their goods from those countries.</p>

<p>Many gaming consoles and peripherals are made in China, and as the BBC points out in the above-linked story, economists say that import hikes for companies are usually passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices.</p>

<p>This means that for a console as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly expensive as the PS5 Pro</a>, for instance, you could expect to pay significantly more in future, which could in turn lead to fewer consoles and accessories being purchased on the whole.</p>

<p>Of course, that would also probably mean a price hike for digital games in order to ensure parity between the two media types.</p>

<p>It's impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen at this stage, but the ESA is spooked enough to call on Trump and his administration to discuss the matter further with the gaming sector. Whether they do or not is another matter entirely. Stay tuned for more.</p>
