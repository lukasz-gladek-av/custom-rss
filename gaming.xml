            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/663084/lenovo-legion-9i-18-rtx-5090-2d-3d-gaming-laptop-announcement-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lenovo is announcing a new 10th-generation Legion 9i gaming laptop coming soon to China and scheduled for the fall in North America. The 18-inch behemoth is packed with top-end specs, including the option for a 4K-capable 2D / 3D screen, Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, up to 192GB of RAM, and 8TB of SSD storage.</p><p>How much will an over-the-top configuration like that cost? Nobody can say, as Lenovo isn’t talking pricing at all yet — not even the starting price for the base model with a 4K, non-3D screen. But when the time comes you won’t have to rely solely on Lenovo to build the configuration to your liking, as the four RAM slots and four SSD slots are user-accessible.</p><p>The optional 2D / 3D LCD can display 3840 x 2400 resolution at up to 240Hz in 2D mode or 1920 x 1200 in 3D mode. The screen also has a dual mode akin to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619052/razer-blade-18-nvidia-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-preorder-asus-msi">Razer Blade 18</a>, allowing up to an ultra-fast 440Hz when displaying 2D content in 1920 x 1080. Viewing 3D content on the Legion 9i’s screen doesn’t require glasses, as it uses eye-tracking and a lenticular lens array to appear 3D to the naked eye. Lenovo says the Legion 9i is designed for game developers, visual artists, and 3D professionals as well as spendy gamers. In addition to displaying 3D content and renders, Lenovo says its software supports 30 games playable in 3D. We have reached out to Lenovo for a list of compatible games, but did not receive an answer by time of publication.</p><p>As you’d expect from a desktop replacement-class laptop, the Legion 9i has a bunch of ports, including two Thunderbolt 5 ports, four USB 3.2 Gen 2 (three Type-A and one Type-C), an ethernet port, HDMI 2.1, and even a full-size SD card slot. For connectivity, it’s got Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support. If you go for the 2D screen the 5-megapixel webcam has an f/2 aperture, though the 3D screen option comes with a faster f/1.6 lens — and both webcams feature a kill switch on the side of the laptop for privacy.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption><em>If only the whole laptop could be decked out in this carbon fiber</em>.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Lenovo</cite></span></p></section><p>The laptop itself has a pretty unique look thanks to its carbon fiber lid. Lenovo says each Legion 9i’s lid is made from eight layers of carbon fiber, making it “lighter and stronger than aluminum.” But any weight savings aside, the coolest aspect of this carbon fiber creation is the visible pattern on the lid — which Lenovo says is slightly different and one-of-a-kind on each unit.</p><p>We may not know how much the Legion 9i costs just yet, but that lid instantly makes it one of the most interesting jumbo-sized gaming laptops in my book. At least, as far as ones not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">adorned with dragons</a> go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Today, 8th May, is a day of compound darkness, for it sees the release of (at least) two games with "midnight" in the title: Midnight Special from Scared Stupid Inc, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from Moonhood. A coincidence? Absolutely not. This is clearly an occult configuration of daunting power. It's also an opportunity to briefly compare two video game aesthetics, each comparably dense, tasty and insidious.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Midnight Walk is from them wot did animal fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fe">Fe</a>, which I appreciated but did not much enjoy, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>. It casts you as a cindery explorer, The Burnt One, who must help a chibi lantern bro called Potboy through a beautifully unpleasant world of gouged and shrunken clay surfaces and twitchy, stop-motion-style creatures. "Survive and outsmart the many monsters eager to devour your little friend's flame as you experience five tales of fire and darkness, featuring an incredible cast of odd characters," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">the Steam page</a> comments.
</p>

<p>
It's a first-person "dark adventure" with an emphasis on puzzling and using your noodle, but it does feature guns - hunky plasticene blunderbusses that wouldn't seem out of place in Doom, except that you appear to be very small in The Midnight Walk, small enough to sit on Doomguy's knuckle, wield a matchstick like a torch, or shelter beneath the pages of a dropped book. The world is perhaps more of a hive: you'll meet dreadful insects with hinged facemasks. I find it all quite appealing, though the stop-motion craftsmanship here feels quite sheeny and varnished next to the purposefully ramshackle splendour of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a>.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Special is another keg of giblets entirely. It's a horror point-and-clicker that takes inspiration from 16-bit adventure games together with various cinematic movements and genres: "the gory thrills of giallo, the suspense of slashers, and the otherworldly charm of 70s and 80s sci-fi". The year is 1978, the place is somewhere in Maine, and you are a babysitter exploring a labyrinthine manor. It's a game of four episodes: today's early access release nets you the Pilot episode encompassing "the first half of the house", though there's currently a free Prologue demo as well.

<p>
It seems less of an enclosed dark fantasy, and more openly steeped in the material culture of various periods than The Midnight Walk. There are nods to Steamboat Willy and older Macintosh desktop displays, for example. It's also bloodier and I think, more horrible in how it couples smearier bits of pixellation with the torments of the flesh. Still, at least there are no flap-faced Burtonesque spiders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/">You can read more on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please choose one of these games for further consideration and possibly, a purchase. I advise you not to play both, for there can only be <em>one</em> midnight. What dire cosmic consequences will you unleash, if you conjure the sunset twice over and investigate these elaborate, storied and allusive visual artefacts side by side? Don't come crying to me in the comments if tomorrow never dawns.

            <p>Valve has released a new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, adding weekly missions along with a number of other changes.</p>
<p>The weekly missions can be found via the main or play menu, with the developer adding each weekly mission will expire after seven days (makes sense). Players will be rewarded with XP for completing these missions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Counter-Strike 2 team has done a fair bit of rework with the game's maps. It has removed the following community maps from all game modes as part of this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basalt</li>
<li>Edin</li>
<li>Palais</li>
<li>Whistle</li>
</ul>
<p>It has also added three community maps to its Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch modes. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jura</li>
<li>Grail</li>
<li>Agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, two maps have been added to Wingman mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogtown</li>
<li>Brewery</li>
</ul>
<p>Sticking with maps, the team has also rejigged the game's Casual and Deathmatch map groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defusal Group Alpha: Dust 2, Mirage, Inferno, Vertigo.</li>
<li>Defusal Group Delta: Train, Anubis, Ancient, Overpass, Nuke.</li>
<li>Community Map Group: Jura, Grail, Agency.</li>
<li>Hostage Group: Office, Italy.</li>

<p>Last year, Will Judd asked the question: If Counter-Strike is so good, why did it take 24 years to make Counter-Strike 2?</p>
<p>"Counter-Strike 2 <em>is </em>Counter-Strike. The formula hasn't really changed since the 1999 original - terrorists and counter-terrorists sparring to eliminate the other side or plant/defuse a bomb at one of two designated locations - but Valve's 2023 release runs better on modern hardware than 2012's Global Offensive and offers sparingly more gameplay possibilities too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-review-despite-everything-its-still-you">Eurogamer's Counter-Strike 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally though, the core combination of tactical, round-based 5v5 competition and satisfyingly difficult shooting mechanics remain as enrapturing and enraging as ever."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has announced that there will be a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach limited edition DualSense controller, with pre-orders for it going live on May 22nd. The price for the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach limited edition DualSense has been set at $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480, with it being available directly from PlayStation. You can see pictures of the Dualsense below, including one of Hideo Kojima posing with one.</p>

		
		

<p>Sony has said that the pre-orders will be live from 10am ET in the U.S., and 10am local time in the U.K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Once the page goes live you will be able to order it from <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/">PlayStation Direct</a>, as well as participating retailers. The controller will be released on June 26th, which is also the release date for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Ordering through PlayStation directly will also net you free delivery.</p>


<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">Death Stranding PC review</a>, which came in 2020. For this release, Miguel said: “It’s a story well worth revisiting or experiencing for the first time on PC. The pacing of the game can certainly drag to a screeching halt through the middle, but with boosted frame rate and crisper visuals, you’ll likely be too mesmerised by the hauntingly gorgeous world of Hideo Kojima’s latest masterpiece to even care about the uneven story beats.”</p>

			<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an update on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, or rather, not on the lawsuit itself, which is still ongoing, but on its impacts on the game. The developer has had to introduce some changes due to the lawsuit, as detailed below:</p>
<p><em>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</em></p>
<p><em>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</em><br>
<em>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo is invoking patent infringement, but Pocketpair alleges that at least some of those patents were filed after the release of their game. We'll keep you updated with any major updates to the lawsuit involving one of the biggest games of 2024.</p>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has forecast global sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles by the end of March 2026, which would be roughly comparable to the original Switch’s first year on sale, despite retailing for a much higher price. The company suffered an expected slump in both hardware and software sales this year, according to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf">latest earnings release</a>, and will be hoping for a bumper year ahead.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5th, so will have 10 months on sale to hit that forecast, with Nintendo also expecting to sell 45 million Switch 2 games in the same period. It’s not written its older console off though, and is expecting to shift another 4.5 million Switch consoles and over 100 million games in the year ahead, down from 10.8 million and 155 million of each last year.</p><p>The first Switch launched in March 2017, at the tail end of a fiscal year, so direct sales comparisons are tricky. It <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 17.79 million units worldwide</a> in its first 13 months on sale — comfortably more than Nintendo’s forecasts at the time — so Nintendo is expecting sales in the same ballpark this time around. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to overtaking the DS</a> as Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>Nintendo might be hedging its Switch 2 sales estimate, however, given the uncertainties with tariffs in the all-important US market. We’ve already seen that Switch 2 demand is higher than the company may have expected, despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">widespread complaints about the $449.99 price tag</a>. When US preorders finally began — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delayed in the wake of Trump’s tariffs</a>, amid fears that the price would climb even higher — they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">sold out almost immediately</a>. Meanwhile the company put out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">supply warning in Japan</a> after receiving 2.2 million applications for preorders, which Nintendo said “far exceeds our expectations.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Necromancy has been banned by the Mages Guild yet nobody cares if you use undead summons. This mod fixes that," reads a description for the mod on Nexus Mods. "In addition, while not illegal in the lore, optionally you can choose to have summoning undead result in a 100-gold bounty if done near a guard. This makes Necromancy feel like something you really need to hide."</p>
<p>The mod adds one other touch to make necromancy feel more like an underground act of scumbaggery. Spells that let you summon the undead can no longer be bought from Mages Guild vendors, but you'll still find them sold by other, less reputable, magic users (hello <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Shady_Sam">Shady Sam</a>, one tome of Headless Zombie, please). Or you can find them on necromancer corpses. Which I'm sure you won't reanimate - it's illegal. </p>
<p>Considering a lot of righteous quests involve hunting down necromancers and zombie-raising ill-doers, there is definitely a sense that this practice is seen as disgusting, immoral, and wrong in the Elder Scrolls world. That so few characters care if you do it near them is arguably just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">one of Oblivion's silly charms</a>, like becoming so good at crouching it renders you immediately invisible in broad daylight. But it's nice to have a mod that makes characters react in the way you might expect. </p>
<p>You will need to use another mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> to make certain changes to character dialogue work with this one, though, says the creator of the necromod "MadAborModding". </p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil," a random NPC will often tell you in Oblivion, "but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the Mages Guild has banned it." At least now, with this mod, that statement will feel a little more accurate. Modding for the Oblivion Remastered has not received any official support, but it's booming nonetheless, with nearly 2000 mods uploaded to Nexus Mods so far. Even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/some-old-mods-from-2008-still-work-in-oblivion-remastered">old mods for the original 2008 game still work</a>.

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is less than two months from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned release date</a>. As part of a media blast, creator Hideo Kojima was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/death-stranding-2-an-interview-with-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by the PlayStation Blog</a>, revealing more details about the sequel. For instance, the upcoming game will provide players with more choice and freedom in comparison to the previous installment.</p>
<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was designed with a similar philosophy. Players familiarized themselves with the ‘delivery game’ genre with the first game, and the sequel builds on that and provides players with more choice and freedom, particularly around combat; you can go in guns blazing, or you can choose not to use weapons at all. We also made cars and motorcycles more accessible.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the story, the predecessor was centred around Sam and Cliff. This time, the story delves deeper into who Lou is, her relationship with Sam, as well as Sam’s backstory.</em></p>
<p>Kojima then talked about the choice of setting (Mexico and Australia):</p>
<p><em>Mexico shares a border with the UCA (United Cities of America), so the neighboring cities had to be connected. As Sam mentions many times in the game, we were extremely mindful that building these ‘connections’ didn’t appear invasive. Sam’s journey of connecting the Americas from east to west was inspired by the American frontier. With the UCA established, we wanted the sequel to take place in a location that shared a similar geography with the Americas — stretches from east to west and borders the sea in the north and south. Eurasia is too large, and Africa didn’t really fit the bill either. Australia checked all the boxes, but the next issue we faced was how to connect the North American continent with Australia. After a lot of discussion, we decided to implement the ‘plate gate’ to connect the two continents.</em></p>

<p>Today, Sony also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/revealing-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-limited-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Limited Edition DualSense controller. The design was conceived in collaboration with the game developer, Kojima Productions.</p>
<p>The controller will be available on June 26, the same day as the game. Its price is $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480. Pre-orders will begin on May 22 at 10 AM local time via the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Direct website</a> in the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>

Nintendo expects to sell another 4.5m units of its aging original Switch this year, despite the impending launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
While the older console's momentum continues to slow, this forecast would see Switch - now at 152.12m sold - reach 156.62m, overtaking Nintendo DS as the company's best-selling hardware of all time.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo DS tapped out at 154.02m units sold across its long life, more than the Wii (101m) and even the combined totals of Game Boy and Game Boy Color (118m). But there's still one further hurdle to pass.

<p>
Sony has historically never released an exact figure for lifetime PS2 sales, though has quoted an estimate of 160m sold. Can Nintendo get to that figure with Switch 1? After this financial year, ending 31st March 2026, it's predicting it will be just 3.38m away. 
</p>
<p>
In the grand scheme of things, this does not seem too big a gap to close. But it remains to be seen how the launch of Switch 2 will further impact sales of Switch 1, and whether Nintendo can keep its older console selling. 
</p>

<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232">social media platform X earlier today</a>, Pocketpair expressed its disappointment that such actions were required back then, before stating it was now having to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This 'compromise' arrives with Patch v0.5.5. "From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals," the Palworld team wrote. "Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide."</p>
<p>The developer said it understood this would be "disappointing for many", just as it is for the Palworld team. However, it said the changes are "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to the game's development, and it remains "committed... to delivering exciting new content" for players.</p>
<p>Pocketpair said it disputes the claims made against it, and still "[asserts] the invalidity of the patents in question".</p>

<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Pocketpair responded to Nintendo's legal action by asserting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-lawyers-state-existence-of-titanfall-2-ark-and-even-the-legend-of-zelda-invalidates-nintendos-patents">the patents The Pokémon Company believes Pocketpair has contravened are invalid due to other games that came before it</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, Tomb Raider, and even Nintendo's own Legend of Zelda series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>2020 seems like a lifetime ago, and for the developers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/revenge-of-the-savage-planet">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, it probably feels like it’s been even longer. Putting all the real world tumult of the past half decade to one side, Raccoon Logic was known as Typhoon Studios at the time and just on the cusp of releasing their debut title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, when Google came along and bought them up, setting them to work on Google’s Stadia streaming platform. While Journey to the Savage Planet still arrived on other consoles, the Stadia port came not long before Google decided they didn’t want to make games anymore, shutting the studio down, and leaving both them, and the Savage Planet IP, lost in space.</p>
<p>For once, this isn’t a tale where the corporate giants won out. The team re-emerged as Raccoon Logic, reacquired their IP, and set about making a sequel that’s even more Savage than the first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Launch Trailer | Revenge of the Savage Planet | PAX East" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wMoHoFgh9E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was a scouring piece of satire, poking fun at corporate greed and consumerism with genuine humour and wit. It’s fair to say that this is even stronger in the sequel, with the real-world dramas with Google clearly playing into the storytelling, with some of the funniest satirical videos, corporate emails and missives found in gaming.</p>
<p>This theme is no less obvious than during the game’s opening moments, with your plucky space explorer arriving to colonise a new planet under the flag of Alta, an intergalactic mega-corp, only to find that they’re immediately sacked, and that no one else is coming. It’s a poignant and punishing moment for you, your character, and the team, but the clear message from Raccoon Games is that you should just get on with it.</p>

<p>Getting on with it involves shooting a lot of alien creatures, and turning them into a variety of different coloured goo. The menagerie is colourful and creative, and as the name implies, utterly savage. One glimpse and they’ll try to turn you into barbecue, unless you do the same to them first!</p>

<p>Despite the fact that no one is coming to populate the prefabbed units of Nu Florida, you set about building a colony anyway. The core gameplay loop is succinct and satisfying, with a steady stream of missions, upgrades and FMV narrative interludes via the display in your habitat. Fundamentally, this is a Metroidvania, staggering your progress and exploration through upgrades and equipment, and it works as well here as it does anywhere else.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is split into a series of open-world planetary maps. They’re not huge, but they’re packed with plenty of verticality, hidden resources and secrets to keep every moment exciting. I still found myself distracted and wandering off at the merest hint of something else beyond the objective in my eyesight, and though the game can easily be completed in 10 hours, there’s plenty of enjoyment to be had roaming the planets and messing with the creatures within.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes over the original game is the shift to a third-person viewpoint, and for a while, I wasn’t sold, losing some of the immediacy that goes hand-in-hand – should that be eye-in-eye? – with first-person. Eventually, though, you find that the action is more straightforward, the platforming more precise, and there’s the opportunity for more visual gags when you can see your character on-screen. Primary amongst them is the amazingly cartoonish run animation – seriously, it’s unlikely to be bettered for a long time.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that for all of the forlorn, lonely and downright downtrodden emotions surging through the opening of the game, you can play the entirety of it in co-op, both online or via splitscreen. As with pretty much any other multiplayer game, it’s better with a friend, sharing in the hilarity or the humiliation at the hands of a giant crab. There are some limitations – you can’t be on separate planets for example, you’re only progressing one player’s save file, and it’s not seamless drop-in, drop-out, so a co-op session is ended if either of you leaves –&nbsp;but they’re minor foibles that don’t diminish any of the fun and frolics.</p>

<p>Whether in co-op or playing solo, the true high point for Revenge of the Savage Planet remains its sense of humour. It regularly had me in fits of laughter, no doubt upsetting the delicate ears of my co-op partner, and everything, from the ‘juiciest burgers in the world’ advert that has people being sprayed in the face by their food, to the Shama Llama’s Ding Dong Academy that pokes merrily at the influencers’ underbelly – featuring an unexpected cameo from Unbox Therapy’s Lewis Hilsenteger – hits home with clear and cutting intent.</p>
<p>Some of the adverts are so ludicrous, so dystopian, that you can’t believe they’d exist, but as with the best satire, the very fact that they’re even vaguely plausible casts a light on the realities of consumerism, greed and corporate irresponsibility in the modern world. You just have to hope that Raccoon Games are wholly wrong about it all, though I do quite fancy a burger.</p>
<p>There’s some rough edges that we hope are patched out soon, a few minor kinks to the collision detection, a point where the animal capture ability wasn’t working and we needed to reload the save, and other technical hitches, but by and large they don’t affect the enjoyment of the game.</p>

			<p>Ever since FromSoftware's Souls series started rising in popularity, the vast majority of action role-playing games developed by smaller and more established studios have been inspired in some capacity by the Japanese developer's franchise. While many of these games are great experiences on their own, they highlighted how the genre is suffering from some homogenization, where very few are the games that try to break from the mould and offer something different. For this reason, I could not help but appreciate Empyreal's approach to the genre <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-hands-on-preview-an-arpg-of-a-different-kind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when I first tried it in February</a>.</p>
<p>While the game doesn't leave a great impression going from the visuals alone, some of its gameplay mechanics felt unique enough to give the game a very peculiar identity. Even then, however, I felt that there could have been some issues, but I expected elements to come together better once I could experience the game from the very beginning and go through the onboarding process. Unfortunately, experiencing Empyreal from the beginning only made it more evident how these issues result in a game more frustrating to play than fun.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502164603_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Empyreal is set on an unnamed, unexplored planet where a colossal structure known as the Monolith has been discovered. As the first Expedition that set foot on the planet quickly realized, this Monolith isn't just something left behind by a lost civilization, but a mysterious place that is still very much alive, filled with powerful automatons and all sorts of dangers that feel geared towards preventing anyone from reaching its deepest recesses. With the Expedition on the brink of complete failure, a gifted mercenary reaches the planet to do what it failed to accomplish, and discover what truly lies inside the Monolith that no man should have ever awakened.</p>
<p>From the premise, it's clear that Empyreal's story is somewhat uninspired. It's not particularly bad, to be honest, but it really doesn't feature anything that makes it remarkable. The characters don't fare much better, as they have a paperthin predictable characterization, going from the grumpy Expedition leader with a bone to pick with anyone that isn't a member of the Expedition itself, the helpful but a little airheaded scientist, the welcoming and mostly helpful quartermaster, the wacky merchant and scrapper-meets-blacksmith and so on.</p>
<p>None of them is particularly annoying, to be honest, but they fail to make an impression so much with their limited development and generic design that it is easy even to forget their names. Overall, the story and characters in Empyreal are nothing more than a backdrop to justify the exploration of the Monolith and a way to access some critical services needed to complete the game.</p>
<p>With the story not being particularly involving, nor the characters much endearing, it's clear how developer Silent Games placed greater emphasis on gameplay in Empyreal. During your first trek into the Monolith after creating your character via a character creator featuring a decent selection of options, you will experience a good portion of what Empyreal has to offer: intricate locations with plenty of side paths to explore filled with additional items that can be sold for silver and gear of different rarity and levels, powerful Automaton enemies with varied movesets and configurations that require players to strategize on the fly to deal with the most annoying enemies first before handling everyone else using one of the three weapon types - Glaive, Mace &amp; Shield and the Cannon - and abilities with cooldown mechanics that can be unleashed at will without having to worry about spending resources like AP or MP, and some items coming with both supporting and offensive support.</p>
<p>The game generally does a decent job introducing its central mechanics throughout the first few journeys to the Monolith, and though there's a general clunkiness to movement and attacking, it's easy to see the potential, especially with some of the unique defensive mechanics the game features which combine a relatively straightforward parry and perfect dodge mechanic, depending on the weapon, with a charging bar beneath each enemies' names that indicates when their next attack will go off, almost giving some turn-based feel to the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502174257_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After gathering a few Cartograms, blueprints which determine every aspect of every trek into the Monolith, including level, biome, elemental affinity of enemies, loot table, and bosses, and going through stages a couple of times, however, what was only a thought in the back of the mind becomes reality. Empyreal is a game that's more frustrating to play than fun, due to the average execution of its mechanics. The clunky movement and stiff animations are only two of the reasons the game becomes frustrating fast.</p>
<p>For starters, there is no lock-on, an interesting choice for a game that wants players to go after specific enemies first due to their supporting capabilities that only makes matters more frustrating, as not only the camera needs constant readjusting to have a good view of the battlefield, but enemies also attack from off-screen without any indicator, with a few exceptions, which makes it very difficult to avoid their attacks. In addition, a good portion of these attacks teleport the Automatons to the player or have insane tracking, so unless your parries and dodges are on point, you will eat a lot of damage quickly. The fact that enemies are not staggered by regular attacks and a good number of abilities unless the bar below their health bar has been filled, leaving them staggered and open to a powerful critical attack, often resulting in your character being defenseless after unleashing them.</p>
<p>All of the above often forces players to use hit and run tactics with the two close-range weapons, or in a constant parry and counterattack playstyle that gets very old fast. In addition, even the parry and dodging mechanics feel clunky, as both are mapped to the same button, which is not ideal. As if all this wasn't enough, there are times when some maneuvers go off for no apparent reason. A few times, I had a ranged counterattack with the Glaive going off for no reason during a boss battle, which essentially teleported me towards an untimely death. Ultimately, things get a little better by using items, but too often I felt I was fighting against the mechanics, rather than against the enemies. Even boss battles are not exempt from this. The contrary. Their tendency to constantly call in minions only adds to the frustration, and what could have been challenging duels become a constant hit-and-run fight that's not very fun.</p>
<p>It's a shame the central combat mechanics are not executed too well, as Empyreal does a few things right that would have made fans of classic ARPGs like the Diablo series quite happy. The gear customization system, for example, is well-developed, allowing players almost from the beginning of the adventure to customize their equipment using specific materials that can enhance attributes at the expense of others, randomly roll properties, and more. With an emphasis on elemental properties, Empyreal also offers different slots in which to save loadouts for quick switching, which ultimately incentivizes going into stages with very different elemental properties.</p>
<p>The three weapon types are also quite diverse from one another, and even offer different playstyles in combination with a good selection of abilities obtained by using silver and sometimes items at the blacksmith, which range from purely offensive skills to support skills that also have unique effects by just equipping them. Level design is also varied enough, although things get a little repetitive within a specific biome, which is to be expected, but still, with so many materials to collect, the game does a solid job providing players with a reason to go off the beaten path and to shoot for things other than the final boss of each Cartogram. Even in terms of endgame content, Empyreal gets things right, offering a New Game + mode with an increased level cap for Cartograms, new NPC duels, and an epilogue with a new ending.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502172501_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even if one were to look past some of the issues above and enjoy the best features Empyreal offers, it won't take too long for the gameplay loop to become tiring. Proper multiplayer features may have provided some more incentives to grind, but in this regard, Empyreal doesn't offer much besides some asymmetrical mechanics that allow players to receive gear from other players as a gift, a free immediate respawn during boss battles, and a simple sharing and trading system for items and Cartograms. In conjunction with the frustrating combat, this makes it almost pointless to delve deeper into anything that isn't strictly story-related.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Empyreal doesn't exactly strike a good impression as the Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals are not very good. While some of the biomes inside the Monolith have a distinct look, most of the game's locations aren't particularly good-looking. The worst offender is definitely the main camp, which looks terribly generic and almost lifeless with its flat lighting. The character and enemy models don't fare much better, as they are just as uninspired and dull as the main camp.</p>
<p>Empyreal also leaves something to be desired in terms of performance on PC. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran considerably worse than I expected, given the undemanding visuals it pushes, struggling to run past the 90 FPS average range at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode, no Frame Generation and high settings. A benchmark session held in an area generated in the Monolith's first biome, Man &amp; Church, using a mid-game Cartogram ran at an average of 93 FPS and 16 FPS 1% low, which is way below what a system with those specifications should have delivered in an undemanding game.</p>
<p>I did not experience any major stuttering, to be honest, so the experience was playable, but systems with lower specifications than mine may have some trouble running the game properly, even with the supported upscalers, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and UE5's TSR, and frame generation tech, DLSS and FSR.</p>

<p>Empyreal took only around 18 hours to complete, but many of these hours were not particularly enjoyable. While the game has a few things that work well, they are not enough to salvage an experience that could have been something more than the frustrating one that ended up being. With some tweaks to combat and maybe proper multiplayer, the experience crafted by Silent Games has the potential to become something else, so I sincerely hope the studio will have the opportunity to do so, as some of the ideas implemented in the game are definitely solid.</p>

				<p>Empyreal's ambition to do something different is commendable, but it's ultimately the only thing it truly has going for it. While character customization and the Cartogram system are solid enough, the forgettable and generic story and characters, average and clunky combat and the lack of proper multiplayer mechanics make the game a frustrating experience that gets tiring very quickly and one that only the most diehard ARPG fans might briefly appreciate.</p>

			<p>If anyone thought the recent confirmation of a GTA VI delay (the game's launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been moved</a> from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026) would harm its hype, the first viewership registered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second trailer</a> will make them reconsider.</p>
<p>According to Rockstar Games (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Hollywood Reporter</a>), the trailer that suddenly aired two days ago surpassed 475 million views across all platforms in the first twenty-four hours. This makes it the most-viewed trailer of all time, not just among games but across all entertainment, beating the previous record of Deadpool vs. Wolverine, which stopped at 365 million views. The recent trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps registered around 200 million views in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>For comparison, the first GTA VI trailer only garnered 93 million views. However, it was a YouTube exclusive, and it still managed to become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most-viewed non-music video of all-time on the platform</a>, second only to a couple of songs from the South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
<p>That trailer also helped bring its featured song (Love Is a Long Road, made by Tom Petty) to the top of the music charts, and the same is true this time around with the new trailer's song, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters. According to Spotify, the song's popularity grew by 182,000% (not a typo) following the debut of the GTA VI trailer.</p>
<p>Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s global head of editorial, stated:</p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else. Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, Rockstar Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the trailer was captured on Sony's PlayStation 5 hardware with a mix of gameplay and cutscenes. Given how great it looked, that's highly reassuring. PlayStation 5 Pro users may get even better visuals or higher frame rate options.</p>
<p>As for PC, Rockstar hasn't said anything about the platform's launch window yet, but a prominent manufacturer of PC gaming peripherals <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> GTA VI should be released only a few months after the console debut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2019’s Death Stranding transcended the framework of ordinary video games by metaphorically depicting cosmology and even anthropology through the act of delivery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a game that challenged the idea of human connection through refreshing gameplay mechanics that fundamentally reexamined the very act of movement. To me, Death Stranding was an undeniable masterpiece that delivered a viscous flow of concepts. Now that I’ve played its sequel for more than 30 hours at a special press event at Kojima Productions’ Tokyo office, I am starting to realize that it may have been only the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach can be seen as an attempt to take the premises of the first game to the next level. While taking the player on a journey across the border of the UCA (United Cities of America), its symbolic depiction of connection feels more dynamic yet less certain than its predecessor. What questions will the new journey of legendary deliverer Sam Porter Bridges bring, and how will they be answered?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it was explicitly stated that what I played was not the final version of the game, the playable portions demonstrated a density and completeness you would expect from a final product. Fundamental elements such as movement, dialogue, and presentation are highly integrated, and the intention to expand upon the experience that the first game delivered was evident throughout.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A new beginning in a new land</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first game, Sam reconstructed connections between people while uncovering the truth behind Death Stranding, a mysterious phenomenon that caused disconnection between cities. Through Sam's journey of delivering supplies, players experienced movement in a way video games had not offered before, while the story gradually unfolded its views on life, death, and cosmological visions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setting of Death Stranding 2 moves from the rebuilt UCA to the Mexican border region. Bridges, the organization that previously handled delivery operations, has withdrawn from delivery, and instead, an automated delivery system called APAS is now operating with unmanned vehicles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sam was living quietly with his daughter Lou in a remote area of Mexico, but at the request of Fragile, another returning character, he takes on delivery missions again in this region where the communication infrastructure is undeveloped. A new journey quietly begins to reconnect the Chiral Network, a communication network similar to the internet.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Photorealistic modeling and subtle facial expressions of characters have also largely improved from the first game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The photorealistic graphics that meticulously depict Mexico's desolate land are nothing short of impressive. From the texture of the dried surface to faintly rippling sand dust and rocky mountains in the distance, Death Stranding 2’s visuals drew me in right away. Photorealistic modeling and subtle facial expressions of characters have also largely improved from the first game, and the art style creates an aesthetic that transcends mere realism, forming a powerful foundation supporting its surrealistic worldview and story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The part that plays in Mexico functions more or less like a tutorial, not just in terms of gameplay, but also story and settings. While the first one overwhelmed players with numerous terms and settings in its early hours, Death Stranding 2 is conscious of being accessible even without prior knowledge. The sequel also offers a recap mode in novel style narrated by Deadman.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Death Stranding left a strong impression by overwhelming players with a vast amount of information from the beginning. By doing so, it undeniably confused more casual players not used to such a convoluted story. In contrast, Death Stranding 2 introduces a glossary function called Corpus, showing careful consideration for players who have not played the first game or those who did but found it too complicated.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">An evolution of the delivery system</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel that the game design of Hideo Kojima's works often comes in three layers. For example, the Metal Gear series’ gameplay consists of infiltration, danger, and stealth while its movement can be divided into walking, crouching, and crawling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same philosophy can also be seen in Death Stranding. For example, your scanning device Odradek visualizes terrain danger levels in three different colors. Death Stranding 2 follows the same rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in the original, the player once again has to manage cargo weight and balance while traversing unstable natural terrain. Footing must be secured on slopes, while the center of gravity must be controlled to avoid being swept away in rapid water streams. The risk of cargo damage is present throughout the process, which makes traversing the world itself a nerve-wrecking task.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Constructions such as ropes and ladders can be used to traverse the world more conveniently. These infrastructures go beyond individual player experiences, as structures installed by other players are shared in the world as the Social Strand System. As you make use of ladders and bridges left by someone else, the solitary exercise of delivery gradually transforms into a more connected and social experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to highways, Death Stranding 2 allows the player to construct monorails too, which makes traversing its world a lot smoother. Highways and monorails require a lot of materials, forcing the player to utilize the mines to gather materials. As a result, establishing trade routes has become more central to gameplay than it was the first time around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While traversing the world itself has become more convenient, environments have become more challenging in return. The width of rivers can double due to rainfall, while natural hazards such as earthquakes called “gate quakes” and sandstorms can occur. As a new feature, the time of the day also changes in real time, which causes additional challenges for Sam. These natural elements interfere with player actions in various ways, such as footing collapsing due to flooding and earthquakes, or visibility worsening due to sandstorms and nightfall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A new system called APAS Enhancement allows you to use skill points to enhance stats and obtain new abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To overcome these conditions, the sequel also boasts more room for customization. The “Porter Grade” indicates Sam’s current proficiency in a more direct way, while a new system called APAS Enhancement allows you to use skill points to enhance stats and obtain new abilities. From weapon power enhancement to weather analysis and footprint erasure, you can choose to have Sam specialize in either delivery, movement or combat skills. That means that while preparing your cargo was pretty much the only thing you could do to get ready for a new delivery in the first game, you can now also prepare by customizing Sam’s abilities according to your preference.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sam’s skills show that once again, Kojima is utilizing three layers of gameplay in which the player can tackle the game’s missions and obstacles. However, while delivery, movement and combat skills can all be customized, combat plays a greater role in Death Stranding 2. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">New enemies and a deeper combat system</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, meanwhile, occurs much more frequently and has become more flexible in Death Stranding 2. In the first game, combat was limited and functioned merely as a way to secure supplies or to make your way through bases. Death Stranding Director’s Cut already added infiltration missions into Mule bases, but Death Stranding 2 builds more varied stages and systematized combat in the open world, seemingly as an extension of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New human enemy forces such as Bandits and Armed Survivalists appear, and their bases are designed as stages with simple three-dimensional structures. When infiltrating these bases, players are often forced to engage in combat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BTs, or creatures that appeared due to the Death Stranding phenomenon, also have new types. Larger BTs with stronger attacks make the combat more challenging than it was last time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat has become more tactical as well. By throwing a speaking doll called Dollman, you can observe the insides of bases from above to grasp enemy placement and movement lines. While close combat remains important, remote stealth attacks with the Blood Boomerang, precision shooting with sniper rifles, and utilizing assault rifles and grenade launchers give the player a multitude of new options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's even possible to put down Sam’s backpack, allowing for more agile and nimble movement by completely separating him from his cargo. Weight management directly connects to mobility, which greatly enhances tactical flexibility.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether to engage in direct combat, choose stealth or avoid combat altogether, freedom of approach has increased when compared to the first game. The APAS Enhancement even allows you to refund skill points, welcoming trial and error to find the playstyle that suits you best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 has four difficulty settings – Story, Casual, Normal (which I played), and Brutal – providing flexibility in how much you want to invest in the game’s expanded combat as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Did the trailers say too much?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As partially revealed in trailers, after a series of dramatic events, Sam will cooperate with Drawbridge, a civilian company established by Fragile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setting moves from Mexico to Australia, and a journey to spread the Chiral network begins once again. A mobile base called DHV Magellan (Deep-Tar Hunting Vessel), named after the explorer Ferdinand Magellan who travelled around the world, functions as a hub for the player.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name DHV Magellan suggests, the story steps into themes reminiscent of colonial domination. Furthermore, the rise of a private political organization called APAC (Automated Public Assistance Company) shows similarities with the PMC (Private Military Company) depicted in Metal Gear Solid 4. Since I haven't witnessed the story to its conclusion, it is too early to speculate on how these motifs will come to fruition in the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Death Stranding, people were isolated and only porters traversed the dangerous outside world, which has been noted by many as a portrayal that seemed to foresee the Covid-19 pandemic. In Death Stranding 2, the APAC seems to resonate with recent movements of America's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). With such eerie points of convergence with reality, I can't help but feel that there is a significance worth noting in contemporary times regarding how connections will be redefined in Death Stranding 2.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As the name DHV Magellan suggests, the story steps into themes reminiscent of colonial domination.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of particular note is the presence of actor Luca Marinelli, who plays a mysterious man. Both Marinelli’s acting ability and the presentation of scenes he appears in leave a strong impression. The mystery of who this man is and why he stands in Sam's way will have players speculating for sure. Marinelli and his character are just as captivating as Mads Mikkelsen’s Cliff was in the first game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One concern I had during my 30 hours with the campaign was that I realized that the trailers contain content that delves quite deeply into the main story, to the extent that a lot of what happened throughout the game I was already somewhat aware of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it be that too much has been given away in the trailers? Or is there a big surprise awaiting players when Death Stranding 2’s full picture is revealed? We can only eagerly await the game’s June 26 release.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Metal Gear Solid mastermind Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding established the two opposites of division and connection as its themes during a pre-pandemic world, and its highly conceptual story structure and innovative delivery- centered movement mechanics blew open new possibilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now in its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, he poses the same question in an even more complicated form: "Should we have connected?" With its June 26, 2025 release quickly approaching, we wanted to know what kind of position Kojima had taken when creating its story now that the divisions in our world only continue to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development of Death Stranding 2 proceeded under the unprecedented circumstances of the Covid pandemic. How exactly did Kojima reconsider the meaning of "connection" and reconstruct it while being forced to reckon with his understanding of technology, production environments, and the nature of our <br>relationships with one another?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/gettyimages-2204212002-1746647578565.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima will soon release Death Stranding 2. Photo by Lorne Thomson/Redferns.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview, Kojima talks about his philosophy framing the game's production, what was left behind in the previous game and carried on to the new one, and contemporary society and its relationship to his games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Locations and New Elements</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What were you trying to accomplish for Death Stranding’s sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> I'd like to ask you to think back to the beginning of Metal Gear Solid. No weapons appear at first, and you only acquire them after going up the elevator. Placing weapons at the very start will cause players to pick them up and start killing enemies, so we consciously decided to not do that. But that part turned out to be unpopular, with some people saying they couldn't get up the elevator. Still, we had to design Metal Gear Solid so that players learned how stealth works. For Metal Gear Solid 2, we made it a little easier to use weapons and aim at specific parts using a POV angle, as many players were already aware of stealth games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was the same for Death Stranding. There aren't many games about delivery, so we first had to get people accustomed to it first. For the sequel, we wanted to allow players that want to fight to do so more freely. Players can use weapons, and it's now easier to drive cars and motorcycles. For the story, the first game was about Sam and Cliff, but this time one of the main themes is Lou and what her existence means.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Death Stranding depicts deeply emotional themes such as loss and sorrow. Are these based on your own experiences?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> About half of what I create is based on real experiences, while the other half is based on fictional experiences. Themes like where people go when they die come from a very private place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What made you choose Mexico and Australia as new locations for Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> I can’t say too much, but first of all, Mexico is contiguous to the UCA, and there was a need to connect to neighboring cities. As Sam says many times, it's possible that it could lead to an invasion. In the first game, players connected  America from east to west. This does mirror the pioneer age, but are we going to do the same thing when making the sequel? My initial thought was to do something  completely different, which was a story about cutting off connections. But doing that would mean reusing the setting and environment of the first game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My thought process was that we needed a continent that's about as long across as North America that faces the ocean to both the north and south. Eurasia would be too large, and Africa wasn't right either. After thinking about it, I decided on Australia. I came up with the concept of Plate Gate as a desperate measure being used to connect it. We could potentially keep on creating sequels if we use this approach, but there aren't any plans to make any.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why did you decide to add the concept of there being both night and day?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> We did this in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain as well, but I wanted to properly include the passage of time in an open world. Gazing at the sky as the sun rises and sets is something that couldn’t been done in the first game, in part due to engine-related reasons, but it's been put into the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Night scenes were far too dark at first, so we changed a lot when it comes to lighting. Cutscene lighting changes depending on the time of day too. It wasn't easy building a game that could account for that. There are times when I want to use film-like backlighting in specific scenes, but this is a game, not a movie. What's being seen will change based on the player. I'd personally like you to play certain cutscenes at night, but it's fine if you see them at another time of the day too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also included the option to go to bed and wait for the morning before leaving. This is something we've been sure to include because I imagine there will be players that don't want to travel at night. Metal Gear Solid V had a system where you could smoke to advance time, but this game does it in more natural ways, like going back to bed in a private room after waking up once.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Kojima Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It felt as though there's an emphasis on strategic combat in Death Stranding 2. What kind of effect did this change have on the game's design and storytelling?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> It's not that I'm simply pushing combat. The game is still fundamentally about cargo delivery, but combat has become more flexible. Players have the choice to take a detour around enemies or use a car or motorcycle so as not to encounter them. This does mean there's a need for new weapons as well, though. Some of the staff on Death Stranding 2 worked with me on the Metal Gear series, so there were times when people worried that it was getting a little Metal Gear-ish. My personal explanation for it is that we simply pursued more enjoyable combat. This is actually connected to the theme of "we should not have connected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This even relates to war. Our world today is connected by a rope that is the internet. But at the same time there’s conflict going on in the world. We ultimately can't connect to each other in harmless and inoffensive ways alone. Higgs tells you that ropes on their own are not enough. Maybe we also need sticks to connect with one another. The story keeps on progressing in that direction. That doesn’t mean that you will be forced into stealth. I don't even use stealth myself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Social Strand System and how it connects to real-life social media</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Were you ever surprised by what players did with the Social Strand System in the first game? If so, how did that affect the production of Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> Whether players would really use the Social Strand System or not was an unknown to us. When I play the game myself, I use ladders and make bridges, but I don’t build any of the highways; I just use what someone else made. That's why I was concerned if people would really make roads themselves when the game came out, but it turned out that a lot of people did nothing but that. That was a pleasant <br>surprise for me. I wanted to make sure that the sequel would have more interesting things to do for those players as well. The monorail is one such element. One point of debate within the team when making the first game was likes. They aren't a form of currency, and they don't make you stronger. Staff members reacted negatively to that, but I placed importance on how good it feels to receive likes even <br>if they don't have any value, similar to how that feels in real life. It's a strange game design choice, you know. But even the staff members who were against it at first ended up being pleased by the implementation in the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know how systems like these will be received until the game actually comes out and we see everyone's reactions. For the Director's Cut, we took a look at player data and decided what to remake based on the points for improvement we found there. This sequel is being developed based on the player behaviour. Personally, though, I wanted players to put down their cargo more often when they  <br>fight. Even when we had people test the game out, a lot of them tended to believe that they'd lose their cargo since that may happen in the real world, but we didn't make many changes to that part of the game during that time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You are known to be active on social media, but it seemed as though there was a shift in theme between these two games. The first Death Stranding was about people connecting, while Death Stranding 2 asks if we really should be connected.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> Death Stranding was developed before the pandemic. There were movements toward division at the time such as the United Kingdom leaving the EU, and so both its story and gameplay were created based on my thoughts on that during that time. But then Covid started three months after making the game, and I was truly shocked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now in the 21st century, though, we have the Chiral Network... which is to say the internet. Spanish flu struck in the early 20th century, but we were able to survive this time because we were connected by the internet. We started working remotely, while concerts and live events vanished. We had no choice but to rely on the Internet. Children couldn't go to school or play and had to stare at screens all day. I think we didn't have any other choice at the time. You'd turn on the TV and hear about how the metaverse was the next big thing, but that isn't how human communication works. You don't meet people by chance that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So in other words, your thoughts about social media have changed, and that's being reflected in this title?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> This may sound strange, but I made the first game based on the theme of, "We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect." Then Covid hit after it came out. After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it’s not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings, including "the stick and the rope." I think there are portions that players <br>will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The logo for the first Death Stranding features strands dangling underneath the logo. These are meant to represent connection, but the strands dangle from above the logo for the second game. It’s kind of like the logo for The Godfather. This applies to Dollman too, and you'll find enemies dangling from strands if you go to the weapons factory as well. I added a lot of moments that will make players aware of the presence of different strands. When you really think about it, what does it mean to be connected? I hope you'll play the game when it comes out at the end of June. You've all gone through Covid, so there should be something to resonate with for everyone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Casting and Collaborating with Artists</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did you approach and find new cast members for Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> As we show you in the opening, Fragile shows up when Sam and Lou are living together. That was something I wrote while we were still making the previous game. I told Léa (Seydoux) in January 2020 that I wanted her to appear in the sequel. But due to the pandemic, we were unable to record, leading to a delay at the time. At least we were able to release the PC version and the Director's Cut during that period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this game was made during the pandemic, the process took four to five years. This involves scanning and digitizing, choosing costumes, and more. It's not as if we can shoot everything in one three-month period like a film. It had to be done at regular intervals while making everything else, and it's pretty tough work. What determines whether you can work with someone in this kind of situation is your mutual bond. I start with the people I like, the people who I like to see in films, and the people I want to work with. I go and meet these people directly. We'll end up knowing each other for a while, and so over the course of having meals with them and such I'm able to decide whether or not I want work with them, and that's when I'd figure out the details through their agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lindsay Wagner, who played Amelie, is someone I loved since I was young, but a younger staff member responsible for her (CG) data didn't know who she was. They said that as they saw her face each day, though, they ended up becoming a fan. In fact, by the time  production was nearing its end, they had bought the Blu-rays for The Bionic Woman. So that’s how I select the actors. I do auditions sometimes, as well, but it’s more about the connection. It’s the same for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">OD</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, and other projects, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are there any cast performances in Death Stranding 2 that you like in particular?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> That would have to be Neil and Lucy. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-cast-his-solid-snake-alike-for-death-stranding-2-to-try-and-surpass-mads-mikkelsen">Neil is played by Luca (Marinelli)</a>, and I actually made a comment promoting Martin Eden, which he's in. When I did that, Luca emailed me in English himself, saying that he had been a fan of mine since he was young and that he'd read what I wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will probably let down fans of Mads (Mikkelsen), but it wouldn't be right for Cliff to return in the sequel because his story has already come to an end. That means I needed to cast someone who can surpass his performance, though I wondered if that’s even possible. That's when I thought of Luca and made him an offer. At the time I was trying to find someone who could play Lucy as a counterpart to <br>Neil, only for Luca to ask if I had already decided on his partner. When I said no, he suggested his wife. His wife, Alissa Jung, isn't just an actress but also a film director. When I met her in person, she seemed perfect to play a counsellor and so I offered her the role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we ended up filming Neil and Lucy's scenes, most of them involved the two characters on their own, which was kind of interesting. Luca is a stage actor as well, while Alissa is an actress and film director. There were times when they tried to put me aside and direct themselves!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You need a lot of people when working in a performance capture studio, such as makeup artists, record-keeping staff, and more. They were all spellbound during Neiland Lucy's scenes. That had never happened before, which goes to show just how amazing the scenes we captured were.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 - Release Date Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did your collaboration with Woodkid, whose music is included in the game, come about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> When I was on my way back to my hotel during a January 2020 trip to Paris, I was introduced to Woodkid as a musician who was a fan of mine. He asked if I would listen to the music he was working on. The song was Goliath, and it was incredible. The song hadn't come out yet, and I fell in love with his music from then on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I returned to Japan and watched his music videos, I was shocked to see a world featuring beach-like scenery and whales, just like Death Stranding's. Ryan Karazija, the frontman of Low Roar who I collaborated with in the previous game, had passed away and I didn't know what to do for the sequel's music, but when I offered that role to Woodkid he gladly accepted it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like I was worried about who would replace Mads, I was worried about the music, and I've gotten texts asking if it's really possible to create a musical experience better than Low Roar's.  It was received very well worldwide, and Woodkid said to me for the first time that he actually had felt immense pressure that people would say they don’t like it and reject him because it wasn’t Low Roar, but he was assured after seeing the positive response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you go about selecting which songs to use in a game? How much of your personal taste in music is reflected in that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> Like the previous game, I've asked Ludvig Forssell to handle the soundtrack. Of course, Woodkid's songs are in there, too. I pick musicians who I listen to and enjoy regularly. Similar to casting, I contact them directly and get permission to use their music, or they'll let me know that they want to write a new song for me that I then use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What was the most rewarding part of creating Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> I wrote the proposal for this game while isolated during the pandemic and worked on it with people whose faces I couldn't see for the most part, only really meeting Yoji Shinkawa once a week. I imagine the same went for any studio. If we can't all gather and we can't shoot, what should we do? But even under those circumstances, I was fortunate to have everyone's help as we made progress on the <br>game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd say it was around 2021 when we seriously began performance capture work. But I wasn't allowed to go to the Los Angeles studio at the time and had to connect there remotely from Tokyo to direct the actors there. I used my smartphone, my iPad, and all kinds of cameras, but directing remotely really did drive me mad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just when I didn't know what to do, someone from Sony HQ let me borrow two window-like monitors that make two-way voice communication possible, which allowed me to find a way to record. It still wasn't easy, though. When someone's working right next to you, you're able to make discoveries and realizations about what to do. But if you're working fully remote, there are a lot of times when the timing<br>or details of a report get delayed. Even if someone makes a mistake, it isn't noticed right away. Still, I think we'll find a way to make it safely over the finish line. At the time, I really thought that it wouldn't be possible to complete the game. So what has been the most rewarding? I think I’m just really happy that we can finish making the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Thank you for your time.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lorne Thomson/Redferns.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Rockstar may have nudged the release date of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> back into 2026, but that doesn't mean interest has faded in any way, shape or form.</p>
<p>The second trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 blasted its way past 475m views across platforms in just 24 hours. This makes the trailer the biggest video launch of all time, Rockstar told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p>To put that figure into more perspective, the publication notes the trailer for Deadpool and Wolverine was viewed 365m times in its first 24 hours, while The Fantastic Four: First Steps debuted to more than 200m.</p>

<p>The first GTA 6 trailer was released all the way back in December 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-proves-its-dominance-as-trailer-breaks-youtube-records">clocked up 93m views in the first 24 hours</a>, which is significantly less than the second trailer. The first trailer was exclusive to YouTube, however, and at the time of writing the second trailer only has 84m views on the platform. I say 'only' like it is nothing, but let's be honest, this is still hardly an insignificant number by any stretch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and as has been the case with many songs, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters has additionally seen a boost since it was featured in the latest GTA 6 trailer. Spotify said streams of the song had risen by 182,000 percent since its release.</p>
<p>"Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else," Sulinna Ong, Spotify's global head of editorial, said in a statement. "Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way."</p>
<p>Following the second trailer's debut, Rockstar updated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">GTA 6's website with details on the upcoming game's cast and locations</a>. Then yesterday, the developer confirmed the latest GTA 6 trailer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-gta-6s-latest-trailer-was-gameplay-and-cutscenes-captured-entirely-in-game-on-ps5">a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May</a> 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has forecast 15m sales of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> console over the remainder of this financial year.</p>
<p>The console will launch next month and, by March 2026, Nintendo has predicted 15m console sales and 45m sales of software, according to its latest financial report.</p>
<p>The original Switch console sold 14.87m units in its first year on sale (Q4 FY17 - Q3 FY18), meaning Nintendo is predicting its new console will sell quicker.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hopes-to-beat-switch-sell-20m-switch-2-consoles-in-first-year-analysts-say">Analysts had predicted Switch 2 sales of over 20m</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo recently admitted demand "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">Trump's tariffs in the US</a> will also impact sales.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch console, hardware sales are down 31.2 percent year-on-year, while software sales are down 22.2 percent year-on-year. This is expected as the console nears the end of its life cycle and its follow-up has been announced.</p>
<p>Total lifetime sales for the Switch 1 are now at 152.12m units, just behind the DS at 154.02 units. The number of annual Switch 1 users has dipped slightly from 129 million to 128 million, but remains high.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> has sold particularly well, reaching 7.48m units. This makes it the fastest-selling game in the series on Switch, although <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party">Super Mario Party</a> hit lifetime sales of 20.1m. Still, Jamboree will see a second life with its Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>Sales of other new games in the last fiscal year include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> (3.7m), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> The Thousand Year Door (1.9m), Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership (1.6m), Luigi's Mansion 2 (1.6m), and Donkey Kong Country Returns (1m).</p>
<p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, meanwhile, has sold a further 6.2m copies this financial year. Its lifetime sales are now 68.2m copies, ahead of Switch 2's flagship launch game Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>Interestingly, digital sales increased by 3.3 percent year-on-year, with 62.9 percent of software sales being digital in the last quarter. Sales of Nintendo games have traditionally been physical, but this slowly appears to be changing - perhaps more with Switch 2 considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">most third-party physical releases don't have the game on the card</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Nintendo's report reconfirms a "late 2025" release for Pokémon Legends Z-A and "2025" release for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond across both Switch and Switch 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has released its financial report for the financial year 2025, and it has some interesting stats. What we know is that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed 152 million units sold, making it second to the Nintendo DS which had over 154 million units sold. When it comes to the Switch 2, Nintendo is forecasting 15 million hardware sales in financial year 2026, which runs from April 1st 2025 to March 31st 2026. On top of that, Nintendo expects 45 million software sales for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>As you would expect, after the Switch 2 launch Nintendo does forecast a drop in sales for the Switch for financial year 2026. The company expects the hardware sales numbers to shrink by 58.3% compared to financial year 2025, to a total of 4.5 million. That would leave the Switch on course to hit 156 million units sold, which would make it the best selling Nintendo console ever. Nintendo also expects a drop in software sales for the Switch by 32.4% to 105 million units from 155.41 million units. The drops in both of these have been forecast to be made up by the Switch 2 hardware and software sales.</p>
<p>Speaking of software, Nintendo confirmed that 24 titles sold over a million copies in financial year 2025, with 15 being first party titles and 9 being third party titles. Of the new titles, Super Mario Party Jamboree hit 7 million sales, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 3.7 million sales, Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door 1.9 million sales, both Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD hit 1.6 million sales, while Donkey Kong Country Returns HD hit a million sales. For Switch software lifetime sales, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leads the pack with 68.2 million sales, followed in second place by Animal Crossing: New Horizons at 47.82 million sales, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate in third with 36.24 million sales. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has reached 32.81 million sales on Switch, while follow up The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is at 21.73 million. Pokémon Scarlet/<br>
Pokémon Violet has hit 26.79 million, just beating Pokémon Sword/Pokémon Shield which came in at 26.72 million sales.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2 release date is set for June 5th 2025</a>, so only a month away. Pre-order stock is currently sold out everywhere at the moment.</p>

                <p>My first go-round with Death Stranding was a complicated one.</p><p dir="ltr">Longtime fans of Hideo Kojima were salivating at the prospect of the first project coming out of his post-Konami studio. No one knew quite what to expect. Early trailers didn’t help much. Was this just … a delivery game? Were we in store for a Metal Gear Solid 2-like gotcha moment when we played the final product? Not really! It was, in many ways, a “delivery game.” Albeit one wrapped in a narrative and universe that made Metal Gear Solid (samurai President clones and all) seem like a realistic depiction of tactical stealth action by comparison.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2 - On The Beach Trailer Full Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I hated it. I don’t know what I expected or wanted out of this new IP, but something about holding the trigger buttons to lean left and right to avoid falling over instantly turned me off. I found the game monotonous, needlessly obtuse, and described it in a way only a veteran games writer could. Namely, I went on podcasts and said it “****ing sucks” and also “sucks s**t.” There’s a reason people pay me to talk about video games.</p><p dir="ltr">Seven or eight hours in, I dropped it. It wasn’t until the Director’s Cut two years later that I decided to give it another shot. I walked past the living room and saw my wife playing it, and she was carefully approaching a river and scanning it with her Odradek (the little flappy scanner thing on Sam Porter Bridges’ shoulder). It seemed too perilous to cross the deep water with all the cargo she was carrying, so she continued down the river bank until she saw a safer path forward.</p><p dir="ltr">This shouldn’t have been a eureka moment for anyone, as examining the land and delivering packages with caution is one of the main things the game tasks you with. However, I had rushed through my original experience with Death Stranding in order to meet a coverage embargo. I sprinted from objective to objective in order to see as much of the game as possible so that I could talk about it on a podcast in a timely manner. Turns out that’s not the way to play it! So I gave the Director’s Cut a shot, took my time with it, and was quickly ashamed of my words and deeds. Death Stranding is a great game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490428-1%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490428" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490428-1%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490428"></a><figcaption>Death Stranding 2 has a star-studded cast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490428-1%286%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I heard I’d be travelling to Tokyo this year to play <em>30 hours</em> of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, I told myself to remember my past mistakes and meet this sequel on its own terms. I would take my time, play it “right,” and hopefully have a better first experience this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">Having played through the original was a huge benefit when it came to my early hours. There was no surprise when I was confronted with the need to balance Sam’s cargo. And since the world had already been exhaustively established in the first game, I wasn’t suffering from constant whiplash when bombarded by one bewildering concept after another. Within the first half hour, a character brings you “the finest chiral-printed diapers” and my brain just registered that as a normal thing to say in this world. It’s like how eventually in Metal Gear Solid, we all just accepted that “nanomachines” as a concept could explain everything from psychics to vampires.</p><p dir="ltr">Let’s back up a bit from the chiral diapers though. You first gain control of Sam Porter Bridges during a tremendous opening sequence, which tasks you to simply “return home with Lou,” the baby from the first game. On paper you’re simply walking across precarious rocky cliffs, but the Kojima magic is hitting you from all angles. Triumphant chanting and drums set the tone as you clamber across cliff faces. A “gate quake” strikes, causing boulders to cascade down the hills around you. Opening credits flank Sam with the signature style of Kojima’s longtime title designer Kyle Cooper. Sure, you may just be walking from Point A to Point B, but I’ll be damned if Kojima doesn’t make it feel <em>cool and important.</em></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490429-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490429" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490429-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490429"></a><figcaption>Vehicles continue to be a great way to traverse flat terrain.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490429-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When Sam finally arrives at his camouflaged shelter in the mountains, we get a glimpse of his new life. It’s 11 months after the events of the first game and he seems to have found something resembling peace. Instead of the sterile private rooms he resided in during his transient past, this shelter feels homey and borderline cozy. Happy pictures of the father and daughter cover the walls, toys are strewn across the floor, and Lou is being fed things other than Monster Energy. But in a trope that Kojima has loved since he presumably saw Commando in 1985, it’s time to pull the grizzled vet back in for <em>one more mission because he’s the only man for the job. </em>For the record, I very much enjoy this trope as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Fragile (not that Fragile) shows up unexpectedly and shatters this sense of calm. Humanity is still on the brink of extinction, Bridges no longer oversees the UCA’s distribution network, Die-Hardman is no longer the President, and Fragile is suffering from “Jumpshock” after too many trips to the Beach.</p><p dir="ltr">I could sit here and try to explain everything going on in that last sentence but thankfully I don’t have to. One of the most welcome additions to Death Stranding 2 is the new Corpus feature. It’s an in-game glossary that can be accessed at any time, even during cutscenes. It’s exhaustive, giving you in-depth explanations on demand regarding the story, terms, characters, and mechanics. A similar system was put to great use in Avowed, and no universe needs it more than this one. I found myself referring to it regularly, and it really did help me gain a further understanding of what was going on and what I needed to do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490430-1%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490430" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490430-1%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490430"></a><figcaption>You'll meet plenty of threats throughout your many journeys. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490430-1%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Your first order of business sounds simple. Sam lives near the border of the UCA (formerly USA) and Mexico, and Fragile wants you to extend the chiral network across the border to a lab operated by Deadman. A giant BT is heading that way, and Fragile offers to babysit Lou so Sam can focus on the mission. I won’t go into the specific story details that influence Sam’s journey this time around, but I will say that the first 7-8 hours of the game take place in Mexico before events ultimately take our crew to Australia. My remaining 20+ hours of gameplay during this event took place here, starting from the West Coast and working my way east. I was told that the 30 hours I played added up to roughly 30-40% of the overall game, so it remains to be seen if more continents lie ahead for Sam.</p><p dir="ltr">Not long into the journey, Sam finds himself on the DHV Magellan, a behemoth of a ship that can navigate tar currents and takes on the distinct appearance of the top half of Metal Gear Rex. Residing on the ship is an expanding motley crew of colorful characters, and their interplay is one of my favorite narrative improvements to the sequel. There was no shortage of interesting characters in the original game, but your interactions with them felt somewhat siloed off. Here’s Heartman’s house where you talk to Heartman. Here’s your private room where Fragile shows up. Here’s Mama’s lab where you talk to Mama. In Death Stranding 2, you frequently find yourself going back to the Magellan and interacting with a group of characters, and it really helps. It’s like the difference between the first three seasons of Arrested Development with the whole cast and that weird fourth one where they could only get like two actors together for any scene.</p><p dir="ltr">The Magellan is piloted by Tarman, whose appearance is modeled on Mad Max director George Miller. He’s missing a hand for reasons you’ll learn in a flashback, and suffers from “phantom pains” as a result (yes, he uses that phrase). My understanding is that because his hand is “dead,” it’s a BT of sorts and that’s why he can pilot through tar and the beach? Look, I’m trying my best here. Also, a tar-covered flying cat follows him around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490431-1%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490431" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490431-1%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490431"></a><figcaption>Help out your fellow players!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490431-1%282%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A talking mannequin torso named Charlie is the mysterious benefactor that funds the DHV Magellan as well as Fragile’s new organization (named Drawbridge). Tomorrow, played by Elle Fanning, is a woman that Sam finds in a different realm. She’s discovered in a golden cocoon of sorts and is virtually silent at first. As she spends time with the crew on the Magellan, she begins to open up and eventually demonstrates some spectacular abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Next up is my guy, Dollman. This dude is the best. He was originally a human man, but somehow his “Ka” (soul) wound up in the “Ha” (body) of a puppet. It doesn’t seem to bother him much, because he just hangs out on Sam’s belt or on a shelf in the Magellan and offers friendly advice and conversation. Every single time I go back to Sam’s room, the first thing I did was see if he had something new to say. And a little pro tip: If he’s interested in any specific song on Sam’s music player, be sure to play it for him.</p><p dir="ltr">At one point, he asked me if I wondered how he maintained his youthful appearance. Despite that not being one of my first 50 questions I’d have regarding Dollman, I heard him out. You see, there’s a woman on the Magellan named Rainy. She’s a pregnant woman that for some reason causes Timefall rain all around her if she steps outside. Timefall rain ages everything it touches, but in a 1.5-meter radius around her body, it actually causes Corefall rain--which makes everything it touches younger. So every once in a while, Rainy will take Dollman into the shower with her. The shower water turns into Corefall, and Dollman is forever young. Simple!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490432-1%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490432" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490432-1%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490432"></a><figcaption>Like its predecessor, this is a pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490432-1%284%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A ton of little moments made me smile or laugh during the event, but it was a moment with Dollman that tickled me the most. He’s dangling off my belt as I approach a river. The poor little guy is trying his best to explain to me the dangers of high water levels, and I confidently decide to start wading in regardless. As he’s mid-sentence, my waist dips below the water level and his friendly advice turns into frantic gurgling as water floods his little puppet esophagus. Like they accomplished with Metal Gear Solid, Kojima and the crew manage to balance a deadly serious (albeit ludicrous) main storyline with moments of incredible comedic sensibility.</p><p dir="ltr">As this is still a bit of a “delivery game” between the cutscenes, the comedy can frequently come from unexpected, unscripted moments. When I first got my tri-cruiser bike, I loaded it up with cargo and excitedly tested out the boost function as I sped out of the garage. I probably should have surveyed the area ahead of time, as I immediately careened off a cliff, crashing the bike and scattering cargo everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">While you’ll eventually have the familiar experience of falling into the river and seeing your cargo helplessly flow downstream, the more frustrating qualities of delivering cargo are significantly reduced this time around. I noticed that I wasn’t having to micromanage my leaning nearly as much, and I rarely fell down. Lou will still occasionally cry, but not with the Yoshi’s Island-like frequency of the first game. I soothed her once or twice in my 30 hours of playing, but it never felt particularly necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Numerous environmental features are introduced, and they’re more cool than frustrating. “Gate Quakes” rattle the earth, while wind storms, rising water levels during rain, “chiral cinder” showers, and forest fires serve to vary up the experience. Trekking through an America that looked like Iceland in the first game was certainly beautiful, but the variety is much appreciated this time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490433-1%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490433" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490433-1%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490433"></a><figcaption>Death Stranding 2 features plenty of new characters in its cast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490433-1%287%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I made a mistake in my early hours, as I played Death Stranding 2 perhaps <em>too </em>similarly to how I played the first game. Lethal combat was discouraged in the original, as killing an enemy ran the risk of creating a “voidout” (massive explosion). As a result, I routed my early deliveries in the sequel to go around enemy camps rather than through them. I avoided combat, but after talking to other press at the event, I learned that I missed an important cutscene featuring a red cyborg samurai that sounded reminiscent of the horrifying introduction to Gray Fox in Metal Gear Solid.</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, I learned that I shouldn’t be avoiding combat. Unless I missed something, there is no risk of creating voidouts as the weapons are non-lethal. Rubber bullets are the standard for your guns, and weapons like “tranq grenade launchers” are the norm rather than lethal alternatives. I unlocked so many weapons in the first game but was afraid to use them because I didn’t want to kill an enemy, so I usually avoided combat or stuck to options like the bola gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Once I retrained myself to play it as a stealth-action game, it greatly improved my enjoyment and I started looking forward to camps of enemies. I snuck up onto some high ground near an enemy outpost and threw Dollman into the air above it. In mid-air, my puppet buddy acted as a surveillance drone of sorts, tagging enemies and notable cargo. After calling him back and thanking him for his service, I tossed a decoy grenade that created some holographic wildlife to distract the bandits. Despite being historically terrible at stealth, I was able to knock out two enemies from behind before blowing my cover and resorting to more direct action. Sprinting around and dodging gunfire, I learned that I could perform pro-wrestling moves like a crossbody block or Kenny Omega’s V-Trigger if I jumped while approaching enemies. A mixture of melee combat and explosives (non-lethal of course) took out the rest of the bandits, I robbed the camp of its cargo, loaded it up onto a stolen enemy vehicle, and drove off to cash it in. I’m not going to say that this game is “MGS V meets Death Stranding,” but it’s certainly a hell of a lot closer to that than the first game was.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490434-1%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490434" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490434-1%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490434"></a><figcaption>Best to customize your backpack for whatever challenges your next journey might task you with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490434-1%283%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even BT encounters are greatly improved. In the first game, frequent BT occurrences would require Sam to hold his breath and sneak around at a snail’s pace if he didn’t want to trigger a frustrating sequence involving trudging through tar as enemies chase you. While that can still happen in Death Stranding 2, you’re much better equipped for the situation. Many weapons are effective on BTs, such as the new Blood Boomerang that siphons blood from Sam and can eliminate BTs with one well-aimed headshot.</p><p dir="ltr">Boss fights are better across the board, including an excellent early encounter with a hulking red mech. An Oblivion-style “Sam’s Stats” feature allows skills like terrain traversal and carrying capacity to level up passively as you play. A new skill tree is introduced that can be respecced on the fly, depending on the situation. Everything in this game is less laborious and more fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back. One chapter--titled “Conflagration”--is one of the most visually stunning sequences I’ve ever seen in a game. Even running on a base PS5, it’s a spectacle that culminates in a boss encounter that rivals the best of Metal Gear Solid. Mechanically, it’s essentially a shootout with a boss and multiple soldiers, but tonally and visually, it’s Kojima firing on all cylinders and it’s truly jaw-dropping.</p><p dir="ltr">I’ve been to countless pre-release events, and in the best-case scenario, it usually winds up with a preview along the lines of, “What I played during my hour-long demo was great, let’s hope the final product can match what they showed off!” But I played 30 hours of Death Stranding 2 before writing this preview. I can confidently say that it’s excellent, and I can’t wait to do it all again (and much more) when it releases next month.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> already has a concept in mind for Death Stranding 3, but doesn't plan to make it himself.</p>
<p>Death Stranding was Kojima's first game from his new studio Kojima Productions, and will be followed up next month by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether Kojima intends for Death Stranding to be a long-running franchise, but there's a new narrative device in the sequel that would allow, plot-wise, for future installments - <strong>some spoilers for Death Stranding 2 follow</strong>.</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A during a preview for Death Stranding 2, Kojima discussed why he chose Australia as the setting for the sequel instead of America, and how this could be expanded further in future games.</p>
<p>"America already has the UCA [United Cities of America], so for the sequel, I debated whether to use the same sort of setting or not," Kojima said. "The first idea I had was that you would have to go around disconnecting everything you connected, because you learn that connecting was a big mistake. But that didn't feel right, as it would just be reusing the same environment."</p>
<p>"I wanted an area that was sprawled from east to west like America and also somewhere that faced the ocean to the north and south. In that case, Eurasia or Africa felt like too big of a continent, but in terms of size and scale, I felt that Australia was a good fit."</p>
<p>Kojima then "squeezed out" an idea of the Plate Gate, which in-game acts as a portal to another continent and allows protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges to travel to new environments.</p>
<p>"If I use this Plate Gate concept, I could make endless sequels!" said Kojima. "I, of course, don't have any plans to do that, but I already have a concept for another sequel. I am not going to make it myself, but if I passed it on to someone else, they could probably make it."</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released on 26th June exclusively on PlayStation 5, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">revealed at Kojima's SXSW panel in March</a> along with a ten minute trailer revealing Luca Marinelli's fake Snake character.</p>
