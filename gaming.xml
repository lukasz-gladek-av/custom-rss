<p>Another year in Fortnite has come to a close, and 2025 saw some huge events, collabs, and memorable moments take place in Fortnite, but how do all of the seasons in 2025 compare when ranked?</p>



<p>Below, Insider Gaming has ranked all the Fortnite seasons that took place in 2025, selecting those that ended this year. As such, Chapter 7 Season 1 is not included despite being released at the start of December.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-2025-fortnite-seasons-ranked">All 2025 Fortnite Seasons, Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-6-chapter-6-season-3-super">6. Chapter 6 Season 3: Super</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not-so-super. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Chapter 5 had a full Marvel-themed season take center stage, Chapter 6’s Super season was anything but what the name suggested and holds the title of the worst season of Fortnite in 2025.</p>



<p>Superman and Robin’s appearance is far from enough to make this season stand out, and the approach of using Epic-created superheroes rather than other licensed DC characters, for example, is very odd.</p>



<p>All in all, it felt like a cheap way to collab with DC amid the release of the latest Superman movie, and the appearance of the Man of Steel, in hindsight, should’ve just been a mini event.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-chapter-6-mini-season-1-galactic-battle">5. Chapter 6 Mini Season 1: Galactic Battle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Far, far from great. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>An annual collab between Fortnite and Star Wars is pretty much guaranteed in May each year, and, while the Galactic Battle mini-season did bring fan-favorite characters like General Grievous and Emperor Palpatine onto the scene, it doesn’t compare to other collabs previously seen from the galaxy far, far away.</p>



<p>Pilotable X-Wings and TIE Fighters were a nice touch, but it didn’t feel like enough to provide a full takeover for an entire mini-season, and the fact that some elements of the season remained throughout the remainder of the chapter felt very weird and out of place.</p>



<p>If Fortnite and Star Wars are planning another collab in 2026, major improvements need to be made.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome">4. Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Shock ‘N Awesome season in Fortnite could have been great, with huge collabs with the Halo franchise and Power Rangers standing out, but it quickly became tiresome, and the feeling cannot be shaken that both franchises could have starred in a more meaningful way.</p>



<p>Both Halo and Power Rangers have the potential and history to be the central focus in a fully-themed season, rather than chucking them together, adding bug-like aliens to the mix, and calling it a day.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-chapter-6-season-2-lawless">3. Chapter 6 Season 2: Lawless</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Crime pays. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Lawless season in Fortnite was a mixed bag overall, but it featured some stellar collaborations, including Mortal Kombat, which added decent elements to the game, such as vault raiding, unlike any content seen before.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Black Market feature was arguably one of the best added, providing a specific means to obtaining weapon and power-ups without defeating bosses or from random loot, and it all made for some entertaining moments.</p>



<p>However, with a theme based around crime, there was definitely missed opportunities for some big collabs.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-chapter-6-season-1-hunters">2. Chapter 6 Season 1: Hunters</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New start. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The debut season of Chapter 6 certainly stands out among the best, with the Japan-themed approach including a beautifully designed map filled with secrets, and major collabs with the likes of Godzilla and Big Hero 6.</p>



<p>Sprites and Boones were a welcome addition to the game, providing perks to earn that provide additional bonuses, along with mechanics including wall running and rolling, though somke were later adjusted.</p>



<p>The Hunters’ season set a high precedent for the rest of Chapter 6, though the bar wasn’t quite met from the following seasons.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-chapter-6-mini-season-2-the-simpsons">1. Chapter 6 Mini Season 2: The Simpsons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Iconic. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Is there really any other option? The Simpsons mini-season that brought an end to Chapter 6 showcased the very best of Fortnite collabs, with an entire map takeover that was excellently crafted, fit into the overall story, and provided heaps of fun.</p>



<p>Putting Springfield into the Fortnite world entirely as a limited-time map, rather than just featuring collabs with characters and a few POIs, was a masterstroke and opens the door for plenty more exciting collabs in the future.</p>

<section><p>The final chapter of DK's latest adventure is a bonanza of nostalgic delight.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Note: MASSIVE spoilers for the final section of Donkey Kong Bananza. Read on at your own risk!</em></p><p dir="ltr">All throughout Donkey Kong Bananza, DK and Pauline are battling Void Company and its leader Void Kong. However, with each new level, there's a reptilian presence permeating the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Some enemies bear a striking resemblance to the Kremlings of DK adventures past, hidden treasure chests are green and bear what look like crocodile teeth, even the Banandium Root--Void Company's main goal in digging through the planet--has a certain familiarity to it I just can't put my finger on.</p><p dir="ltr">In the moment, they feel like simple winks and nods to the older players (like me) who have adventured with DK before. Then, I reach Chapter 15, and the climactic confrontation with Void Kong.</p><p dir="ltr">After a tough battle worthy of a final boss encounter, we see what certainly <em>feels</em> like part of the final cutscene. Pauline saves DK just as he saved her in the beginning of the game, completing her journey from stage-frightened child to confident performer, and the two stand smiling at one another, the Banandium Root just out of view. I'm expecting a fade to black… but then Void Kong charges the Root…</p><p dir="ltr">… he dives toward his prize in order to claim the wish legend says it grants …</p><p dir="ltr">… the music swells, the screen fades to white …</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624077-k-rool-eye.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624077" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624077-k-rool-eye.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624077"></a><figcaption>The eye-opening reveal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624077-k-rool-eye.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">…and then, an eye opens. A massive, vein-ridden, <em>green </em>eyeball fills the screen. Void Kong is punched into oblivion by a scaly green first. The screen shifts to a pair of giant green feet and slowly pans upward, past the massive golden belly that used to be called the Banandium Root, and we see his face, standing in opposition to Donkey Kong, for the first time in <em>18 years</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">King K. Rool has returned.</p><p dir="ltr">He thanks DK for freeing him, and explains that he and his crew had been trapped down there after trying to claim the <em>real</em> Banandium Root for themselves. Now that he's free, he can continue his quest to claim the root. The big croc then jumps one level further into the planet, to its <em>actual</em> core, and the endgame of Donkey Kong Bananza begins.</p><p dir="ltr">Have you ever seen that <a href="https://youtu.be/eJjbnFZ6yA8?si=NmtYAa1817s_Sslp&amp;t=635" rel="nofollow ">old WWE clip of Stone Cold Steve Austin returning to help Mankind in 1999</a>? Substitute the sound of glass breaking with the sight of K. Rool's eye opening, and that wild crowd cheer is what played through my head at that moment.</p><p dir="ltr">The setup is fantastic, as the game slowly and routinely plants a seed of memory in your head with the previously mentioned casual references. The approach to Void Kong in Chapter 15, as well as the boss fight itself, feels like a fitting climax to Bananza's story. In the blink of an eye, what seemed like an epilogue turned into one final prologue, and I'm still smiling like an idiot thinking about it as I write this, a full five months after seeing it for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">The nostalgia pops don't end there, however. The surprise 16th layer of the planet is a gauntlet of classic Kremling enemies, each with their original sound effect from the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games. Kremlings make that "awh" sound when you punch them, just as they did when you jumped on them in 1994. The massive bees called Zingers still buzz that staticy buzz, and they still hurt DK if he touches them. The buzzards known as Neckys make the exact same squawking noise when they charge you, which sent me warping back to my childhood like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsEPqUmHDTo">Anton Ego tasting Remy's ratatouille</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in another clever twist, the Kremling grunts found here attack DK and Pauline just as they had in previous layers, when they were the rock monsters hiding gilded skeletons that bore resemblance to the Kremlings of old. With the facade now lifted, it's even more apparent how much of Bananza was telegraphing the Kremling twist right in front of my eyes, and yet I barely gave the hints a second thought.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624045-k-rool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624045" data-ratio="0.575" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624045-k-rool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624045"></a><figcaption>The returned King K. Rool</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624045-k-rool.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is all before you actually get to K. Rool himself, who battles you with his blunderbuss in a fun matchup that, honestly, ends rather quickly. You claim the Root, a massive pile of bananas emerges to take DK and Pauline back to the surface (just go with it), and the credits start to roll. However, in <em>another</em> callback to Donkey Kongs past, these are fake credits with the names of Kremlings instead of developers, and K. Rool rises and gives chase. Chef's kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">The next phase of the battle then begins, as DK fends off a jetpack-piloting K. Rool on his way to the surface. This part is backed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emww2bMS7wM">hard rock version of Gangplank Galleon</a>, K. Rool's original boss battle music from Donkey Kong Country, and this version has dethroned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvcZ1NAivcQ">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate version</a> for the title of "Best Gangplank Galleon rendition of all time" in my humble opinion.</p><p dir="ltr">Once DK and Pauline reach the surface, they emerge in New Donk City from Super Mario Odyssey, adding a second and more recent flavor of nostalgia. K. Rool claims the Banandium Root, floods the city with rotten, mushy bananas, and DK must battle through Kremlings and surging banana mush to confront the conniving croc one last time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624043-k-rool-king-of-rot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624043" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624043-k-rool-king-of-rot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624043"></a><figcaption>K. Rool, King of Rot</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624043-k-rool-king-of-rot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the final battle, K. Rool uses the power of the Root to transform into a massive, banana-fueled version of himself called K. Rool, King of Rot--which sounds as if K. Rool was researching the works of one Hidetaka Miyazaki in his prolonged absence. Once this version of the rotten reptile is defeated, the adventure finally comes to an end, marked by the <em>actual</em> credits this time.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is a master class of mixing nostalgia with new, and creates an experience that will stick with me for a while. Despite the reptilian references sprinkled in every layer of the game, Void Kong is presented as the big bad of the story. He's a constant presence in cutscenes, barking insults at DK while also barking orders at his subjects … much in the same way K. Rool used to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, once Void is defeated, the mask slips off as K. Rool returns, and suddenly it's a trip down memory lane. The previously-mentioned enemies are obvious callbacks, but the different sections of Layer 16 are connected by mine cart rides, while the surrounding golden glow of the Banandium Root's influence has a similar feel to that of running into Kong's Banana Hoard in the original Donkey Kong Country. Seeing K. Rool return in such a wonderfully executed way, and then having that moment enhanced by all of the other callbacks that appear while trying to thwart the returned ruler, is the kind of pure gaming happiness that Nintendo has delivered since the days of my youth.</p><p dir="ltr">Welcome back, King K. Rool. I look forward to our next encounter, whenever that may be. Hopefully, you'll be around for more than just the final challenge.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[9 Biggest PC Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/9-biggest-pc-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396429</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be a mammoth year in gaming, and while PC players won’t be able to jump into the likes of Grand Theft Auto 6 and Marvel’s Wolverine, there are still a whole host of exciting releases on the cards.</p>



<p>PC continues to grow as the platform gets the best of all worlds, with huge platform exclusives alongside major releases from Xbox and PlayStation consoles making their way to the platform, and that trend continues in 2026.</p>



<p>With so many major releases coming in 2026, and more set to be announced as the year progresses, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest games in 2026 that PC players can’t miss.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-pc-games-coming-in-2026">Biggest PC Games Coming in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Five years after the release of Resident Evil Village, and three years since the Resident Evil 4 remake was released, the next major release in the franchise, Resident Evil Requiem, is on the horizon with a February 27 release date, and is set to be one of the biggest titles released across the whole year.</p>



<p>The return of Leon S. Kennedy to the franchise, alongside the option to play in both first-person and third-person modes, is a major draw for the game, and expectations are high following the staggering success Village achieved many moons ago.</p>



<h3 id="h-007-first-light">007 First Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Icon. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s been decades since a truly great James Bond game was released, a staggering fact considering the strength of the franchise, but 007 First Light has the chance to end that barren stretch, with excitement continuing to rise for the title, due to release on March 26.</p>



<p>The game is in good hands with IO Interactive, who make for a perfect hit given their experience with the Hitman franchise, and there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic for the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s been a rollercoaster ride for Hytale fans in 2025, with the game being scrapped by Riot Games before coming back under the ownership of its original creators, and a release into early access is slated for January 13, where it will become one of the first big releases of the year.</p>



<p>Initially, Hytale will be PC only, and players have been warned ahead of time that it’s very much an early access title, with a long road ahead for a full launch, but Hytale could be one of the most important releases in all of gaming since Minecraft’s debut in 2009.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Tokyo drift. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 celebrates a fifth birthday in 2026 and is still widely-regarded as the definitive racing game on the market, and the launch of the sixth game in the series could be the biggest yet, with Japan, long requested by the community to feature as a location, finally taking center stage.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will launch immediately onto PC at the same time as it lands on Xbox Series X|S, and there’s no reason to skip this title, as it could replace the fifth game as the best in the genre for the next few years.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Revival. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s set to be a massive year for Playground Games, with Forza Horizon 6 coming alongside the long-awaited revival of the Fable franchise, which was initially set to take place in 2025 before being delayed. While a precise date in 2026 is not known, it is expected to land next year.</p>



<p>Microsoft has a lot riding on the success of Fable, having seen a lot of its latest exclusives fall flat compared to their rivals, but there’s every hope that the game can set the world alight due to the established love of the franchise and the long wait for it’s return, while the fact it will be available on PC provides another boost.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prequel. Image via The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Gears of War franchise is one of those that has fallen in the eyes of players with recent releases, and, in a bid to get things back on track, the franchise is going back to where it all began in Gears of War: E-Day, a title set 15 years before the events of the first game.</p>



<p>E-Day’s immediate arrival on PC is another situation where players on the platform will benefit from a simultaneous release alongside Xbox, though PlayStation 5 players could also join the gang this time around after the franchise debuted on the Sony console in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Slay The Spire is widely regarded to be one of the best indie games ever made, and there are high hopes for the sequel that is due to release in March 2026.</p>



<p>Slay The Spire 2’s initial launch comes in early access on PC, allowing players to play an integral part in development and building the game to be a worthy successor to the original title.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strategic. Image via Bit Reactor</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a big year in 2026 for the Star Wars franchise, with several major releases on the cards, and Star Wars Zero Company may well be one of the most exciting due to a definitive lack of competition in the genre it is entering and the experience of the devs working on the title.</p>



<p>Developed by Bit Reactor, a studio formed by those who worked on XCOM and major Firaxis Games titles, Zero Company can lean on that experience and the strength of the Star Wars franchise to achieve big success in 2026, luring in both new players and experienced gamers of Strategy titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Fantasy. Image via Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally built as a prequel to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert was adjusted to be its own standalone single-player title during development and is set for release on March 19, where it lands as one of the most highly anticipated titles releasing in 2026.</p>



<p>The open-world title looks stunning from what has been shown off so far, featuring a fantastical land to explore, a variety of weapons to wield, and lots of secrets to uncover, so it stands as a game where players can easily sink hours upon hours of playtime into.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and Chronos: The New Dawn developer Blooper Team kicked off the new year with a mysterious word: remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.</p>
<p>The word popped up as a <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">URL</a> which contains nowt but a timer, which seems to expire on or around Valentine's Day, depending upon where you are in the world. Some letters are capitalised - most are not - and some are bolded. A couple seem to be in completely different fonts, too.</p>

<p>Mooch about in the source file and you'll find links to video files - they seem to do nothing but provide the oscillating patterns of the animated background - but given the copyright notice at the bottom at the page makes absolutely no reference to Konami or the Silent Hill franchise, it looks unlikely that this relates to the Silent Hill 1 Remake.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote>— Bloober Team | Layers Of Fear OUT NOW on Switch 2 (@BlooberTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlooberTeam/status/2006515753176953244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The reason we're reaching for a horror game in oppose to any other genre is that the tweet that directed us to the website on X/Twitter gave the link alongside the text: "dare to peek into the darkness…"</p>
<p>As for what, exactly, remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd could be? It's possible that this pertains to the studio's upcoming Switch-exclusive horror game, but the letters <em>not</em> bolded spell Cronos, leaving some presuming it could be DLC or even a sequel for Bloober's own horror series. Others are <a href="https://x.com/Effetendo/status/2006788616824172581?s=20">hoping</a> for a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a> game, while some fans are just having fun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1q0tk3i/i_think_i_have_some_of_the_words/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">making</a> some <a href="http://v/">bizarre</a> anagrams.</p><p>More interestingly still, fans recently discovered Bloober had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q15g0q/bloober_team_trademarks_onyx_the_dark_grip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">trademarked</a> the name <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019026286">Onyx: The Dark Grip</a> back in 2024, so make of that what you will. The good news is that even if no one deciphers it, we only have 42 days until we find out for sure.</p>
<p>Polish developer Bloober released Cronos back in September and it reviewed well. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Kelsey gave the game four stars in their Cronos: The New Dawn review</a>, calling it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s best original game yet". Bloober recently released an additional, easier difficulty mode for players who want to enjoy the story and worldbuilding with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-easy-mode">less challenging gameplay</a>.</p>

            <guid>1396420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re still in the outer fringes of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a>, so you can still expect a little bit of everything to appear. We’ve got indie takes on classic genres, we’ve got a bit of musical hotel renovation, sci-fi horror, and ambitious multiplayer games within this crop of five…. so what are we waiting for?</p>
<h2>45 –&nbsp;Mars Tactics</h2>
<p><em>PC – May 2026</em></p>
<p>Who doesn’t love a bit of turn-based tactics? The XCOM-alike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mars-tactics">Mars Tactics</a> has a simple story, with Labor Revolutionaries looking to usurp the domineering Capital army, and there’s the traditional back and forth of this genre… except there’s also environmental destruction!</p>
<p><iframe title="New Trailer and Release Date Announcement: May 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPB_1Ngqs9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No good cover within walking distance? Just chuck a grenade to “dig” a whole. Enemies raining down first from a rooftop? How about you blow up half the building? And with a suppressing fire system as well, there’s plenty of new and fresh tactical options to take advantage of.</p>

<h2>44 –&nbsp;There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>While it might start off as a quirky hotel renovation game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</a> soon reveals its true colours, whipping up a story about strange supernatural terrors that haunt much more than just the hotel you’ve inherited.</p>
<p><iframe title="There are No Ghosts at the Grand Xbox Showcase Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-TaSv2hL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a lovely musical lilt to this as well, so story beats and cutscenes don’t just play out in raw emotion, but instead see characters breaking out into song, often with a bit of reggae, and with the ability to shape the story through choosing a verse for your protagonist to reply with. I can’t wait!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">Catch our preview of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand here</a>.</p>
<h2>43 –&nbsp;Directive 8020</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>Where Supermassive spun out the first series of The Dark Pictures anthology games in rapid succession, the wait for the new generation of the studio’s horror games is extending into 2026. Yet we’re still very keen to see how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> comes together.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Directive 8020 | Gamescom 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dmqh6m7vSBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in Supermassive’s series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship. The game is really pushing Supermassive’s breed of horror into action game territory, the sci-fi setting, the tight third person control and needing to stealthily sneak and evade the alien monster that’s hunting you.</p>
<h2>42 –&nbsp;Highguard</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 26th January 2026</em></p>
<p>There’s some mixed feelings out there about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/highguard">Highguard</a>, and I reckon that an awful lot of it is simply from the fact that a free-to-play mythic fantasy hero shooter was the game that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/free-to-play-pvp-shooter-highguard/">closed out The Game Awards</a> last month with its reveal. When you ideally want to save the best until last (especially for the time zone suffering incurred on anyone outside the Americas), this wasn’t it. But… when you mention that this is coming from some of the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall? Well, that should be pretty intriguing, so <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/13/why-are-gamers-hoping-highguard-will-be-dead-on-arrival/">why do people seem to want to see it fail</a>? Not us!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, what is Highguard? Well, they themselves describe it as “a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</p>
<h2>41 –&nbsp;Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, NSW, PC –&nbsp;5th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Square Enix know a thing or seventy-two about remastering their classics, and it feels like every remake and remaster takes a different approach to the visuals and gameplay changes. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Adventure Log Part 1 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtcnET6lQwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too. Absolutely one to watch for classic JRPG fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima Shares Emotional ‘Stranger Things’ Finale Message: ‘This Isn’t a Story About Saying Goodbye’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-stranger-things-finale-social/</link>
            <guid>1396417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima is a movie and television buff, which is something you’ll learn if you spend even a few minutes on his social media profiles. His games have always been deeply cinematic, and he takes a lot of inspiration from top-tier movies, indie productions, and everything in between.</p>



<p>Most recently, the legendary developer and visionary shared his emotional thoughts about the Stranger Things finale, which aired just a few days ago and shattered the hearts of millions worldwide, including Kojima.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-connected-with-stranger-things">Hideo Kojima Connected with Stranger Things</h2>



<p>This week, Stranger Things ended with a tumultuous final episode that ran for more than two hours. It was the culmination of ten years of storytelling, presenting viewers with some closure on a series that they’ve fallen in love with over the course of a lengthy, cacophonous decade.</p>



<p>It proved to be a divisive ending, splitting the community down the middle over the satisfaction of the thing and some of the storylines that have been left up to the viewer’s interpretation and beliefs. All in all, it was the end of a phenomenal journey that certainly had enough finality and emotion to hurl a heaping wave of catharsis over everyone involved.</p>



<p>That includes the gaming icon and veteran developer, Hideo Kojima.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2007305007948054597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>STRANGER THINGS has reached its finale. </p>



<p>For me, it was actually a very special drama series. It began in 2016, during my difficult time right after I went independent, a period filled with anxiety and loneliness. It was also when I first started watching streaming services as a new kind of medium. Over the past ten years, I’ve spent time with Eleven, the others, and the people of Hawkins (including the monsters from the Upside Down), receiving courage from them and being pushed forward again and again. </p>



<p>As I watched them grow through the story, I was also growing in the “real world,” the story’s own kind of Upside Down—struggling, tracing connections, and finding my way forward in much the same way. It’s sad to think that I won’t be seeing them anymore. But there’s always a way to return to this “town.” </p>



<p><strong>This isn’t a story about saying goodbye. </strong>As symbolized by D&amp;D (the table-talk RPG) at both the beginning and the end, the “story” already lives within us. By recalling that world and those characters, and “table-talking” it in our minds, we can create new stories at any time. </p>



<p>Among the many stories born inside us, they will continue to live on forever. There, they’ll meet again and keep adventuring. As long as we don’t forget, it’s always “here.” Thank you, STRANGER THINGS.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a heartfelt take from the creator who finds himself wearing his heart on his sleeve much more as he ages. Kojima is an entertainment aficionado and often shares takes on social media related to television shows, movies, music, and art, but this is one of the longest messages he’s posted in response to a recent release or production.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Major Co-Op Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you want to enjoy the casualness of a single-player game and inject a bit of the chaos, togetherness, and realness of an online multiplayer title, co-op is your best friend. 2026 is already shaping up to be another amazing year for co-op gaming, and this list has picked out the ones you need to wishlist and eventually install.</p>



<p>Nothing beats a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-for-family-this-holiday-season-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> done right. Enjoying the thrills and spills of an action game alongside someone else, or piercing your partner’s eardrum with a banshee-like screech, tackling a horror game in fear. It’s the best of both worlds, and the gaming space isn’t short of fun local and online cooperative journeys to undertake.</p>



<p>2026 is looking more stacked than a heavyweight prizefighter, and it’s no slouch where co-op games are concerned. Here are eight bona fide co-op contenders to keep an eye on.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2026">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from THQ Nordic</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tarsier Studios is doing what it does best in 2026 with its new IP—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reanimal-has-officially-gone-gold-two-months-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—focusing on co-op multiplayer in isolated and claustrophobic environments, leaving playable protagonists more vulnerable than a defrosted chicken fillet in the reaches of a cat. Expect to see many of the flourishes and fear-inducing traits that made Little Nightmares a hit, but with the introduction of less-linear sections.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Traveller’s Tales</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lovers of Arkham games or Batman in general need to have May 29, 2026, circled on the calendar. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> was an unbelievable experience at Gamescom 2025, and this could easily be in certain GOTY conversations come the end of the year. It deviates from traditional LEGO games and literally goes <strong>full Arkham City and Arkham Knight with an open-world Gotham</strong>, featuring Rocksteady’s trademark free-flowing combat system. Do you know the only thing better than all of this? It has two-player local co-op for crime-fighting dynamic duos.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: May 29</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even now, people are shocked that <strong>The Duskbloods is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong>. The power of the Switch 2 has opened significant doors for Nintendo, and FromSoftware has capitalized on this with The Duskbloods. Its gothic, dystopian world embroils the player in a dangerous PvPvE setup. If you feel lonely or have a tingle of trepidation heading into the demanding ARPG, you should be able to charge foolishly into combat with a teammate.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>343 Industries has confirmed that Halo: Campaign Evolved will go off the beaten path here and there in this fully-fledged remake of the 2001 classic. It brings to life a single-player adventure in a bygone era where campaigns were considered the lifeblood of the experience more, rather than the sad afterthought they’ve become in many shooters. The message has also been made very clear that there will be no online multiplayer, but co-op is definitely in!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon really is coming for everyone and everything, isn’t it? Card games, RPGs, casual photo-taking games, and The Pokémon Company have licensed most types of gaming experiences. One that hasn’t been done and makes complete sense is an Animal Crossing-style Pokémon game. What was that, you’re looking forward to it? Ditto. Oh, we’re not agreeing, it’s just that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> lets you be a Ditto adopting the form of a human, and it’s better not to ask questions. The main question is whether Pokémon Pokopia has co-op play, and the answer is an emphatic yes, with <strong>four-player co-op possible</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 5</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nioh might be the best Soulslike franchise not made by FromSoftware</strong>. There, it’s been said. Nioh and Nioh 2 honestly don’t get the love that they deserve. They’re ultra-clean and snappy, and the sequel evolves and keeps itself on an even keel with the outstanding first outing. Rise of the Ronin was a fun if uninspired effort to do something different, and Wo Long is also familiar, but Team Ninja’s Nioh world is unmatched. Team up with a co-op partner for Nioh 3’s upcoming barrage of mythological bosses, looking to end you, let you live, then end you again.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 6</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>

<p>We’ve only been privvy to one reveal trailer at present, but it goes without saying that Forza Horizon 6 is going to be mega—sorry, メガ! The sixth entry takes us to Japan, and while we’ve explored a lot of historical Japan in recent years with Sucker Punch’s ‘Ghost’ games, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and more, a modern-day racing game drifting around the sacred lands of Hokkaido&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tokyo should be sensational. If it has online co-op like FH5, it should hit top speed no problem.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>

<p>No doubt, 2026 will have the usual array of Steam indie games that take everything by storm. REPO was a great example of this with its manic multiplayer gameplay, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peak</a> was just as good and as fun. Developer Aggro Crab has already signalled its intention to support Peak, and the team is also working on Crashout Crew. As Steam says, you must: “Work together in online co-op with up to 4 players to fulfill orders of increasingly chaotic, physics-based boxes. Time is money, and safety is no concern… just try not to crash out!”</p>



<p>Let Insider Gaming know if any other big co-op games are missing from this list, and what you’re looking forward to the most.

            <guid>1396366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The DRM-free PC game store <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gog">GOG</a> has been acquired by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt</a> and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński, branching it off from the CD Projekt Group and going private.</p>
<p>There’s no plans to change GOG’s business model, which continues to focus on providing a source for classic games, now with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">a dedicated preservation programme</a> to ensure a select library continue to run on modern systems, and to sell all titles (old and new) without DRM.</p>


<p>While now independent of CD Projekt Group, they have immediately penned a deal to ensure that CDPR games remain on GOG going forward.</p>
<p>So, why the change? Was GOG in trouble? All parties say that no, it was doing well and is profitable on its own terms, but the CDPR want to focus fully on developing games.</p>
<p>“With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move,” said Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CD Projekt. “For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes.”</p>

<p>Kiciński was a co-founder of both CD Projekt in 1994, and then also their digital storefront Good Old Games (rebranded simply as GOG) in 2008. He left the company at the end of 2010, but has remained one of its largest shareholders, with 9.99%, and his brother is a chair on the board.</p>
<p>In the announcement, he said, “CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p>
<p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,” said Maciej Gołębiewski, Managing Director of GOG. “In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Biggest Fortnite Features Needed in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/7-biggest-fortnite-features-needed-in-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to get bigger and better with regular drops of new content, including major collabs, but there are still some major features missing from the Epic Games title which need to be introduced in 2026.</p>



<p>From updates that would improve a host of different modes, to additions that are major quality-of-life changes, Insider Gaming presents seven big features that Fortnite needs to introduce in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-features-needed-in-2026">Fortnite Features Needed in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-quest-mode">Quest Mode</h3>



<p>Every player has surely been in a situation where they land at a POI to complete a marked story quest, with the intention of solely interacting with an NPC, only to be attacked by a rival player and eliminated before they can tick off the task.</p>



<p>While that’s part and parcel of a Battle Royale mode, sometimes you just want to advance the story and see what’s cooking in the background narrative, but there’s currently no option to do that. Even when you land safely, it’s often a case of button-bashing to quickly advance dialogue before you are attacked.</p>



<p>Adding a quest mode with the removed risk of being attacked by rival players would be a major addition, even if it didn’t award XP for completing them, or even providing a recap in the main menu for players to experience what’s going on.</p>



<h3 id="h-customizable-hud">Customizable HUD</h3>



<p>It’s remarkable that Fortnite is so far into its lifespan without customizable options for the HUD, and that simply must change in 2026 to give players more ability to control their experience.</p>



<p>While this could be limited in ranked modes and tournaments to ensure a fair playing field, there’s no reason why players shouldn’t have the ability to adjust how things look on their HUD, and adding customization features would be a big move.</p>



<h3 id="h-destructible-terrain">Destructible Terrain</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s destruction mechanics are among the best in the business, with considerable improvements already being made in the recent The Simpsons mini-season with smashable windows without having to break down an entire wall, which remained for Chapter 7, but there’s still scope for more.</p>



<p>Currently, destroyed items are removed entirely, and no matter what you do to the landscape, it remains the same. Tweaks would make for a more interesting approach, with explosions, for example, leading to pits being made in the ground, and fallen trees remaining to hide behind.</p>



<h3 id="h-rideable-animals">Rideable Animals</h3>



<p>Fortnite has seen a wealth of travel mechanics added in the past, from vehicles to boats, planes to gliders, but more life should come to the Fortnite island, and rideable animals is a much-needed addition.</p>



<p>There’s easily scope for this to arrive in Chapter 7, which is themed on Hollywood and the west coast of the USA, with the introduction of horses a potential addition for a Wild West POI or environment fitting perfectly into the theme of the chapter.</p>



<p>We’ve seen limited-time rideable creatures and similar introduced to Fortnite in the past, but it’s time for permanent additions to be added.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-ally-controls">AI-Ally Controls</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Direct. Image via ShiinaBR</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recruiting an AI-NPC has long been a feature of Fortnite’s Battle Royale scene, with collab characters and others available on the map to provide support, but there are limitations with this and, more often than not, they can become a real hindrance and give away your position.</p>



<p>Adding AI controls to provide directions would be a huge boost, allowing players to direct the AI to open fire, move to a different position, or hide away. If this was added in 2026, it would improve the recruitable NPCs dramatically.</p>



<h3 id="h-bot-lobbies">Bot Lobbies</h3>



<p>Long rumored to be on the cards for Fortnite, but still yet to be seen, are bot lobbies, where players can enter a game filled entirely with AI opponents, if they’d rather not face off against other players online.</p>



<p>A bot lobby would be the perfect place for younger players to enjoy Battle Royale modes for the first time, and would provide all players with the opportunity to try out different weapons and approaches without the risk of seeing their plans thwarted by rival players.</p>



<p>Capping XP in the lobby would prevent it from being exploited for those just seeking to complete the Battle Pass swiftly, and there’s the scope for this mode already considering that bots are already widely present across multiple modes.</p>







<p>Fortnite is an extremely social game, and having a hub for players to hang out in would be a great addition for 2026, and we’ve already seen it used for multiple in-game events, so it’s way overdue for a permanent addition.</p>



<p>A social hub could provide direct access to a host of game modes, with the ability to squad-up with other players you encounter, and mini games could also be available to pass the time.</p>



<p>Having the social hub available in the lobby for players would also be a huge addition, particularly when you’re waiting for an AFK friend to return.</p>

<p>When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out <em>Civilization 7</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year’s list of Ars’ favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the “expected” side of this year’s list.</p>
<p>But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best G<em>eometry Wars</em> clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.</p>
<p>As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I wanted—and expected—virtually every game I played to blow me away with something I’d not seen before. It was easier to hit that bar in the ’90s, when both the design and technology of games were moving at an incredible pace.</p>
<p>Now, as someone who still games in his 40s, I’m excited to see that when it happens, but I don’t expect it, Now, I increasingly appreciate games that act as a sort of comfort food, and I value some games as much for their familiarity as I do their originality.</p>
<p>That’s what <i>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</i> is all about (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-dad-rock-of-video-games-and-i-love-it/">as I wrote</a> when it first came out). It follows a well-trodden formula, but it’s a beautifully polished version of that formula. Its world is grand and escapist, its audio and graphics presentation is immersive, and it makes room for many different playstyles and skill levels.</p>

<p>If your idea of a good time is “be a badass, but don’t think too hard about it,” <i>Shadows</i> is one of the best <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> titles in the franchise’s long history. It doesn’t reinvent any wheels, but after nearly two decades of <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, it doesn’t really need to; the new setting and story are enough to separate it, while the gameplay remains familiar.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed</em></h2>
<p><strong>Obsidian Entertainment; Windows, Xbox Series X|S</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/avowed.png">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>No game this year has made me feel as hated as <i>Avowed</i>. As an envoy for the far-off Aedryan empire, your role in <i>Avowed</i> is basically to be hated, either overtly or subtly, by almost everyone you encounter in the wild, semi-colonized world of the Living Lands. The low-level hum of hatred and mistrust from the citizens permeates everything you do in the game, which is an unsettling feeling in a genre usually characterized by the moral certitude of heroes fighting world-ending evil.</p>
<p>Role-playing aside, <i>Avowed</i> is helpfully carried by its strong action-packed combat system, characterized as it is by thrilling moment-to-moment positional jockeying and the juggling of magic spells, ranged weapons, and powerful close-range melee attacks. The game’s quest system also does a good job of letting players balance this combat difficulty for themselves—if a goal is listed with three skull symbols on your menu, you’d best put it off until you’ve leveled up a little bit more.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the mystical mumbo-jumbo-filled subplot surrounding your status as a “godlike” being that can converse with spirits. Aside from that, though, I’ve never had so much fun being hated.</p>

<h2><em>Baby Steps</em></h2>
<p><strong>Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, Bennett Foddy; Windows, PS5</strong></p>

</a> The term “walking simulator” often gets thrown around in some game criticism circles as a derisive term for a title that’s about nothing more than walking around and looking at stuff. While <em>Baby Steps</em> might technically fit into that “walking simulator” model, stereotyping it in that way does this incredibly inventive game a disservice.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>It starts with the walking itself, which requires meticulous, rhythmic manipulation of both shoulder buttons and both analog sticks just to stay upright. <i>Super Mario 64,</i> this ain’t. But what starts as a struggle to take just a few short steps quickly becomes almost habitual, much like learning to walk in real life.</p>
<p>The game then starts throwing new challenges at your feet. Slippery surfaces. Narrow stairways with tiny footholds. Overhangs that block your ridiculously useless, floppy upper body. The game’s relentless mountain is designed such that a single missed step can ruin huge chunks of progress, in the proud tradition of <i>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</i>.</p>
<p>This all might sound needlessly cruel and frustrating, but trust me, it’s worth sticking with to the end. That’s in part for the feeling of accomplishment when you do finally make it past that latest seemingly impossible wall, and partly to experience an absolutely gonzo story that deals directly and effectively with ideas of masculinity, perseverance, and society itself. You’ll never be so glad to take that final step.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit</em></h2>
<p><strong>Kenny Sun; Windows, MacOS, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Switch 2</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ballxpit.png">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>The idea of bouncing a ball against a block is one of the most tried-and-true in all of gaming, from the basic version in the ancient <i>Breakout</i> to the number-filled angles of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268370/holedown/"><i>Holedown</i></a>. But perhaps no game has made this basic concept as compulsively addictive as <i>Ball x Pit</i>.</p>
<p>Here, the brick-breaking genre is crossed with the almost as storied shoot-em-up, with the balls serving as your weapons and the blocks as enemies that march slowly but relentlessly from the top of the screen to the bottom. The key to destroying those blocks all in time is bouncing your growing arsenal of new balls at just the right angles to maximize their damage-dealing impact and catching them again so you can throw them once more that much faster.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like so many roguelikes before it, <i>Ball x Pit</i> uses randomization as the core of its compulsive loop, letting you choose from a wide selection of new abilities and ball-based attacks as you slowly level up. But <i>Ball x Pit </i>goes further than most in letting you fuse and combine those balls into unique combinations that take dozens of runs to fully uncover and combine effectively.</p>
<p>Add in a deep system of semi-permanent upgrades (with its own intriguing “bounce balls around a city builder” mini game) and a deep range of more difficult settings and enemies to slowly unlock, and you have a game whose addictive pull will last much longer than you might expect from the simple premise.</p>

<h2><em>Blue Prince</em></h2>
<p><strong>Dogubomb; Windows, MacOS, PS5, Xbox Series X|S</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bueprince.jpg">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>Usually, when formulating a list like this, you can compare a title to an existing game or genre as a shorthand to explain what’s going on to newcomers. That’s nearly impossible with <i>Blue Prince</i>, a game that combines a lot of concepts to defy easy comparison to games that have come before it.</p>
<p>At its core, <i>Blue Prince</i> is about solving the mysteries of a house that you build while exploring it, drafting the next room from a selection of three options every time you open a new door. Your initial goal, if you can call it that, is to discover and access the mysterious “Room 46” that apparently exists somewhere on the 45-room grid. And while the houseplan you’re building resets with every in-game day, the knowledge you gain from exploring those rooms stays with you, letting you make incremental progress on a wide variety of puzzles and mysteries as you rebuild the mansion from scratch again and again.</p>
<p>What starts as a few simple and relatively straightforward puzzles quickly unfolds fractally into a complex constellation of conundrums, revealed slowly through scraps of paper, in-game books, inventory items, interactive machinery, and incidental background elements. Figuring out the more intricate mysteries of the mansion requires careful observation and, often, filling a real-life mad scientist’s notepad with detailed notes that look incomprehensible to an outsider. All the while, you have to manage each day’s limited resources and luck-of-the-draw room drafting to simply find the right rooms to make the requisite progress.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Getting to that storied Room 46 is enough to roll the credits on <i>Blue Prince</i>, and it serves as an engaging enough puzzle adventure in its own right. But that whole process could be considered a mere tutorial for a simply massive endgame, which is full of riddles that will perplex even the most experienced puzzlers while slowly building a surprisingly deep story of political intrigue and spycraft through some masterful environmental storytelling.</p>
<p>Some of those extreme late-game puzzles might be too arcane for their own good, honestly, and will send many players scrambling for a convenient guide or wiki for some hints. But even after playing for over 100 hours over two playthroughs, I’m pretty sure I’m still not done exploring all that <i>Blue Prince</i> has to offer.</p>

<h2><em>Civilization VII</em></h2>
<p><strong>Firaxis; Windows, MacOS, Linux, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series X|S, Switch 2</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/civ7-2.jpg">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>This one will be controversial: I love <i>Civilization VII</i>.</p>
<p><i>Civilization VII</i> launched as a bit of a mess. There were bugs and UI shortcomings aplenty. Most (but not all) of those have been addressed in the months since, but they’re not the main reason this is a tricky pick.</p>
<p>The studio behind the Civilization franchise, Firaxis, has long said it has a “33/33/33″ approach to sequels in the series, wherein 33 percent of the game should be familiar systems, 33 percent should be remixes or improvements of familiar systems, and 33 percent should be entirely new systems.</p>
<p>Critics of <i>Civilization VII</i> say Firaxis broke that 33/33/33 rule by overweighting the last 33 percent, mainly to chase innovations in the 4X genre by other games (like <i>Humankind</i>). I don’t disagree, but I also welcome it.</p>
<p>Credit is due to the team at Firaxis for ingeniously solving some longstanding design problems in the franchise, like using the new age transitions to curb snowballing and to expunge systems that become a lot less fun in the late game than they are in the beginning. Judged on its own terms, <i>Civilization VII</i> is a deep, addictive, and fun strategy game that I’ve spent more than 100 hours playing this year.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>My favorite Civ game remains <i>Civilization IV</i>, but that game still runs fine on modern systems, is infinitely replayable out of the box, and enjoys robust modding support. I simply didn’t need more of the same from this particular franchise; to me, <i>VII</i> coexists with <i>IV</i> and others on my hard drive—very different flavors of the same idea.</p>

<h2><em>CloverPit</em></h2>
<p><strong>Panik Arcade; Windows, Xbox Series X|S</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cloverpit.jpg">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>I’m not sure I like what my minor <i>CloverPit</i> obsession says about me. When I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-technicas-top-20-video-games-of-2024/">fell into a deep <i>Balatro</i> hole last year</a>, I could at least delude myself into thinking there was some level of skill in deciding which jokers to buy and sell, which cards to add or prune from my deck, and which cards to hold and discard. In the end, though, I was as beholden to the gods of random number generation as any other <i>Balatro</i> player.</p>
<p><i>Cloverpit</i> makes the surrender to the vagaries of luck all the more apparent, replacing the video-poker-like systems of Balatro with a “dumb” slot machine whose handle you’re forced to pull over and over again. Sure, there are still decisions to make, mostly regarding which lucky charms you purchase from a vending machine on the other side of the room. And there is some skill involved in learning and exploiting lucky charm synergies to extract the highest expected value from those slot machine pulls.</p>
<p>Once you’ve figured out those basic strategies, though, <i>CloverPit</i> mostly devolves into a series of rerolls waiting for the right items to show up in the shop in the right order. Thankfully, the game hides plenty of arcane secrets beneath its charming PS1-style spooky-horror presentation, slowly revealing new items and abilities that hint that something deeper than just accumulating money might be the game’s true end goal.</p>
<p>It’s this creepy vibe and these slowly unfolding secrets that have compelled me to pour dozens of hours into what is, in the end, just a fancy slot machine simulator. God help me.</p>

<h2><em>Consume Me</em></h2>
<p><strong>Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson; Windows, MacOS</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/consumeme.jpg">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>Jenny is your average suburban Asian-American teenager, struggling to balance academic achievement, chores, an overbearing mother, romantic entanglements, and a healthy body image. What sounds like the premise for a cliché young adult novel actually serves to set up a compelling interactive narrative disguised as a mere mini-game collection.</p>
<p><i>Consume Me</i> brilliantly integrates the conflicting demands placed on Jenny’s time and attention into the gameplay itself. Creating a balanced meal, for instance, becomes a literal test of balancing vaguely <em>Tetris</em>-shaped pieces of food on a tray, satisfying your hunger and caloric limits at the same time. Chores take up time but give you money you can spend on energy drinks that let you squeeze in more activities by staying up late (but can lead to debilitating headaches). A closet full of outfits becomes an array of power-ups to your time, energy, or focus.</p>
<p>It takes almost preternatural resource management skills and mini-game execution to satisfy all the expectations being placed on you, which is kind of the meta-narrative point. No matter how well you do, Jenny’s story develops in a way that serves as a touching semi-autobiographical look at the life of co-creator Jenny Jiao Hsia. That biography is made all the more sympathetic here for an interactive presentation that’s more engaging than any young adult novel could be.</p>

<h2><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></h2>
<p><strong>Kojima Productions; PS5</strong></p>

      </a></figure>
<p><i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i> should not be fun. Much like its predecessor, the latest release from famed game designer Hideo Kojima is about delivering packages—at least on the surface. Yet the process of planning your routes, managing inventory, and exploring an unfathomably strange post-apocalyptic world remains a winning formula.</p>
<p>The game again follows Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) on his quest to reconnect the world as humanity faces possible extinction. And yes, that means acting like a post-apocalyptic Amazon Prime. Standing in the way of an on-time delivery are violent raiders, dangerous terrain, and angry, disembodied spirits known as Beached Things.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It’s common to hear <i>Death Stranding</i> described as a walking simulator, and there is indeed a lot of walking, but the sequel introduces numerous quality-of-life improvements that make it more approachable. <i>Death Stranding 2</i> has a robust fast-travel mechanic and better vehicles to save you from unnecessary marches, and the inventory management system is less clunky. That’s important in a game that asks you to traverse an entire continent to deliver cargo.</p>
<p>Beyond the core gameplay loop of stacking heavy boxes on your back, <i>Death Stranding 2</i> has all the Kojima vibes you could want. There are plenty of quirky gameplay mechanics and long cutscenes that add depth to the characters and keep the story moving. The world of <i>Death Stranding</i> has been designed from the ground up around the designer’s flights of fancy, and it works—even the really weird stuff almost makes sense!</p>
<p>Along the way, <i>Death Stranding 2</i> has a lot to say about grief, healing, and the value of human connection. The game’s most poignant cutscenes are made all the more memorable by an incredible soundtrack, and we cannot oversell the strength of the mocap performances.</p>
<p>It may take 100 hours or more to experience everything the game has to offer, but it’s well worth your time.</p>

<p>Since the days of <i>Donkey Kong Country</i>, I’ve always felt that Mario’s original ape antagonist wasn’t really up for anchoring a Mario-level platform franchise. <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> is the first game to really make me doubt that take.</p>
<p><i>Bonanza </i>is a great showcase for the new, more powerful hardware on the Switch 2, with endlessly destructible environments that send some impressive-looking shiny shrapnel flying when they’re torn apart. It can’t be understated how cathartic it is to pound tunnels up, down, and through pretty much every floor, ceiling, and wall you see, mashing the world itself to suit your needs.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><i>Bonanza</i> also does a good job aping <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>’s tendency to fill practically every square inch of space with collectible doodads and a wide variety of challenges. This is not a game where you need to&nbsp;spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering for the next thing to do—there’s pretty much always something interesting around the next corner until the extreme end game.</p>
<p>Sure, the camera angles and frame rate might suffer a bit during the more chaotic bits. But it’s hard to care when you’re having this much fun just punching your way through <i>Bananza</i>’s imaginative, colorful, and malleable world.</p>

<p>For a series that has always been about dodging, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> is much more about standing your ground. The game’s key verbs involve raising your shield to block incoming attacks or, ideally, parrying them back in the direction they came.</p>
<p>It’s a real “zig instead of zag” moment for the storied <i>Doom</i> series, and it does take some getting used to. Overall, though, I had a great time mixing in turtle-style blocking with the habitual pattern of circling-strafing around huge groups of enemies in massive arenas and quickly switching between multiple weapons to deal with them as efficiently as possible. While I missed the focus on extreme verticality of the last two <i>Doom</i> games, I appreciate the new game’s more open-world design, which gives completionist players a good excuse to explore every square inch of these massive environments for extra challenges and hidden collectibles.</p>
<p>The only real problem with <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> comes when the game occasionally transitions to a slow-paced mech-style demon battle or awkward flying dragon section, sometimes for entire levels at a time. Those variations aside, I came away very satisfied with the minor change in focus for a storied shooter series.</p>

<p>Anyone who has read <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">my book-length treatise on <i>Minesweeper</i></a> knows I’m a sucker for games that involve hidden threats within a grid of revealed numbers. But not all variations on this theme are created equal. <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper"><i>Dragonsweeper</i></a> stands out from the crowd by incorporating a simple but arcane world of RPG-style enemies and items into its logical puzzles.</p>
<p>Instead of simply counting the number of nearby mines, each number revealed on the Dragonsweeper grid reflects the total health of the surrounding enemies, both seen and unseen. Attacking those enemies means enduring predictable counterattacks that deplete your limited health bar, which you can grow through gradual leveling until you’re strong enough to kill the game’s titular dragon, taunting you from the center of the field.</p>
<p>Altogether, it adds an intriguing new layer to the logical deduction, forcing you to carefully manage your moves to maximize the impact of your attacks and the limited health-restoring items scattered throughout the field. And while finishing one run isn’t too much of a challenge, completing the game’s optional achievements and putting together a “perfect” game score is enough to keep puzzle lovers coming back for hours and hours of compelling logical deduction.</p>

<p>At first blush, <em>Nightreign</em> feels like a twisted perversion of everything that has made FromSoft’s Souls series so compelling for so many years. What was a slow-paced, deliberate open-world RPG has become a game about quickly sprinting across a quickly contracting map, leveling up as quickly as possible before taking on punishing bosses. A moody solitary experience has become one that practically requires a group of three players working together. It’s like an <em>Elden Ring</em>-themed amusement park that seems to miss the point of the original.</p>
<p>Whatever. It still works!</p>
<p>Let the purists belly ache about how it’s not really <i>Elden Ring.</i> They’re right, but they’re missing the point. <i>Nightreign</i> condenses the general vibe of the <em>Elden Ring</em> world into something very different but no less enjoyable. What’s more, it packs that vibe into a tight experience that can be easily squeezed into a 45-minute sprint rather than requiring dozens of hours of deep exploration.</p>

<p>That makes it the perfect excuse to get together with a few like-minded <i>Elden Ring</i>-loving friends, throw on a headset, and just tear through the Lands Between together for the better part of an evening. As <i>Elden Ring</i> theme parks go, you could do a lot worse.</p>

<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2>
<p><strong>Sucker Punch Productions; PS5</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yotei.jpg">
    
      </a></figure>
<p><i>Ghost of Yotei</i> from Sucker Punch Productions starts as a revenge tale, featuring hard-as-nails Atsu on the hunt for the outlaws who murdered her family. While there is plenty of revenge to be had in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, the people Atsu meets and the stories they have to tell make this more than a two-dimensional quest for blood.</p>
<p>The game takes place on the northern Japanese island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido) several centuries after the developer’s last samurai game, <i>Ghost of Tsushima</i>. It has a lot in common with that title, but <i>Ghost of Yotei</i> was built for the PS5 and features a massive explorable world and stunning visuals. It’s easy to get sidetracked from your quest just exploring Ezo and tinkering with the game’s photo mode.</p>
<p>The land of Ezo avoids some of the missteps seen in other open-world games. While it’s expansive and rich with points of interest, exploring it is not tedious. There are no vacuous fetch quests or mindless collecting (or loading screens, for that matter). Even when you think you know what you’re going to find at a location, you may be surprised. The interesting side quests and random encounters compel you to keep exploring Ezo.</p>
<p><i>Ghost of Yotei’s </i>combat is just as razor-sharp as its exploration. It features multiple weapon types, each with unlockable abilities and affinities that make them ideal for taking on certain foes. Brute force will only get you so far, though. You need quick reactions to parry enemy attacks and strike back—it’s challenging and rewarding but not frustrating.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>It’s impossible to play <i>Ghost of Yotei</i> without becoming invested in the journey, and a big part of that is thanks to the phenomenal voice work of Erika Ishii as Atsu. Some of the game’s pivotal moments will haunt you, but luckily, the developer has just added a New Game+ mode so you can relive them all again.</p>

<h2><em>Hades 2</em></h2>
<p><strong>Supergiant Games; Windows, MacOS, Switch, Switch 2</strong></p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hades-sirens.png">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>There’s a moment in the second section of <i>Hades 2</i> where you start to hear a haunting melody floating through the background. That music gets louder and louder until you reach the game’s second major boss, a trio of sirens that go through a full rock-opera showtune number as you dodge their bullet-hell attacks and look for openings to go in for the kill. That three-part musical presentation slowly dwindles to a solo as you finally dispatch the sirens one by one, restoring a surprisingly melancholy silence once more.</p>
<p>It’s this and other musical moments casually and effortlessly woven through <i>Hades 2</i> that will stick with me the most. But the game stands on its own beyond the musicality, expanding the original game’s roguelike action with a compelling new spell system that lets you briefly capture or slow enemies in a binding circle. This small addition adds a new sense of depth to the moment-to-moment positional dance that was already so compelling in the original <i>Hades</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hades 2</i> also benefits greatly from the introduction of Melinoe, a compelling new protagonist who gets fleshed out through her relationship with the usual rogue’s gallery of gods and demigods. Come for her quest of self-discovery, stay for the moments of musical surprise.</p>

<p>A quickie sequel in the year or two after <i>Hollow Knight’s </i>out-of-nowhere success in 2017 might have been able to get away with just being a more-of-the-same glorified expansion pack. But after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/">over eight years of overwhelming anticipation</a> from fans, <i>Silksong</i> had to really be something special to live up to its promise.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Luckily, it is. <i>Silksong </i>is a beautiful expansion of the bug-scale underground universe created in the first game. Every new room is a work of painterly beauty, with multiple layers of detailed 2D art drawing you further into its intricate and convincing fallen world.</p>
<p>The sprawling map seems to extend forever in every direction, circling back around and in on itself with plenty of optional alleyways in which to get lost searching for rare power-ups. And while the game is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-hard-well-it-depends-on-what-you-mean-by-hard/">punishingly hard</a> take on action platforming, there’s usually a way around the most difficult reflex tests for players willing to explore and think a bit outside the box.</p>
<p>Even players who hit a wall and never make it through the sprawling tunnels of <i>Silksong</i>’s labyrinthine underground will still find plenty of memorable moments in whatever portion of the game they do experience.</p>

<p>In a real-time-strategy genre that can often feel too bloated and complex for its own good, <i>The King Is Watching</i> is a streamlined breath of fresh air. Since the entire game takes place on a single screen, there’s no need to constantly pan and zoom your camera around a sprawling map. Instead, you can stay laser-focused on your 5×5 grid of production space and on which portion of it is actively productive under the king’s limited gaze at any particular moment.</p>
<p>Arranging tiles to maximize that production of basic resources and military units quickly becomes an all-consuming juggling act, requiring constant moment-to-moment decisions that can quickly cascade through a run. I’m also a big fan of the game’s self-selecting difficulty system, which asks you to choose how many enemies you think you can take in coming waves, doling out better rewards for players who are willing to push themselves to the limit of their current capabilities.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>The bite-size serving of a single <i>King Is Watching </i>run ensures that even failure doesn’t feel too crushing. And success brings with it just enough in the way of semi-permanent ability expansions to encourage another run where you can reach even greater heights of production and protection.</p>

<p><i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</i> was a slog that I had to will myself to complete. It was sometimes a broken and janky game, but despite its warts, I saw the potential for something special. And that’s what its sequel, <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</i> has delivered.</p>
<p>While it’s still a slow burn, the overall experience has been greatly refined, the initial challenge has been smoothed out, and I’ve rarely been more immersed in an RPG’s storytelling. There’s no filler, as every story beat and side quest offers a memorable tale that further paints the setting and characters of medieval Bohemia.</p>
<p>Unlike most RPGs, there’s no magic to be had, which is a big part of the game’s charm. As Henry of Skalitz, you are of meager social standing, and many characters you speak to will be quick to remind you of it. While Henry is a bit better off than his humble beginnings in the first game, you’re no demigod that can win a large battle single-handedly. In fact, you’ll probably lose fairly often in the early goings if more than one person is attacking you.</p>
<p>Almost every fight is a slow dance once you’re in a full suit of armor, and your patience and timing will be the key to winning over the stats of your equipment. But therein lies the beauty of <i>KC:D II:</i> Every battle you pick, whether physical or verbal, carries some weight to your experience and shapes Bohemia for better or worse.</p>

</a>After the incredible success of <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>and its various downloadable content packs on the Switch, Nintendo could have easily done a prettier “more of the same” sequel as the launch-window showcase for the Switch 2. Instead, the company took a huge gamble in trying to transform Mario Kart’s usual distinct tracks into a vast, interconnected open world.</p>
<p>This conceit works best in “Free Roam” mode, where you can explore the outskirts of the standard tracks and the wide open spaces in between for hundreds of mini-challenges that test your driving speed and precision. Add in dozens of collectible medallions and outfits hidden in hard-to-reach corners, and the mode serves as a great excuse to explore every nook and cranny of a surprisingly detailed and fleshed-out world map.</p>
<p>I was also a big fan of Knockout Mode, which slowly whittles a frankly overwhelming field of 24 initial racers to a single winner through a series of endurance rally race checkpoints. These help make up for a series of perplexing changes that hamper the tried-and-true Battle Mode formula and long straightaway sections that feel more than a little bit stifling in the standard Grand Prix mode. Still, Free Roam mode had me happily whiling away dozens of hours with my new Switch 2 this year.</p>

<p>For decades now, I’ve been looking for a twin-stick shooter that fully captures the compulsive thrill of the <i>Geometry Wars</i> franchise. <i>Sektori</i>, a late-breaking addition to this year’s top games list, is the first game I can say does so without qualification.</p>
<p>Like <i>Geometry Wars</i>, <i>Sektori</i> has you weaving through a field filled with simple shapes that quickly fill your personal space with ruthless efficiency. But <i>Sektori</i> advances that basic premise with an elegant “strike” system that lets you dash through encroaching enemies and away from danger with the tap of a shoulder button. Advanced players can get a free, instant strike refill by dashing into an upgrade token, and stringing those strikes together creates an excellent risk-vs-reward system of survival versus scoring.</p>
<p><i>Sektori </i>also features an excellent <i>Gradius</i>-style upgrade system that forces you to decide on the fly whether to take basic power-ups or save up tokens for more powerful weaponry and/or protection further down the line. And just when the basic gameplay threatens to start feeling stale, the game throws in a wide variety of bosses and new modes that mix things up just enough to keep you twitching away.</p>
<p>Throw in an amazing soundtrack and polished presentation that makes even the most crowded screens instantly comprehensible, and you have a game I can see myself coming back to for years—until my reflexes are just too shot to keep up with the frenetic pace anymore.</p>

          <p>Vince Zampella, a video game developer who has co-created or helmed some of the most popular franchises in the world, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles highway at 12:45 pm Pacific time on Sunday, December 21. He was 55 years old.</p>
<p>According to the California Highway Patrol, Zampella was in a car on Angeles Crest Highway when the vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a concrete barrier. No other vehicles were reported to be part of the crash.</p>
<p>A passenger was ejected from the vehicle, while the driver was trapped inside after the vehicle caught fire. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger died after being taken to the hospital. The report did not indicate whether Zampella was the passenger or the driver.</p>
<p>Angeles Crest Highway is a scenic road under the San Gabriel Mountains on the eastern end of LA and is commonly used for Sunday leisure drives. The vehicle involved in the crash was a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS.</p>
<h2>A storied career in game development</h2>
<p>Early in his career, Zampella worked at SegaSoft and Panasonic, and he was the lead designer for the influential World War II shooter <em>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</em>, which was released in 2002. But it was the famed studio Infinity Ward that turned him into a household name for gamers. He co-founded Infinity Ward with Jason West and Grant Collier in 2002.</p>

<p>I'll be putting at least one of those to use this weekend (spoiler: it's not the turkey), and then maybe finally get around to checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> if I manage to polish things off.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Started the year taking care of something that has been nagging me for years.</p>
<p><strong>Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</strong> was the one single entry in the whole franchise that I never owned because it remains an Xbox 360 exclusive. In those days I was a happy Wii owner and had no way to afford a RRoD incubator, but by the end of this weekend Gracemeria will be free again. I now understand why this entry is so revered within the Ace Combat community; no way a game could look and play this good in back in 2007.</p>
<p>On Switch 2 I am back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> since I managed to clear (almost) all my backlog on the system during the holidays.</p>
<p>First game of the year goes to <strong>Tape to Tape</strong>. This is the Steam-only, early access spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/nhl_hitz_pro">NHL Hitz</a> with more than a hint of <strong>Shoresy</strong> for good measure. Winter is the perfect time for some action on the ice and that is exactly what I’m getting. Onwards to 2026!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Having worked most days beyond the 'big ones' this year — and with large amounts of Lego and food prep taking up my off days — I've barely managed to touch my Switch over Christmas. So, I've still got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, and I still need to get on the eShop and get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2D</a> downloaded. Listening to the <a href="https://www.myperfectconsole.com/">My Perfect Console</a> GOTY podcast reminded me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/expelled">Expelled</a>, too. Gotta make use of this brief January lull!</p>
<p>Speaking of the eShop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Batman Arkham Trilogy</a> for 20€ is tempting me. By all accounts, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Arkham Knight</a> is now in a playable state on Switch 2, it's the only one of the three I never got to, and owning <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_asylum">Asylum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_city">City</a> on Switch would be nice, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> icon is still sitting there on my Home screen, poking and prodding me. <em>C´mon, now's the time.</em></p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I actually haven’t been spending much time on the Switch over Christmas and New Year; not as much as I’d like, at least. I’ve been glued to the PS5 playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill F</a>, and my goodness, it’s incredible! The environmental design, the atmosphere, the monsters… It’s peak Silent Hill, and I’m keen to really take my time with it and soak it all in.</p>
<p>I also bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a> while it’s on sale, and it’s proving to be a delightful little blast from the past so far. It’s clearly been improved drastically since its initial release, with some lovely classic lighting and ray-tracing, and the combat controls are generally much more approachable than they used to be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grandfather Nurgle, the Chaos god of plagues, disease, rot, and rebirth, gets a new Battletome for <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition, along with a whole host of new units to share Nurgle's gifts with the realms. In this article, we take a look at some of the brand new units and a new Regiment of Renown.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Age of Sigmar</em> for a while, and you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Skaventide</a>, the launch box for <em>AoS</em> 4th edition, along with our guide to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Spearhead</a> <em>AoS</em> gameplay format. We also recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Darkwater</a>, which features several of the new units in the new battletome.</p>
<p>The Maggotkin of Nurgle all serve the Chaos god Nurgle, the god of disease, decay, despair, destruction, death, and rebirth. Their units usually appear covered in rot and decay, but also show signs of rebirth, and have new things growing out of them. This decay and rebirth, as part of the circle of life, make the Maggotkin extremely durable with high health and extra saves, but at the cost of mobility, as they plod slowly forward, relying on their resilience to get them into the fight, rather than speed.</p><p>The Maggotkin's new Battletome includes background for the Plaguefather's forces, warscrolls for returning and new units, a brand new Spearhead force, Path to Glory rules for creating your own hero, 2 armies of renown, and 2 regiments of renown (and we discuss one of them, The Pustules below).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Festus The Leechlord</h2><p>Festus the Leechlord is a new daemon prince for the Maggotkin. This former healer fell into Nurlge's clutches because he was obsessed with research, which led the Chaos god himself to train Festus. He rides a massive slug, Gathoblyt, into battle, which also keeps his workshop within reach so that he can create new poisons to use against his foes.</p><p>Festus can cast The Leechlord's Curse on an enemy, which has a chance to deal mortal wounds and heal Festus for each wound dealt, every time that unit uses a core ability or command. He can also poison units he is in combat with, dealing wounds to heroes and monsters, or simply slaying a model in a unit outright on a command roll off, and if any units in combat with Festus are slain, he gains D3 Leech points, which boost his command stat by the number he has.</p><p>Festus' model isn't particularly imposing, not when compared to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-review-infernal-reinforcements" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Urak Taar</a>, but it is a solid miniature, full of thematic detail that captures the mobile tainted apothecary.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Rotswords</h2><p>The Rotswords suffer from a constant fever, leaving them constantly sweating and hot to the touch. This gives them a sweat-soaked and reeking ability, which stops units that have charged and are in combat with them from using commands on a 3+. The Rotswords come armed with Ruined Master Crafted weapons that have 2 attacks and deal 2 hits on a crit.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The Maggotkin of Nurgle Rotswords Musician is my favorite miniature of the wave of releases. Those overlapping bells would make an insane noise.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Rotwords come boxed in a unit of 10 models with 3 sprues of unique builds, with interchangeable shields, weapons, and heads. There are also options for a Champion, Standard Bearer, and Musician (the Musician is my favourite sculpt of this entire release wave).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Sloven Knights</h2><p>The Sloven Knights were once regal mounted knights, but now fallen to Chaos they are a shadow of their former selves. Still mounted on their now corrupted steeds, they have 2 attacks dealing 3 damage on the charge, and their Pall of Exhaustion ability can give a unit they're in combat with Strike Last on a 3+.</p><p>The Sloven Knights come in a box of 3 fixed builds with different head options. The Knights' sculpts look like absolute units atop their rotten steeds.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Putrid Blightkings</h2><p>The bloated Putrid Blightkings are some of the most devoted of Nurgle. They're extremely effective against wizards and priests, with their Discomforting Stench ability, which can make it more difficult for a targeting wizard or priest to use their spells and blessings by rolling over their power level. They're also armed with Pox-blighed weapons with 4 attacks, and rend 2 against priests and wizards.</p><p>The Putrid Blightkings come in a box of 5, with mainly fixed builds except for the 2 head options for the Champion, and the option to build a Standard Bearer, or normal Blightking.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-maggotkin-of-nurgle-releases-7.jpg?itok=5Qmden0j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>The Pustules</h2><p>The Pustules are a Maggotkin Regiment of Renown, and the box comes with 10 Plaguebearers, a Spoilpox Scrivener, and a Feculent Gnarlmaw. The Spoilpox Scrivener is also available separately in this wave of releases, having only been available in the Spearhead box before. This Regiment of Renown can be included in forces from the other 3 Chaos gods (Blades of Khorne, Disciples of Tzeentch, Headonites of Slaneesh), or in Slaves to Darkness, Skaven, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashut</a> armies.</p><p>Normally, Nurgle's Plaguebearers are more difficult for enemies to hit while they're contesting an objective, and the Spoilpox Scrivener can boost their Control Score to help win that objective. The Gnarlmaw is a terrain feature that deploys at the start of the battle, and can heal the Plaguebearers if they are within 12 inches of it, and can return slain models if they are contesting an objective for some overlapping synergies to make sure your Plaguebearers dominate the objective their sitting on.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>From The Depths Of Darkwater</h2><p>Several units from the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Darkwater</a> are getting separate releases and appear in the new Maggotkin of Nurgle Battletome. The only ones that don't make an appearance are Mulgoth the Cleaver and the Blight Templars, with the following releases in boxes we detail below.</p><ul><li>Court of Gelgus Pust - Gelgus comes in a box along with Belga the Cystwitch and Shaman Foulhoof. Gelgus comes armed with Malady and Contagion, which have 7 attacks with 3 damage each, and once per game, he can pollute a terrain feature that boosts the healing of nearby friendly units and reduces the healing of nearby enemy units. Belga can deal mortal wounds to diseased enemy units within 18 inches, and enemies removed by that ability can return slain Plaguebearers to the battlefield. Foulhoof can boost the attacks of nearby Pestigor units, which also get a release in this wave.</li><li>Pestigors - Pestigors are the beastmen of Nurgle, and come in boxes of 10. They are just as durable as their Nurgle brethren, with an additional save. They each have 2 attacks and gain Rend 1 within their own territory. Foulhood can boost those attacks to 3 to make them very capable.</li><li>Cankerborn - The Cankerborn come in a box of 2, and you get 2 objective miniatures, which are used to mark objectives or terrain at the end of any turn with Pesilent Pollutants. The Cankerborn can use the Pollutants to teleport around the battlefield in their movement phase. They each have 4 attacks dealing 3 damage and dealing mortal wounds on crits.</li><li>Pox-Wretches - Pox-Wretches come in a box of 14, with 6 Mire Kelpie tokens, which the Pox-Wretches can remove to try and give a unit they're in combat with the Diseased keyword. The Diseased keyword plays into the Maggotkin of Nurgles' faction abilities, like the Blessed by the Plaguefather ability, which deals 1 mortal wound to all enemy units if all enemies have the Diseased keyword.</li></ul><h2>Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle Units Final Thoughts?</h2><p>I've always been a fan of the Plaguefather's forces. I love the detail that the 2 ranges miniatures have (<em>AoS</em> and <em>40K</em>), and these new sculpts are no different. I've always been respectful of their resilience, having come across them many times playing <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. It also pleases me that the releases come hot off the back of the release of <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> and that the units are available so soon after, rather than being locked behind a separate game.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Maggotkin of Nurgle units have a lot of synergies on the battlefield, through the common goal of spreading disease to empower other abilities, and through local abilities like Foulhoof boosting the Pestigors. The Pustules regiment of renown is a lot of fun, and making the Plaguebearers even more resilient than normal is very satisfying. The whole wave of new release miniatures is full of fantastic detail, but the Sloven Knights and the Rotswords musician are my favourites.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>The Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle releases&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>FYQD</strong>, the one-man studio led by <strong>Zeng Xiancheng</strong> and known for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bright-memory-infinite-interview-zeng-on-raytracing-next-gen-and-december-target-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bright Memory Infinite</a></strong>, has announced a new game. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/FYQD_Studio/status/2006553505306489063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on X</a>, he said the currently untitled project is a third-person action shooter game set during the historical period of the <strong>Republic of China</strong>, 'amidst a time of turmoil and collapsing order, rival gangs clash in the shadows, as violence and conspiracy quietly spread through the streets.'</p>



<p>The Republic of China was formally established at the beginning of <strong>1912</strong>, following the <strong>Xinhai Revolution</strong> that ended <strong>over two thousand years of imperial history</strong>. It lasted until <strong>1949</strong>, when the Kuomintang-led government was ultimately defeated in the <strong>Chinese Civil War</strong> and forced to retreat to <strong>Taiwan</strong>, while the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong> assumed control of the mainland and founded the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>.</p>



<p>It is certainly a unique setting for a videogame. Most titles set in China are based on much earlier eras, such as the <strong>Three Kingdoms (AD 220–280)</strong> (by far <a href="https://wccftech.com/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-to-launch-on-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most used setting in games</a>), the <strong>Tang Dynasty (618–907)</strong>, and the <strong>Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)</strong>. Indeed, when FYQD shared the news on the Chinese social network <strong>Bilibili</strong>, a user advised him 'not to touch' the subject matter, as 'getting involved with real history is never a good thing'. The Bright Memory Infinite developer replied:</p>



<p><em>The story and all aspects of this work are fictional and have no connection or association with actual historical events. It merely uses the Republican era as a background setting. The focus of the game is on third-person action shooting.</em></p>



<p>Depending on the story's depiction, it could indeed attract scrutiny from the Chinese government. However, FYQD is undoubtedly aware of that, and it does not sound like he's planning to make the game controversial.</p>

<p>The developer also posted a few gorgeous in-game screenshots of the game on social media. That's not much of a surprise, though, as his graphical skills were already shown in Bright Memory Infinite. Be prepared for a long wait, though: this seems to be a way more complex project.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio's previous game is now <strong>50% off on Steam</strong> and <strong>30% off on the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo stores</strong>. Over 90% of the global Steam user reviews are positive, and sales estimates based on SteamDB project a range between 1.18 million units and 2.32 million units sold on Valve's platform.</p>

<p>Lee Sang-hyeok, more commonly known as ‘Faker’, has received the highest possible merit that athletes can achieve in South Korea. He was recently awarded the Cheongnyong Medal of the Order of Sport Merit, bestowed upon him by the nation’s president, Lee Jae-myung.</p>



<p>This medal recognizes Faker’s decade of contributions to the esports industry, maintaining a name as the most dominant League of Legends player ever to emerge. He’s the first esports competitor in history to secure a spot in the prestigious line-up of medal recipients.</p>







<h2 id="h-faker-recognized-in-new-year-s-ceremony">Faker Recognized in New Year’s Ceremony</h2>



<p>Faker was invited to the State Guest House in Cheong Wa Dae to receive his Cheongnyong Medal, recognizing his dedication and evolution in the esports industry over the last ten years.</p>



<p>For just over a decade, Faker has been dominating the League of Legends space, and has secured more world titles than any ofther competitor in the business. He has secured records in the domestic space in South Korea and has become synonymous with the ongoing success of the esports industry.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed Faker ‘the GOAT’ of esports.</p>



<p>Speaking after the medal ceremony, Faker said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an enormous personal honor to receive a decoration that represents the Republic of Korea. But I could not be standing here without the teammates and colleagues who have run alongside me up to this point.</p>



<p>This would have been impossible without the support of the fans who are always there giving me strength. I will continue to devote myself with my best effort in every moment, both in and out of competition, so that I can share positive messages and help raise the stature of Korean esports.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Showed No Interest in Fallout 4’s Most Impressive Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/</link>
            <guid>1396324</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July 2024, Fallout: London was released after years of development. The game-sized mod represented one of the most ambitious and long-awaited conversion projects in the history of the Fallout franchise, and it was very well received by fans worldwide. Owing to the size and stature of Fallout: London, it garnered quite a cult following over the years.</p>



<p>However, one of the people who perhaps <strong>should </strong>have been interested in it but <strong>wasn’t </strong>was Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard. In a recent interview, Howard revealed that he hasn’t played and never really followed Fallout: London, arguably the biggest Fallout 4 mod ever created and a transformative, mighty project.</p>







<h2 id="h-todd-howard-plays-it-safe-with-fallout-london">Todd Howard Plays it Safe with Fallout: London</h2>



<p>The driving theory behind Todd Howard’s apparent disinterest in Fallout: London is that he was hampered from praising the project by legal conditions. It’s no big secret that mods walk a grey area when it comes to legitimacy and IP infringement, but they’re part and parcel of the Bethesda landscape regardless.</p>



<p>If Todd Howard started gushing over Fallout: London, he’d have netizens taking to social media the world over to declare the mod canon, or something.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1q03rsp/todd_howard_on_fallout_london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a> hosted to celebrate the launch of Fallout’s second season, Todd Howard was asked about his interest in the Fallout: London mod, but the recognizable developer played coy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Only some videos that I’ve seen online; I have not played it.</p>



<p>Only a little bit. I would say we look at a lot of the modding that’s going on, and when you have those total conversions – I just want to say how <em>hard </em>that is.</p>



<p>And so, the fact that it came out, first of all, because most of those never come out, and the fact that it came out… It seems a lot of fans love it.</p>



<p>It’s just – I need to express to everybody out there how difficult and what a journey that is for some of these big mod teams to do stuff like that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also doesn’t help that he’s probably so busy he’s lucky ever to scrape a few hours playing <strong>any </strong>Fallout game, modded or otherwise.</p>



<p>Fallout: London represents what’s possible when a team of dozens pours resources, time, money, and effort into creating a passion project and turning it into something tangible and wholly accepted by a community. It’s one of the single-biggest mods in the gaming space, and it takes Fallout 4 and manipulates it into something otherworldly.</p>



<p>Team FOLON, the folks behind the mod, did such a good job that one or two of them were ultimately <strong>hired </strong>by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>When it launched, it was hosted on GOG and was downloaded a whopping 500,000 times in 24 hours, and in 2025, a <strong>VR version </strong>of the mod surfaced. If that wasn’t enough, more than a year after release, an expansion called Rabbit and Pork dropped, fuelling more interest in the mod.</p>

Keep in mind, there has been no official announcement at this stage for Nintendo platforms.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, Square Enix is focused on bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> to the Switch 2 this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Matt Firor founded Zenimax Online in 2007 and helped Bethesda shepherd<em> The Elder Scrolls Online</em> into one of the premier MMORPGs out there. He left abruptly last summer when Microsoft laid off dozens at the studio amid a wider bloodbath at the company and canceled the upcoming online multiplayer game he and others were working on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/blackbird-mmorpg-leaks-gta-dan-houser-eso-free-2000615981">Project Blackbird</a>. He recently broke his silence on the reason for his departure, confirming what fans had long suspected.</p> <p>“Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation,” Firor wrote in a January 1 post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;which he later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdsbjnwwyzxwz3b4lqtbtwd5/post/3mbeicw5hgw2f?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.pcgamer.com%252Fgames%252Fmmo%252Fformer-elder-scrolls-online-chief-confirms-microsofts-2025-bloodbath-drove-his-departure-from-zenimax-project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create%252F">shared on Bluesky</a>. “My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.”</p>   <p>The post never mentions Microsoft directly and doesn’t take aim at the decision makers at Xbox, which acquired Zenimax Online in 2021, but the move clearly left a very bad taste in many veteran developers’ mouths. Some of Firor’s former colleagues went on to form Sackbird Studios to work on their own multiplayer game. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” they <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663">wrote last year</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that Blackbird was an ambitious loot shooter that mixed elements of <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> with the structure and questlines of an MMORPG. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer reportedly played a build of the game last March and loved what he saw, making its eventual cancelation even more perplexing. The layoffs and cuts came as Xbox game studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reportedly tasked</a> with achieving a controversial 30-percent profit margin despite being forced to make all of their games playable for free on Game Pass.</p>

              <p>The first free monthly <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-december-2025-extra-assassins-creed-jrpg-2000652236">PlayStation Plus games</a> for paying subscribers in 2026 have been revealed and it’s a sleepy month for PS5 and PS4 players. There are also only three additions for this month, compared to last month’s five.</p> <p>On December 31, Sony revealed the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">first batch of PS Plus Essential games</a> coming this year and while they’re decent games, none of the picks make a big splash. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently beginning on January 6. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Need For Speed Unbound</em> | PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Core Keeper</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Rebrushed</em> is the 2024 remaster of the 2010 platformer from <em>Deus Ex</em> director Warren Spector. Nice for anyone who didn’t play the original or wants an important lesson in game development history. <em>Unbound</em>, meanwhile, is the 25th installment in the&nbsp;<em>Need for Speed</em> series and features a neat cel-shaded art style. The 2022 release is a fun racer but far from the most memorable in the franchise.</p>

 <p><em>Core Keeper</em> is arguably the best pick-up this month. It’s a top-down pixel art crafting sim that marries <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Like those games it continues to receive meaty free updates, with one coming later this month called Void &amp; Voltage. Not the worst month overall, though not as generous as last month’s <a href="http://PlayStation Plus games">pre-holiday haul</a>.</p>
