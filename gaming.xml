Reporting its financials for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, Sony failed to provide an updated sales figure, but did highlight the game in its webcast, reviewed and transcribed by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the studio business, Ghost of Yotei, a tentpole title we released in October, exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time and significantly contributed to the financial results of the quarter,” Lin Tao, Sony's chief financial officer, said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our established live service titles like Helldivers 2 and MLB The Show also contributed stable recurring revenue.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement here is a little vague (we assume “same period of time” reflects each game's first quarter on sale, which would be the first three months of availability), but Sony sounds happy with Ghost of Yotei either way. How exactly does it compare to Ghost of Tsushima? Ghost of Tsushima, which was initially released for PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). Latest sales figures provided by Sony show Ghost of Tsushima on 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut, as of August 11, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We should consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and released into the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point this year, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review"><u>Ghost of Yotei review</u></a>.

<p>A hollow promise?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="3f39f5339d751"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f39f5339d751/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-coming-2026-hollow-knight-switch-2-edition-also-announced">we learned</a> that the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> would be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of its own at some point in 2026. In true Team Cherry style, things have been radio silent ever since, but a newly-emerged PEGI rating may suggest that we're closer to release than we had initially expected (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight">official PEGI website</a>, Switch 2 has been added to the Hollow Knight platform list, under the original game's '7' age rating. The rating cites "mild violence to fantasy characters and pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children" as the reason for this classification, none of which is all that surprising if you've ever set foot in Deepnest *<em>shudders</em>*.</p>
<p>The other thing worth pointing out is that the Switch 2 version is accompanied by a release date of 5th February 2026. Tha- that's today!</p>
<figure data-uuid="0007ea4604dc3"><a title="Hollow Knight PEGI Rating" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0007ea4604dc3/hollow-knight-pegi-rating.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight">PEGI</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, this <em>might</em> be nothing, and we actually have months to go before we get to dive into Hallownest again. PEGI ratings have a habit of cropping up out of the blue with a 'release date' that seems to correspond to the date that the rating was added rather than the date the game was released — see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hi-fi-rush-has-been-rated-for-the-switch-again">15th January Switch date</a> from last month.</p>
<p>But we can't help but notice that there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-today-5th-february-2026">Partner Direct</a> today, and we suppose a shadow drop for this kind of thing <em>could</em> be on the cards.</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what the showcase brings. For reference, Team Cherry has confirmed that Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will boast "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions and many additional graphical effects", and it'll be available as a free upgrade to all those with the Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we also have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Sea of Sorrow</a>' expansion to look forward to at some point this year. While Team Cherry said it was keeping "further details a secret for now" at its reveal back in December, it teased new areas, bosses, tools and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted its own quarterly financial report</a>, revealing that <strong>PS5 shipments have now reached 92.2 million units</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up from 84.2 million units declared in the previous quarter</a>. This means that Sony sold <span><strong>8 million PlayStation 5 consoles in its fiscal Q3</strong>, a rather significant (<strong>-15.8%</strong>) decrease from</span> Q3 2024. </p>



<p>This is only slightly offset by marginally better PS5 shipments in Q1 and Q2 2025 compared to the previous year. Overall, in FY 2024, <strong>Sony had shipped 15.7 million units as of Q3</strong>, whereas this year, the total fiscal year sales to date amount to <strong>14.4 million units</strong>, or <strong>-8.3%</strong>.</p>



<p>Despite the downward trajectory, cumulative PS5 shipments are not at all far from where the PlayStation 4 was at the same point in its lifecycle. The PS4 had sold <strong>94.4 million units</strong>, but <strong>it also faced far less adversity than the PS5 did</strong>; the most recent Sony console had to deal with the semiconductor shortage at first, and now the RAM shortages aren't helping, either. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SDKTavm-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Credits to ResetEra's Red Kong XIX for making this chart: <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-92-2-million-lifetime-console-units-shipped-8-million-units-last-quarter.1426120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-92-2-million-lifetime-console-units-shipped-8-million-units-last-quarter.1426120</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's far from all bad news for the PlayStation division, though. Full game software sales (between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5) increased to <strong>97.2 million units</strong> sold, <strong>up 1.4%</strong> compared to last year. That's mostly thanks to first-party sales, which reached <strong>13.2 million units</strong> in the quarter, a <strong>13.8%</strong> increase compared to 2024's <strong>11.6 million units</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the game leading the charge was <strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong> by <strong>Sucker Punch Productions</strong>, by far the biggest PS5 exclusive game released in FY 2025. Indeed, during the FY2025 Q3 earnings call, Sony Chief Financial Officer <strong>Lin Tao</strong> shared that the game has exceeded the sales of its predecessor, <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong>, when launch aligned.</p>



<p>Sony did not provide an actual update to sales figures. However, we know that Ghost of Tsushima sold 2.4 million units in the first three days, but only reached 5 million units 118 days (nearly four months) after launch. By contrast, Ghost of Yotei sold 3.3 million units in 32 days. <strong>This means Tsushima must have taken slightly longer to reach that milestone</strong>. Even if it's only a marginal improvement, though, it's actually more meaningful when you consider that Tsushima was released at the height of the COVID pandemic and benefited from a much larger install base than Ghost of Yōtei. Given these positive sales figures, it's hard to imagine Sony won't greenlight a Ghost of Yōtei DLC, and indeed, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-developer-doesnt-close-door-to-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have already suggested there's a chance it will happen</a></strong>.</p>



<p>At some point in 2026, Sucker Punch is scheduled to launch the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legends online co-op mode</a></strong>. It is also believed that <strong>the debut of Legends might coincide with the game's PC launch</strong>, though that's just speculation for now.</p>

Each of the weapons available in the game has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extensive movesets</strong> that require multiple button combinations to accommodate the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">huge Martial Arts loadout</strong> that has now become typical for the series.</p>



<p><span>While&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;<strong>streamlines the complexity</strong>&nbsp;of its predecessor's controls and button combinations, it adds unexpected <strong>mechanical challenges</strong>&nbsp;that make it difficult to <strong>consistently unleash Martial Arts set to specific motion and button combinations.</strong></span></p>



<p>Complete The Shogun's Preparation: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">change this setting ASAP</strong> to improve combat flow and <strong>ultimately make fighting enemies more enjoyable.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-change-the-controls-to-type-b-asap">Change the Controls to Type B ASAP</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Controls-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Type B proved the best control scheme for me in Nioh 3 as it made it easier to use certain Martial Arts more consistently</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> comes with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">six control scheme options,</strong> which move some of the game's core combat actions between different buttons. While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Type A control scheme</strong> generally works well (though you may need some time to adjust if you're coming straight from <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh 2</strong></a></em>) I have found in my over 50 hours with the game <strong>not to be the best</strong> for one specific reason: <strong>the difficulty to <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">use some Martial Arts</a> consistently.</strong></p>



<p>As opposed to the first two entries in the series, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> assigns quite a few <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">critical Martial Arts</strong> in both Samurai and Ninja style to <strong>forward + button and back + button combinations</strong>, leaving the <strong>L1 /LB + button combination free for Guardian Spirit skills.</strong></p>



<p><strong>These button combinations make using specific Martial Arts really unreliable</strong>. While the forward + button combination is a little more reliable, I have had a lot of trouble using the back + button Martial Arts consistently, forcing me to <strong>buffer the input behind a regular attack string.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">this forces a playstyle that is not good for certain weapons</strong>. Take the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style Hatchets</strong>, for example: assigned to the back + heavy attack slot is the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Dragonfly Martial Art</strong>, which is incredibly useful from a distance, but far riskier to use close to the enemy, a positioning the Type A controls essentially forced me into.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Type-B-better-controls-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Type B controls made me enjoy Nioh 3's combo potential in combat way more</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you, like me, are having trouble with these Martial Arts button combinations, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">switch the Control Type to B</strong>. This control scheme <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">restores the L1/LB + button combination for Martial Arts</strong> from previous entries in the series, switching the <strong>Guardian Skill button combos to L1/LB + up and L1/LB + down on the directional pad.</strong></p>



<p>The difference, you will soon notice, will be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">night and day</strong>, no matter your weapon of choice. In my case, I was able to use the Samurai Dual Swords counterattack <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Punish the Proud</strong> Martial Art previously assigned to back + heavy attack <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">much more consistently</strong>. Aerial combat in Ninja Style was also significantly improved, as aerial Martial Arts became more reliable with more consistent execution.</p>

            <p>If you keep an eye on the big, ambitious Fallout mods that're always in the works, you might have heard of Fallout: Revelation Blues. Its developers have been plugging away at remaking Van Buren - the version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> which was in development at Black Isle Studios before being cancelled in 2003 - as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> mod for the past few years. While they released a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-new-vegas-mod-revelation-blues-demo-van-buren">first demo last year</a> under the Revelation Blues moniker, the group have decided to re-christen their project Fallout: The New West ahead of releasing a second demo at some point soon.</p>

<p>Ahead of that, the name change has been set in stone by the release of the fresh teaser above and the launch of a <a href="https://falloutthenewwest.com/">new website</a>. Why the switch from Revelation Blues? Well, one of the mod's devs going by the handle Caveman6667 has explained on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1447407535437905920">Discord</a> that the group concluded Revelation Blues was "a mystery of a name for many passersby and isn't a grabby title". The New West, meanwhile, they feel fits the mod better, as it'll feature "many allusions and references to the Old West".</p>
<p>So, out with the old and in the New West as the modders gear up to release a second demo, this time focused around Van Buren's opening sequence. You're in Tibbets prison, a pen run by an AI dubbed Odysseus, and you've gotta break out of that joint while a new plague's also on the loose in the section of American southwest the mod's set in. The modders wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1468679368711864462">Discord post</a> put out alongside the teaser that they're "fairly confident" they could put a release date on this Tibbets demo right now, but have instead elected to play it safe and simply declare they're "very very very close" to delivering it.</p><p>As outlined on the sparkly new website, the New West crew's current plan is to get this "alternate start demo" out of the way, then "follow it up with the entirety of act one of the game as a vertical slice". If you're keen for a taster of what the mod's full experience'll be like, they've also provided the following handy blurb outlining its key tenets and aims:</p>
<blockquote><p>In many ways, it tells the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience. The project’s primary narrative goal is to take the disparate plot threads and unfinished concepts found in the original design documents, including for example, the NCR–Brotherhood conflict, the Great Tribal War between Caesar’s Legion and the Daughters of Hecate, the fight for the soul of the Mormon State and much more, and weave them into a satisfying, unified narrative that adheres to the main plot as described in the design documents.</p>
<p>Players assume the role of a new protagonist,released from captivity in 2253, known as "the Prisoner", and the story is set in an alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas. Unfortunately due to many Van Buren concepts being folded into FNV, we cannot set the project in the same timeline. Our secondary goal is to incorporate many of the modern gameplay conveniences introduced through Fallout: New Vegas and its more than fifteen years of modding, while preserving the distinctive mechanics and design quirks of classic Fallout found in the original design documents.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I'm not as voracious a Van Buren lore sponge as other Fallout enjoyers, the New West's re-creation of a wasteland adventure we never got has certainly piqued my interest, so here's hoping the upcoming demo's a good one. If you fancy giving the mod's first demo - Burham Springs - a go in the interim you can find it on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91191?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-is-beating-tsushima-in-sales-sony-reveals/</link>
            <guid>1426258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony’s CFO has revealed that Ghost of Yotei’s sales have performed better than those of Tsushima in the same period. </p>



<p>One of the biggest releases for Sony PlayStation this year was Ghost of Yotei, the highly anticipated sequel to Sucker Punch’s 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima. Sony had confirmed that the title sold 3.3 million copies in the first month, and the budget was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yoteis-budget-is-very-similar-to-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very similar</a> to the previous title. Now we know that the latest instalment is also performing better. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-sold-better-than-tsushima-in-the-same-period">Ghost of Yotei Sold Better than Tsushima in the Same Period</h2>



<p>Sony CFO Lin Tao’s comments on Ghost of Yotei sales were revealed through an <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019316878162948307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN. Tao stated that Yotei was a “tentpole title” released in 2025 and “exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time.” Sucker Punch’s latest instalment also contributed “significantly” to the financial results of the latest quarter. </p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei was released on October 2, 2025, for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 5 Pro. We have yet to receive an announcement for a PC version, which could help boost the sales event further. Yotei has been out for a little over 4 months, and its performance during this period has been better than Tsushima’s. No sales figures were revealed. </p>



<p>What else could help boost the sales is a DLC for the title, and the developers have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a potential expansion</a>. It just depends on whether they feel players really want to know more about a particular relationship or story element in the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Sucker Punch could work on a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly Cooper or Infamous</a> game next. Additionally, here are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 games</a> like Yotei you can play after finishing it.

			<p>Just a few hours after <strong>AMD CEO</strong> <strong>Lisa Su</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-steam-machine-will-start-shipping-early-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly shared that they expected the <strong>Steam Machine</strong> to start shipping in <strong>early 2026</strong></a>, <strong>Valve</strong> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steam_hardware/announcements/detail/625565405086220584?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an update</a> revealing there will actually be a slight delay.</p>



<p>In a blog post dedicated to launch timing and other FAQs for the whole family of upcoming <strong>Steam Hardware</strong> products, Valve admitted they've had to revisit the shipping schedule and pricing <strong>due to the ongoing memory and storage shortages <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that have hit the tech industry hard</a></strong>. They had hoped to be able to share both the launch and price details by now, but that just wasn't possible yet, with the Steam Machine and <strong>Steam Frame</strong> particularly affected (while, on the other hand, the <strong>Steam Controller</strong> obviously won't include any RAM or storage; but Valve wants to start selling it alongside the other two).</p>



<p>Valve's goal is to launch all of the products <strong>in the first half of 2026</strong>. From the sound of it, though, they are now targeting the latter months of Spring, perhaps toward May or June, whereas before it really sounded like it could have launched in March or April.</p>



<p><strong>Customers are certainly worried more about the pricing</strong> than the slight delay. The RAM shortage has driven component prices to absurd levels, and even console manufacturers like <strong>Nintendo</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haven't definitively ruled out price bumps for their hardware</a> if the situation doesn't improve. The Steam Machine was already going to have a hefty price tag, at least compared to a typical console, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because Valve won't subsidize it</a></strong>. Earlier this year, a Czech retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-leak-valve/">listed a price of <strong>$950</strong> for the base model with 512GB of storage, while the 2TB model would cost </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-leak-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1070</a></strong>. Those prices are not confirmed by any means, though.</p>



<p>In the new blog post, Valve also shared a few FAQs for the Steam Hardware family. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine">Steam Machine</h2>



<ul>
<li>Valve reiterated that most Steam games can run at 4K@60FPS on the Steam Machine with AMD FSR. However, <strong>they also acknowledged that some titles will be more taxing, and users might need to play at a lower frame rate with VRR enabled and a 1080p internal resolution</strong>. Meanwhile, they are working on HDMI VRR, <strong>investigating improved upscaling</strong>, and <strong>optimizing ray tracing performance</strong> in the Steam Machine driver.</li>



<li>It was confirmed that the <strong>SSD</strong> (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and <strong>RAM</strong> (DDR5 SODIMMs) are both <strong>user-accessible and upgradable</strong>.</li>



<li>In the coming months, Valve will begin sharing faceplate CAD models, specs, and details so manufacturers can make and sell third-party faceplates to users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-steam-frame">Steam Frame</h2>



<ul>
<li>Streaming services should work in a 'theatrical browser mode'.</li>



<li><strong>People wearing glasses shouldn't have problems with the Steam Frame</strong>, though it depends on the width of the glasses. Still, Valve would like to make prescription lens inserts available ahead of launch.</li>



<li>The Steam Frame will include a new feature called <strong>Foveated Streaming</strong>. Based on the eye-tracking data, the PC streams high-resolution data only to the portion of the viewport the player is looking at. This is a system-level feature, so it can be applied to all games to improve performance. Furthermore, it can stack with <strong>Foveated Rendering</strong> (which allows a game to render only the portion the player is looking at) if the game supports that feature.</li>



<li>The <strong>Valve Index</strong> will continue to be supported by Valve, as it has in the past.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-steam-controller">Steam Controller</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Steam Controller is expected to work with any game compatible with the Steam Overlay, even if they aren't actually on Steam.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-machine-is-still-on-track-for-its-original-release-window-according-to-valves-chosen-chipmakers">AMD’s assurances to the contrary</a>, Valve have announced that they’ve pushed back release plans for the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> VR headset. Alas, my curse of publishing news posts roughly 0.0045 seconds before a major situation change continues to ruin my life – sometimes I wish I’d never beaten the warlocks in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> pub match.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Instead of "early 2026," the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">original release window</a>, Valve are now only aiming to ship the hardware trio "in the first half of the year." No prizes for guessing the cause, either: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">Steam blog post</a> notes specifically that ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">memory and SSD shortages</a>, caused by the tech industry buying up components to build infrastructure for AI products, have both scuppered the initial launch plans and delayed Valve’s decision on how the Steam Machine and its brethren will be priced.</p>
<p>"When we announced these products in November," the post reads, "we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now. But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).</p>
<p>"Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible."</p><p>If the Machine, Controller, and Frame <em>do</em> arrive in the first half of 2026, that ultimately wouldn’t be an interminable wait beyond the originally announced window. Higher-than-expected prices seem like a given, though, particularly for the Machine and the Frame. The Steam Controller might at least dodge the blow of the economics hammer, as it contains neither a fat SSD nor a pile of RAM.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is bitterly add "Hopes of a cheap living room PC" to the list of all the things that the AI uranium rush has destroyed, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">general component pricing</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">Crucial</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game developers’ opinions of AI</a>.</p>

However, due to industry-standard revenue splits, aggressive recoup models, and passive investors, the devs see income months later and are a sadly small slice of the pie, often that is enough to shut down a promising studio.

            <title><![CDATA[When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up? Fortnite February 5 Downtime, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-servers-downtime-february-5/</link>
            <guid>1426201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite players around the world have been locked out of the game on February 5 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, with players impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to be back up.</p>



<p>After a huge South Park collab in January, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is entering a new month with a fresh drop of content, keeping the game alive until the next major seasonal change early in March.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime and everything coming in the February 5 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Servers are down for several hours for the update on February 5, and there is no confirmed time of their return. However, previous updates indicate how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, which means that the Fortnite servers should be back up after the v39.40 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, downtime can be longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy, and social media is the best place to keep track of the server status.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-5-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 5 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest addition in the February 5 update in Fortnite is the start of a new Fortnite Festival season, with Chappell Roan as the headline act.</strong></p>



<p>After plenty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks and rumors</a>, her inclusion as the star of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> was revealed by Epic Games, and the new season, of course, means a new Festival Pass to progress through.</p>



<p>In the Battle Royale scene, the South Park collab has now completed, with the Born in Chaos Mini Pass expiring. Unfortunately, if you didn’t complete the pass, those free rewards are now unavailable, though they could return to the Item Shop for purchase in the future.</p>



<p>The Valentine’s Day event is also set to be added, though the dates for its duration are not yet confirmed, and there’s a slew of big collabs coming to the Item Shop, including the second wave of KPop Demon Hunters and two character skins from Marvel Rivals; Magik and Luna Snow.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve time strikes again. Three months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">announcing a trio of new hardware products</a>, including the Steam Machine, Steam Frame and Steam Controller, Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">blog post detailing their delay</a>. The new hardware was meant to arrive in the first quarter of this year, but this has now been "revisited" to the first half of the year due to the "memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about". </p>
<p>The Steam Machine is likely the major catalyst behind the decision, as the sharp rise in RAM and storage prices could force a rethink for a living room box that was intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">bridge the gap between consoles and entry-level PCs</a>. With RAM and storage prices doubling, tripling or even quadrupling over the past three months, even the relatively modest base model with 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 512GB will now cost significantly more to produce. </p>
<p>For context, the cheapest 16GB DDR5 SODIMM kit has <a href="https://zdcs.link/98AyY1">more than doubled in price on Amazon UK</a>, from £67 on Valve's November announcement date to £148 today. A 512GB 2230 NVMe SSD of the type used by Valve in the Steam Machine has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8YMG">also rocketed up in price</a>, from £54 to £88 in the same time period. If we look at 2TB drives, it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxg3D">a steeper climb</a>, from £129 to £244. </p>
<p>Valve isn't paying consumer prices from Amazon, of course, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">these price surges are a worldwide affair</a> that have affected nearly every part of the PC industry. The situation could even postpone the release of the next generation of games consoles. </p><p>While the Steam Machine is the most obviously affected, the Steam Frame VR headset is also a miniature Snapdragon-powered gaming PC, with its own 16GB of LPDDR5X memory and 256GB or 1TB of storage, and its pricing will therefore need to be reconsidered. Previously, Valve had indicated that it expected the Frame to undercut the Valve Index in price, which retails for £919. The Steam Controller is the only member of the trio relatively immune to the current climate, though its launch is necessarily tied to the other two products. </p>
<p>Valve's post states that it expected to be able to share pricing and availability data by now, so it will be interesting to see how long it will take the Washingtonian firm to release revised information. In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">the recent blog</a> to see a few more frequently-asked questions answered, on topics including RAM/storage upgradability, ongoing support for the Valve Index and expected Steam Machine performance figures, with more blogs to come over the coming weeks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>South Korean video game publisher Krafton, Inc. has announced that PUBG: Blindspot, the free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter developed by PUBG Studios, is now available on Steam via Early Access. The team describes the game as being "designed around fast, high-intensity indoor firefights" that mix close-quarters battles and team-based strategies with a top-down perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Krafton, which made headlines last October after touting that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">it would transform into an "AI-first company,"</a> says in a press release that today's Early Access launch marks the beginning of an open development phase, "with the development team actively working alongside players to refine gameplay systems and expand content" ahead of the game's 1.0 release. PUBG Studios adds that player feedback will play a central role in shaping the game with updates designed around depth, balance, and quality.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Maps</h3><p>PUBG: Blindspot is the first spinoff of the mega-popular battle royale grandfather (though that's a heavily debated topic), PUBG, and takes place decades after the events of the original game. The head of the IP, Taesok Jang, says, "Starting with PUBG: Blindspot, the PUBG IP will continue to expand into new genres and platforms."&nbsp;</p><p>Today's launch precedes Competitive Season 1, which will launch next week on February 12. You can download the game right now on Steam, or play the game via Nvidia GeForce Now streaming.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Characters</h3><p>If you've played any of the game's betas, you'll find some new content in today's Early Access release, like a defense-exclusive character with Molotov-based arena control, according to the press release.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out PUBG: Blindspot?

<p>Following its release on Switch and Switch 2 last December</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="15948a6745072"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15948a6745072/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There was some shock earlier this week when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/heres-a-look-at-the-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-games-so-far">Nintendo's financials</a> seemingly confirmed that neither the Switch or Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> had cracked one million sales. So, how about the combined figures?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File journalist Stephen Totilo</a> has now reached out to Nintendo and got an official confirmation from a representative that the "combined sales" of the two titles have surpassed the one million mark. Here's the message relayed on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following some consternation yesterday about neither the Switch nor Switch 2 versions of Metroid Prime 4 (Dec. 4) making Nintendo's million-seller list for the period ending Dec 31, a Nintendo rep confirmed to me today that the combined sales of those 2 versions have in fact passed a million copies"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceqhozsg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Nintendo hasn't released the exact sales figures for either version, or the combined figures in this case, but this latest update likely puts these sales more in line with the typical performance of the Prime series, even if the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-sales-have-got-off-to-a-slow-start">individual releases got off to a slow start</a>.</p>
<p>The side-scroller entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, which released on the Switch in 2021, is currently the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> series' best-selling game, with over three million sales. As for how Beyond stacks up against <em>other</em> Prime releases, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> game remains the most successful entry, and the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Remaster</a> on the Switch was able to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230509_4e.pdf">surpass the million mark</a> in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not known if Beyond has actually met Nintendo's sales expectations at this early stage, and there are many other factors to consider, including the title's lengthy development cycle, its cross-generation release, and a launch window in one of the busiest years on record for Nintendo - with the Switch 2 just getting started.</p>

<p>The Sony PlayStation 5 can officially claim victory over the Nintendo Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>



<p>Sony recently released its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 FY2025 earnings.</a> The data show that 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>units were sold in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In the same quarter, Nintendo sold 7.01 million Switch 2 units. Of note, this was the first full quarter with the Nintendo Switch successor on the market.</p>



<p>The Sony PS5 has been on the market since 2020 and has sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-passes-90-million-units-sold/" id="174295"> over 90 million units </a>to date. The<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2 </a>was released in June 2025 and had <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold 17.37 million units </a>as of New Year’s Eve 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-battle-between-sony-and-nintendo-rages-on">The Battle Between Sony and Nintendo Rages on</h2>



<p>Although Sony had a stronger quarter, the Switch 2 outsold the PS5 in the United States in 2025. Nintendo’s original Switch is currently the second-best-selling console of all time, with 155.37 million units sold. However, Sony’s PS2 remains the best-selling console a quarter of a century after its release, with 160 million units sold worldwide.</p>







<p>Sony’s PlayStation 6 may not be released until 2027, giving Nintendo a head start in this generation. Learn more about the potential release of a PS6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" id="151319">here</a>. Even Xbox, which acts more as a publisher in today’s console market, may not have its next<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" id="94492"> hardware release until 2027.</a></p>

<p>Sony has reached another milestone in PlayStation 5 sales.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to its latest financial report,</a> Sony sold 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>consoles in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025. As of September 30, Sony was boasting more than 84.1 million sales. This means that, based on the new data, more than 90 million PS5 consoles have been sold.</p>



<p>Despite this milestone, PS5 sales remain down 1.5 million year over year, with 9.5 million consoles sold in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024.</p>











<p>New data also reveal that combined PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 software sales totaled 97.2 million units. According to Sony, this total covers all PS4 and PS5 titles, including those bundled with PlayStation consoles and PlayStation VR.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are 132 million active users on the PlayStation Network as of the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025. This number is slightly up from 129 million in the same quarter of the previous year.</p>







<p>While Sony had a strong 2025, Nintendo still led the United States in hardware sales for the year with its Nintendo Switch 2 console.

<p>The Heavy, Max and the rest of the gang are back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Here's a blast from the past! Developer Skunkape Games (the team founded by former Telltale employees who revived the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sam_and_max_the_complete_trilogy">Sam &amp; Max</a> series) has today announced the return of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poker_night_at_the_inventory">Poker Night at the Inventory</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This poker title featuring an all-star cast of video game characters (Max - Sam &amp; Max, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/strong_bad_episode_1_homestar_ruiner">Strong Bad</a> - Homestar Runner, Tycho - Penny Arcade and The Heavy - <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>) was originally developed by Telltale Games for Steam in 2010 and was delisted in 2019.</p>
<p>The new version has been "lovingly remastered" and will be reopening its doors for Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>. Players can expect overhauled graphics and lighting, along with gameplay fixes to improve the overall poker simulation.</p>
<p>There are also new unlockables (including the return of TF2 items on Steam) and quality-of-life features - with the game updated using the "same engine as the team's recent remasters of the Sam &amp; Max trilogy". Here's some additional information via the Steam listing, and you can check out the official trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently reopened following a seismic retrofit, the Inventory is once again the hottest gathering place for video game characters to unwind after a long day on the job. Drop in to play No Limit Texas Hold’em with four familiar faces: Max, Strong Bad, Tycho, and The Heavy.</p>
<p>From the archives of Telltale Games, this jokey poker game pits iconic characters against the Player (that’s you!) in a high-stakes battle of cards, bets, and trash talk.</p>
<p>Each tournament you win brings you closer to unlocking a new hidden table design or custom card deck, each with new art unique to one of your opponent’s home franchises. Some of the decks and table felts have hidden properties that change the look of a character at the table, or the game itself. Keep an eye out for new unlocks created just for this release.</p>
<p>The Inventory and its guests look better than ever, with a top-to-bottom visual refresh, featuring higher resolution models, a more detailed environment, crisper animation, and new lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to tuning how much table talk you want to hear, you can now change the starting buy-in amount to literally raise or lower the stakes. There are also some new graphics features to up the filmic ambiance, like optional cinematic motion blur and film grain (they're off by default).</p>
<p>The team stripped Poker Night’s original poker code down to parts, scraped the gunk away, and rebuilt it better than new. Poker Night at the Inventory now plays a far more accurate game of poker, and your opponents will make more informed decisions that better fit their play style and personality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Says Its New Console Plays The ‘Majority’ Of Steam Games At 4K 60FPS With FSR]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-resolution-framerate-specs-2000665807</link>
            <guid>1426090</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve still hasn’t revealed the full breakdown of what’s inside its new Steam Machine console or how much it will cost. Those details were delayed along <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">with the device’s “early” 2026 launch</a> due to an AI-fueled PC part shortage. But the company did offer a fresh clue about how the mini-computer will perform, and it almost sounds too good to be true.</p> <p>“In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS with FSR on Steam Machine,” the company <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">wrote in a new update</a> on February 4. “That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution. In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.”</p>

 <p>Steam users are…skeptical. “I don’t see how that’s possible on many, if not most current AAA games,” wrote one commenter. “The hardware just isn’t there. Isn’t this supposed to be a 3050 or lower class device?” Another wrote, “I don’t think the hardware is capable of delivering this promise. I have a 12 GB 3060. Which, presumably, is a significantly more powerful GPU than the one being offered. But it’s a still a lower-end GPU and I’m not playing any AAA games at 4K.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">It’s hard to know what exactly that means</a> since thousands of new games come to Steam every year and most of them are small indie games that aren’t very demanding to run. The Steam Machine might run <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> at 4K 60FPS no problem, but what about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Crimson Desert</em>, both AAA blockbusters coming to Valve’s storefront over the next couple of months? Not to mention all of the games that launched last year with PC performance issues like<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p>

 <p>If the Steam Machine can pull off 4K 60FPS for even some of those big games without too much frame generation or upscaling, it would have a lot to offer not just console players but people coming from lower-end or very dated PC gaming rigs. But it also probably won’t come cheap. Then again, in this new world where gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">gets more expensive every year</a>, who’s to say what even still counts as “cheap.”</p>
