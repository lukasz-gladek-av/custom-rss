            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-can%E2%80%99t-have-one-without-the-other.1130661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pirate-yakuza-hawaii-impressions-review-majima<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I get asked a lot what it is I like about <em>Yakuza</em>, and I usually start with how much I enjoy kicking bicycles into people's faces, move on to its love for Japanese urban spaces and their sense of place, then wind up with some appreciation for its soap opera storytelling. Sometimes that will prompt a follow-up along the lines of "those are some very different things", to which I can reply "yes, that's the <em>point</em>".</p><p><em>Yakuza </em>is a series built on its contradictions. Yes, it's a hilarious adventure through a heavily-fictionalised Japanese underworld, as a cast of losers and misfits find themselves in the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable, from underground fights against giant tigers to street battles against lubed-up sex predators.</p><p>But at the same time, between and throughout those moments, it's also one of the most sincere video game franchises on the planet. Some <em>real shit</em> goes down over the course of a 100-hour <em>Yakuza </em>game, including genuine, heartfelt attempts at exploring fatherhood, fraternity and what it means to belong to something and defend those you love.</p><p>There's even contradiction in the series' gameplay. Sombre walks through rain-soaked streets can give way to bruising fistfights against a band of thugs at breakneck speed, and ten minutes after fighting for your life in a cinematic rooftop battle you can be inside an arcade playing <em>Virtual On</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like A Dragon Pirate Yakuza: official musical number opening" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BswWPFDcdlI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I had an adverse physical reaction to this musical intro</figcaption></figure></div><p>None of these things on their own are what makes <em>Yakuza </em>great. It's the duality itself that defines the series. The dumb stuff is so good because it stands in such stark contrast to all the heavy stuff, and moments of sincerity hit you so hard because your emotional guard can be down after 45 minutes of remote-control car racing.</p><p>I basically said much of this already last year<a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-tv-adaptation-does-the-only-thing-it-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when discussing the series' live-action Amazon adaptation</a>, which tries some interesting things when it comes to <em>Yakuza's</em> timeline, but ultimately failed because:</p><blockquote><p>...the straight-laced sitting alongside (and being frequently punctuated by) the absurd, is what makes Yakuza Yakuza. Kiryu isn't Kiryu if he's not splitting his time between grimly serious dialogue and a batting cage. So seeing him portrayed as he is in this TV series, with only the drama, is like seeing yin without yang, light without shadow. He's only half a man, and this is only half a show.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Now here we are just a few months later and I'm about to say the same things about a new game in the series. From the vibes to the setting to the fact we’re playing (in that particular setting) as longtime fan favourite Goro Majima, nearly everything about <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii </em>felt off from the moment it was first announced. Matt Elliott's review for <em>Eurogamer</em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>nailed the questionable energy</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Even the choice of protagonist—the pleasantly unhinged Goro Majima - a man who, right now, you’re probably imagining screaming, stabbing, or both - speaks to a heightened sense of throwaway irreverence. It's the sort of concept people who don't play Yakuza probably think series obsessives would love, when, actually, all we want is to try all the different whiskies at a sunakku bar in the Champion District.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That paragraph basically nails the <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> experience for me. The whole game feels slightly off, like it was pitched by someone who had never actually played a <em>Yakuza </em>game but had wet their finger, stuck it in the air and tried to gauge the series' appeal from the thinnest of breezes coming from the general direction of the series’ fandom. Yeah, the game is full of gags and wild shit and bombastic sequences, but you can't just do <em>anything </em>weird and pass it off as <em>Yakuza </em>when the series has two decades of a very specific <em>kind </em>of weirdness.</p><p>Goro Majima has existed throughout the <em>Yakuza </em>series as a foil to Kazuma Kiryu. They're an inseparable duo, right down to the fact we had to play as both of them in prequel <em>Yakuza 0</em> to get their full story. They're Batman and The Joker, Abbott and Costello. Majima's craziness works when it's in contrast<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> to the stoic Kiryu</a>, but even alone, his craziness works within the context of his character. His origin story, explored in<em> Yakuza 0</em>, is tragic, and his later years, where his life's meaning as part of the Yakuza has been taken away from him, are painfully melancholy. His bio is "crazy guy" in only the most reductive way; Majima is such a wonderful character because he's crazy in spite of everything, not just <em>because</em>.</p><p>In this game, though? He's got a very convenient case of amnesia, so for most of the storyline all that context goes right out the window. He spends the bulk of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> as a cardboard cutout, a "hey guys, look how wacky Goro Majima is, he's a pirate captain wearing stupid clothes in 2025!" schtick in ways the game somehow manages to explain, but can never actually make <em>work</em>. He's all joke, no brakes, and the whole game feels paper-thin as a result.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - Minato Girls Sidequest FULL WALKTHROUGH | Part 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j49I-m7ulsA?start=2161&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The series' recent dips into creepy FMV sequences enter a fresh hell in Pirate Yakuza</figcaption></figure></div><p>Even when it tries (and fails) to more seriously examine Majima and his past, there's just no gravity in this game. It's the outline of a <em>Yakuza </em>game with none of the depth, a series of bullet points being ticked--outfits, check; diversions, check; combat, check--as though <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> wasn't an actual part of the series, but was something being made by someone else, tracing over it.</p><p>I'm not saying this is a <em>bad video game</em>. <em>Yakuza </em>is nothing if not dependable, so there is the scaffolding of the series experience here if that's solely what you're into: lots of gags, punishing melee combat, retro video games, some baseball. The highlight of all the diversions, though, is actually its surprisingly detailed naval combat, harking back to <em>Assassin's Creed Black Flag</em> and its combination of ship-to-ship battles that can culminate with a brawl on the deck. Only here you also have machine guns.</p><p>But it is a bad <em>Yakuza </em>game. This series is no stranger to spinoffs, but even the worst of them--like <em>Dead Souls</em>--have always had some trace of <em>Yakuza </em>energy to them. The most successful deviations, the <em>Judgment </em>series, are probably the best example of what has gone wrong here: They showed it was gangland drama and a cityscape that was key to the appeal of <em>Yakuza</em>, not any one character or storyline in particular. <em>Pirate Yakuza's</em> reversal of that--casting a series stalwart in a novelty location and cranking the absurdity levels to max--feels like a prank game, only the joke doesn't land.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers"><h3>Luffy Would Never Be On My Starting Five</h3></a><p>The king of the pirates would not run point on any basketball team.

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann revealed some more narrative details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> in Creator to Creator discussion with Civil War director Alex Garland.</p><p>The studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-537795">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> revealed Intergalactic, a brand new sci-fi game meant to kickstart a franchise, at The Game Awards 2024. That announcement trailer revealed a fair bit about Intergalactic's premise, namely that it follows a bounty hunter who gets standard on the distant planet of Sempiria. Ahead of season 2 of the popular The Last of Us TV show, Druckmann appeared on Sony's Creators to Creators podcast for a discussion with film director Alex Garland, who is promoting the upcoming film 28 Years Later. Toward the end of the conversation, Druckmann revealed more about the universe Intergalactic is set in and Naughty Dog's goals with the project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iJUab499PVA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Druckmann highlights that Intergalactic will be "a game about faith and religion" and is set around 2000 years in the future in a universe that diverged from our own in the 1980s. He reveals that Naughty Dog has created 2000 years of history for the religion of Sempiria, which has been cut off from communication with the rest of the galaxy for the last 600 years prior to the start of the game. He also explained how Naughty Dog wants players to feel lonely and lost in a place whose people and history are mysterious to them.</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5 but does not have a release window at this time. Druckmann admits that the Naughty Dog "still have a ways to go" in developing the game and he doesn't have a clear idea of the final form Intergalactic will take just yet, so don't expect it to release soon.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Sony is testing out new AI software, and it's using a beloved character--Aloy from the Horizon series--to show it off.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-RJ7O9Tqf4">YouTube video</a> narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal--a software engineering director at Sony Interactive Entertainment who focuses on gaming tech, AI, and face technology for the Advanced Technology Group within Sony's PlayStation Studios--appeared online last week, giving players a look at an AI-ified version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>'s main character, Aloy.</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal verbally interacts with Aloy throughout the video, starting off by greeting her and asking how she's been doing.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hello, I'm managing alright," AI-Aloy replies flatly. "Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal then proceeds to ask Aloy if she's willing to discuss events that have taken place in the Horizon franchise, like her search for her mother.</p><p dir="ltr">"Certainly," Aloy says, replying to Raghoebardajal's request for info with all the well-acted intonation of a TikTok text-to-speech video. "I discovered I'm a clone of Dr. Elizabeth Sobeck, which allowed me to understand my purpose and origins."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked what it's like to be a clone, Aloy replies with nightmare-inducing mouth animations, saying, "Being a clone feels unique, connecting me to the past while allowing me to create my own path and future."</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Raghoebardajal requests that Aloy take him into the game world.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure, we'll transition to the game world now, get ready for the adventure ahead," Aloy replies in a tone so un-emotive it's rather hard to believe any sort of adventure awaits.</p><p dir="ltr">The screen goes black, then transitions to Horizon Forbidden West. Raghoebardajal continues communicating with Aloy in-game, asking her where they are. Using the same expressionless tone she's used for the entire video, Aloy explains that they're at The Scalding Spear, a large settlement near Arrowhand.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Raghoebardajal, AI is being used for Aloy's facial animations, verbal responses, and her voice itself. Notably, the Aloy in this demonstration sounds nothing like Aloy's real-life voice actress, Ashly Burch, who voiced the character in both games. Burch hasn't commented publicly on the demonstration, but has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashlyburch/p/Cw-q5DNx7Yw/" rel="nofollow ">historically supported protections against AI</a> for voice actors in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">As this article was being written, the video was removed from YouTube via a copyright strike filed by Muso TNT Ltd., a company that focuses on content protection and anti-piracy efforts in the entertainment industry. The company recently rebranded, and is now known simply as Muso. It's unclear why the video was taken down or if the footage had been leaked and uploaded by a channel not associated with Sony or Raghoebardajal.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the video has been removed, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge managed to capture a gif</a> of what the demo looked like in action.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is just a glimpse of what is possible," Raghoebardajal said of Aloy's AI demonstration.</p>

Mario has cleaned up an island with a sentient hose, launched himself through the stars alongside Rosalina, and possessed innocent bystanders with the help of a living hat. It’s Mario Day (March 10), so what better time than now to look back at years of <em>Super Mario </em>history and determine the best and worst part of each of our second-favorite Italian plumber’s adventures. (He gets second place because Luigi will always be #1 in our hearts.)</p><p><em>This piece was originally published on April 20, 2023.

It was a triumph on so many levels: unforgettable music, distinctive character design, and the best platforming levels the nascent genre had yet seen, just to name a few. But none of that would have mattered if just running and jumping as Mario through all those treacherous environments and making those Hail-Mary leaps over Bowser at the end of each castle didn’t feel so damn good. Today, of course, playing as Mario doesn’t feel particularly remarkable, but that’s just because Nintendo knocked it out of the park in designing his movement, creating something that immediately felt so intuitive, natural, and amazing that games have been building on it ever since.</p><p><strong>Worst: The Water Levels </strong></p><p>Look, I appreciate that Nintendo wanted to change up the action as you traversed the Mushroom Kingdom, so I can totally forgive the presence of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>.’ water levels. But in a game that was revolutionary in part because of just how good the movement feels, these stages, in which you sluggishly try to avoid swimming straight into a slow-moving Blooper or Cheep Cheep, really deflate the momentum. Swimming stages have continued to be a staple of Mario’s adventures, of course, but Nintendo would tweak the movement to make them less of a drag. By <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, you already felt like you had more control underwater, and if you scored one of those snazzy frog suits, you were really in business.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353">Fans Think Jack Black’s Bowser May Have Rickrolled Us All With ‘Peaches’ Song</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The Four Playable Characters</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Mario had to share the spotlight for the first time in this oddball sequel, and the distinctive abilities of each of his playable companions added a lot to the fun. Toad’s strength and speed and Peach’s float are cool, of course, but my favorite has always been Luigi with his floaty jump and its adorable animation. That’s my Mario brother right there! Notably, this is the first time that Luigi was depicted as taller and skinnier than his brother, rather than simply being a palette swap like he was in <em>Mario Bros.</em>,<em> Super Mario Bros.</em>, and the Japanese version of <em>Super Mario Bros. 2.</em></p><p><strong>Worst: Sub-space </strong></p><p><em>SMB2 </em>has this thing called Sub-space, a dark alternate dimension that you access with the potions you occasionally find. If you happen to enter at the right spot, you’ll score a mushroom for your trouble, but unless you’ve previously memorized where those lucky spots are, you’ll likely waste a potion and come up empty. Secrets and discovery are a great part of <em>Mario</em> games and have been ever since we first had our mind blown by warp zones in the original, but this trial-and-error method of hunting down helpful items wasn’t fun or rewarding.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-nintendo-box-office-jack-black-1850343976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-nintendo-box-office-jack-black-1850343976"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Expected To Pass $1 Billion, Biggest Movie Release This Year</a></span></p></div><div><div><p><strong>Best: Giant Land</strong></p><p>Like the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, this sequel is such a work of genius, a product of the creative team firing on all cylinders, that it’s extremely difficult to point to one thing as the stand-out feature. But if there’s one aspect that’s particularly indicative of the game’s excellence for me, it’s Giant Land, the game’s fourth world, in which everything is super-sized: huge goombas, koopas, blocks, and piranha plants totally shake up your sense of scale. But again, it’s not really Giant Land in isolation that makes <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>so great. It’s just one instance of the inventiveness with which the creative team approached making this game, with each of its realms feeling like a distinctively different step of your epic journey into the heart of Bowser’s territory.</p></div><p><strong>Worst: All those autoscrollers</strong></p><p>Bowser’s airships have a real sense of drama to them. They suggest that Bowser isn’t some flailing, impotent baddie and that he’s got real military might, an empire at his disposal. But the way in which the screen scrolls at its own pace through these stages, often more slowly than you might want to yourself, feels constraining in a game that, like the original, is at its best when you’re enjoying remarkable freedom of movement. And then, just as you’re approaching the game’s climax, you’re hit with several more autoscrollers in Bowser’s world, as you face his tank fleet, his navy, his flotilla of little airships, and then another group of tanks before finally entering the challenging final castle. I appreciate the effort to make Bowser feel formidable, but these stages needlessly prevent you from speeding through, making them both a late-game drag and the bane of speedrunners everywhere.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-pratt-super-mario-bros-movie-voice-soprano-jersey-1850319120&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-pratt-super-mario-bros-movie-voice-soprano-jersey-1850319120">Chris Pratt’s OG Voice In <em>The Super Mario Bros.

He rules because he can just eat enemies Mario would have to stomp or throw a well-timed fireball at. Then, when he eats certain koopa shells, he gets powers like flight, earthquake stomps, and three-way fireballs. We love a multi-talented king, and he deserves to be the star of his own game. Which he was in the next one.</p><p><strong>Worst: Lost some flavor</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario World</em> portended Nintendo’s general approach to sequels on its new, 16-bit system: refine, refine, and refine some more. This resulted in countless memorable classics, but was not without drawbacks. One reason some people prefer <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> over its sequel is that <em>Super Mario World</em> filed off so many rough edges it may have lost some of its “flavor.” The movement physics feel less weighty, the various lands’ themes are a bit mundane and don’t do much to inform the level designs (what makes a level design…chocolate?), and overall the game is just too easy.

Movie</em></a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Throwing eggs at shit</strong></p><p>As the title suggests, the star of <em>Yoshi’s Island </em>is none other than the green dino himself. Because Yoshi isn’t playing second fiddle to Mario, the second <em>Super Mario World </em>game builds around him, and he gets a whole new set of abilities he didn’t have before. This includes being able to change enemies into eggs, which follow you in a single-file line until you decide to hurl them. This factors into combat, puzzle solving, and coin collection as you throw your spawn into places you can’t reach. Who among us doesn’t want to throw eggs at our enemies without consequence?</p><p><strong>Worst: Saving that damn baby</strong></p><p>In <em>Yoshi’s Island</em>, our egg-wielding hero is tasked with delivering baby Mario across the Mushroom Kingdom. Every time you’re hit by an enemy, the baby will float away in a bubble, along with all his hopes and dreams of becoming a moderately successful plumber in adulthood. So every time you get hit by a stray koopa shell, you have to chase after Mario before he floats too far away. Sure, it’s better than dying in one hit, but then the baby starts crying up a racket and you start to doubt the life decisions that led to this dangerous babysitting gig. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-64-bowsers-castle-speedrun-skip-world-record-1850313563&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-64-bowsers-castle-speedrun-skip-world-record-1850313563"><em>Mario Kart </em>Players Land Groundbreaking Trick After 27 Years</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The jump to 3D was a cultural reset</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario 64</em>’s transition from 2D sidescroller to 3D platformer was a capital-M Moment for video games. Nowadays we rarely see many consoles have a “killer app” that sells you on everything a system is about, but <em>Super Mario 64</em> did just that in 1996 when it launched alongside the Nintendo 64. It proved popular 2D games like the <em>Super Mario </em>series could exist in 3D spaces and transcend previous technical limitations. Though the Nintendo 64 conceded market dominance to the original PlayStation by the end of its lifecycle, the system still stands tall as a symbol of Nintendo’s ability to adapt old structures into new ideas and <em>Super Mario 64</em> is a key part to that.</p><p><strong>Worst: But by today’s standards, it can feel pretty rough</strong></p><p>But like some influential games, <em>Super Mario 64 </em>does feel a bit sluggish compared to everything it helped pave the way for. Even by 1996 standards the N64 juggernaut has a troublesome camera, and Mario doesn’t move with a lot of the same precision he does now, though a lot of that could be attributed to the system’s controller, which was the company’s first foray into analog stick control. A lot of these issues were improved upon in the <em>Super Mario 64 DS </em>remake, which served as a technical showcase for that handheld the same way the original did for N64, but this is the way of things when something truly special is iterated on. Take it easy, old timer, the future games will take it from here.</p><p><strong>Watch More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-truff-collectible-pack-hot-sauce-1850320046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-truff-collectible-pack-hot-sauce-1850320046">We Taste-Tested The Super Mario Bros.

That’s already more hardcore than anything his father’s ever pulled off. He’s also super cute, a talented artist, and a villain in his own right. And meta aside, he’s fun as hell to play in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. Thank you <em>Sunshine </em>for bringing this good boy into the world.</p><p><strong>Worst: Needed more TLC</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> felt strangely unpolished for a new <em>Super Mario</em> game. There are lots of glitches, random difficulty spikes, and just a surprising number of rough edges in general. Even the F.L.U.D.D. jetpack system is a little clunky at times. One bit that really symbolizes <em>Sunshine</em>’s inchoateness is its infamous pachinko level, in which Mario’s launched into a giant pachinko machine to gather red coins without falling to his death out of the bottom. Sounds fun! And it could’ve been with more iteration, but the level’s unreliable, quarrelsome physics and unavoidable-feeling deaths remind us that even Nintendo has to work really hard to make these games feel as effortlessly perfect as they often do.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Feels Like It Was Designed In A Lab</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Revitalized the series’ 2D rollout</strong></p><p>When the first <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>game launched in 2006, the series hadn’t seen a new 2D side-scroller since <em>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island</em>, and you didn’t even play as Mario in that one. The “New” in the <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>. title positioned it as a resurgence of the classic <em>Mario </em>formula, which came as a welcome surprise because people were missing that style of game by then. In the years since, “New Super Mario Bros.”<em> </em>has become the default branding for games of this style.</p><p>It’s now been several years since we’ve had a new <em>Mario </em>side-scroller. We have all these questions about a possible 3D game after <em>Odyssey</em>, but it’s been 11 years since <em>New Super Mario Bros. U</em>. So maybe it’s also time we got a new <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>.</p><p><strong>Worst: They all kinda blend together</strong></p><p>While each <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>game has distinguishing factors, like <em>New Super Mario Bros. U</em>’s Boost Mode that lets someone use the Wii U GamePad to interact with the environment, the series broadly lacks the same innovation we see in 3D <em>Mario </em>games. They’re solid, clearly meant to be evocative of classic game design, and can be fun to play with friends. But there’s a reason the <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>. games aren’t talked about with the same breathless fervor of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> or <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>. They’re fine! They’re good! But that’s all they really are. Hopefully that changes somewhere down the line and we can see side-scrolling <em>Mario</em> games innovate in the way they did before.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bowser-jack-black-peaches-streaming-mario-bros-movie-1850307871&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-jack-black-peaches-streaming-mario-bros-movie-1850307871"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Makes Bowser Kinda Pathetic, And It’s Great</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The level design</strong></p><p>Because <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>takes place in space with Mario jumping and running around different tiny planets, Nintendo was able to play with level design in a way that felt truly special a decade removed from <em>Super Mario 64</em>. On top of some excellent Mario platforming, <em>Galaxy </em>brought new layers to getting around that gave both Nintendo and players new space to play in. Now, rather than just considering “can I make this jump,” there are scenarios in which the gravitational pull of a small planet creates some really clever design moments. It might not have had the same cultural impact as <em>Super Mario 64</em>, but <em>Galaxy</em> was still a pretty innovative spin on the formula.</p><p><strong>Worst: The Wii Remote waggle</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>is a game I sometimes have trouble finding fault in, and even this point I don’t have too much of an issue with it because it’s such a small thing in an otherwise stellar game. The Wii’s motion controls can either feel baked into a game’s core, or bolted onto it out of obligation, and <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>’s definite feels like the latter. The Wii Remote is used to gather items by pointing at them and is utilized in some levels to deal with obstacles. The motion controls do ultimately feel unnecessary, but that didn’t stop Nintendo from trying to emulate them in the Switch port.</p><p><strong>Watch More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-little-italy-nintendo-1850305248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-little-italy-nintendo-1850305248">Actual Italians Tell Us What They Think About <em>Super Mario</em></a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Four-player co-op</strong></p><p>Between <em>Mario Party </em>and <em>Mario Kart</em>, the series has never been lacking in multiplayer experiences, but there hadn’t been one in a 3D platformer before <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> hit the Wii U in 2013. Up to four players can band together as Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad to jump through some exceptionally polished <em>Super Mario </em>levels. It captures the chaos of <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em>’s co-op design in a 3D framework. It’s a blast…</p><p><strong>Worst: Four-player co-op:</strong></p><p>…but it’s also a nightmare. Have you ever been minding your own business navigating a level only for one of your co-op partners to pick you up and throw you off a ledge?

Movie</em> Fans Knock Seth Rogen For Barely Trying</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: “Jump Up Super Star!”</strong></p><p>Yes, yes, <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>is a joyful platformer with a lot of excellent game design to back up its hype. But when we talk about the best part of the Switch game, it’s clearly the song “Jump Up Super Star!” Featuring Pauline’s soaring vocals (as portrayed by Kate Higgins), the jazzy track serves as the backdrop for one of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>’s<em> </em>best levels. It’s a swinging certified banger that perfectly encapsulates the joy of <em>Super Mario </em>games with a catchy hook and a ton of swagger. Sucks that Nintendo won’t put it on streaming services.</p><p><strong>Worst: The moral conundrum of possessing the innocent</strong></p><p>One of the main conceits of <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>is that Mario has a living hat companion named Cappy. Throwing the hat onto certain enemies, objects, and even human beings allows Mario to make them do his bidding. Sure, the game doesn’t sit with the implications of that very long, but you do. A wise man once asked in a since-deleted tweet what would happen if Mario were to throw his hat onto the head of a pregnant person. Does the plumber control not only the parent, but the unborn child, as well? I saw that question asked six years ago and have not been able to look at Cappy the same way since. And now, neither will you. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-super-mario-bros-best-ranked-odyssey-1850286446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-super-mario-bros-best-ranked-odyssey-1850286446">Every <em>Super Mario</em> Game Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The Wonder Flower</strong></p><p>Most levels in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>have multiple paths to the ending thanks to the Wonder Flower. This new power-up triggers a Wonder Effect, which shifts the level entirely in varied and unpredictable ways. In one stage, it might conjure bubbles from the ground that can send Mario and friends bouncing above (or, if you’re not careful, into) hazards, sparing you the need to arduously trek through the environment, while in the next, it may turn the stage into an auto-scrolling musical. Some can make you feel like you’re in a whole new level entirely, like one that launches Mario into space, allowing you to float through zero gravity over the original terrain. You never know quite what you’re going to get, and seeking them out makes each level worth replaying.</p><p><strong>Worst: Repetitive bosses</strong></p><p><br>It’s nothing new for a <em>Mario </em>game to make you face the same boss or bosses multiple times throughout your journey; in fact, this trend dates back to the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>.However, it sticks out a bit more in <em>Wonder </em>when mechanics like the Wonder Flower are constantly shaking things up. You fight Bowser Jr. four times in the main quest and while Mario’s strategy changes depending on what power-ups you have at your disposal, the little koopa’s doing the same withdraw-and-spin maneuver throughout. Different villains sprout up in between those encounters, but <em>Wonder</em>’s boss runs can feel monotonous when the same angry kid keeps popping up. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, this is a <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair, bringing one of the most iconic cartoon characters in the world to the popular card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://collider.com/spongebob-magic-the-gathering-special-secret-lair-images/" rel="nofollow">Collider</a>, the Spongebob Secret Lair will be broken up into three different drops. Each of these drops will be available for purchase on March 24 in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $ 39.99) bundles respectively.</p>

These cards are reimaginings of classic Magic: The Gathering cards. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Jodah, the Unifier</em> as "Spongebob Squarepants"</li>
	<li>Charix, the Raging Isle as "Mr. Krabs, Penny Pincher"</li>
	<li><em>Skrelv, Defector Mite</em> as "Plankton, Tiny Tyrant"</li>
	<li><em>Granzilaxx, Illithid Scholar</em> as "Squidward, Sarcastic Snob"</li>
	<li><em>Toxril, The Corrosive</em> as "Gary, The Snail"</li>
	<li><em>Barktooth Warbeard</em> as "Patrick Star"</li>
	<li><em>Toski, Bearer of Secrets</em> as "Sandy Cheeks, Martial Astronaut"</li>
</ul><p>The reskin choices here are humorous. Gary The Snail as a 7/7 creature that can spawn snail tokens and drop poison tokens is such a jarring departure from the lovable mollusk. Patrick Star is just a 6/5 creature with just the flavor text, "I don't get it..." which is spot on.</p>

We’ll have to wait until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">April 2nd to find out if Nintendo is fixing the issue with the new Switch 2</a>, but as iFixit discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjGaEMXa3mQ">during a teardown of the Alarmo alarm clock</a>, the company is already embracing more reliable Hall effect sensors in at least one of its devices.</p></div><p>Unlike disassembling most modern smartphones, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108554/happy-mario-day-ifixit-adafruit-explore-what-makes-the-nintendo-alarm-clock-tick">iFixit’s teardown of Nintendo’s Alarmo</a> appears to be relatively painless.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass.1130499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest season of Rocket League is on the horizon, as announced in a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-18-springs-forth-futura-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a>, and is set to begin on March 14 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 4 PM GMT. There are a lot of new changes coming with this approaching season, with a focus on a futuristic theme in the Futura Garden Arena, as well as other high-tech items that you can get to customize your car.</p>
<p>With a new season comes a new season pass, where you will automatically unlock the Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack Car Body. If you purchase the Rocket Pass, you'll also be able to obtain the Azura Car Body, Space Tower Antenna, Spaceship Topper, and Waypoint Trail. Those who log in during Season 18 will also unlock the Future Fashion Banner.</p>
<p>One of the major changes in this new Rocket League season is the new mutators that will be available to use in Exhibition Mode and Private Matches. Below is the full list of mutators that you'll be able to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumps - From a double jump to an octuple jump, or no jumps allowed at all, the decision is yours.</li>
<li>Number of Balls - you can choose to have one, two, four, or six balls in play.</li>
<li>Ball Gravity - Options include low, high, super, and default gravitational pull.</li>
<li>Dodge Timer - Change the dodge timer.</li>
<li>Possession Score - Players can earn points by keeping possession of the ball.</li>
<li>Normal Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each goal.</li>
<li>Aerial Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each successful airborne goal.</li>
<li>Assist Score - Players can earn up to three points for each assist.</li>
<li>Enforce Territories: This mutator enables the Split Shot Wall, which dives teams across each half of the field. Those that touch the ground of the opponents' side of the field will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-16-out-now-adds-improved-post-demolition-camera/">demolished</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever been in an intense Rocket League match and thought you scored a goal, but you were off by just a hair, a new ping sound will echo throughout the arena. This will happen if the ball hits the crossbar or goal posts to ensure that you don't lose momentum and start celebrating too early.</p>
<p>To make sure that the game is being kept safe for the decent people of Rocket League, player reporting is now being expanded to include voice reporting. This means that as well as being able to block, mute, and report other players, you'll now be able to submit audio evidence if you suspect that they are violating the Community Rules. For those concerned about what that means for them, there is a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/voice-reporting-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed FAQ</a> that explains everything you need to know.</p>

It claims the new device will be an Xbox-branded PC gaming handheld from an existing OEM and that it’s codenamed “Keenan.” It’ll have an official Xbox guide button and is currently planned to launch later this year, with the successor to the Xbox Series X/S generation of consoles greenlit for a planned launch as early as 2027. Notably, it sounds like it’ll be a single next-gen console, with the current Series S potentially subsumed by the handheld if it’s successful. <br></p><p>The report also claims that the next generation of controllers might feature “direct-to-cloud connectivity.” It’s believed the Microsoft’s work with generative AI and the existing Windows platform for PC will both play a greater role in Xbox’s future as well.

<p>A new leak has shown that Sony is working on AI-driven characters from some of its PlayStation franchises. </p>



<p>The leak, which was originally shown to The Verge but is now public shows Horizon Forbidden West’s Aloy talking and responding to someone asking her questions. You can watch the footage below:</p>



<figure><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-RJ7O9Tqf4&amp;
</p></figure>



<p>As expected, the quality of the AI-powered character isn’t no where near the quality of having a team of developers working on it. But, as that hasn’t stopped Sony from hyping it up in a presumably behind-the-scenes presentation that went public.</p>



<p>As said by director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, the footage is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>While it’s clearly not up to par with traditional development methods, Sony’s exploration into AI is likely going to turn a lot of heads in the industry, especially for developers. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024&nbsp;survey&nbsp;said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision faced criticism for its blatant use of AI imagery for its marketing</a> (and bad ones at that), with the community criticising the lack of effort. </p>



<p>It’s clear that AI isn’t going to go away and there’s still important conversations to be had in its role in game development, but some of the current use cases are becoming very questionable, especially when it comes to video games and the art form.</p>



<p>What do you think of AI and its use in video games? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is working on a prototype AI-powered version of at least one its PlayStation game characters. An anonymous tipster has shared an internal video from Sony’s PlayStation group with <em>The Verge</em> that demonstrates an AI-powered version of Aloy from <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>. After we published this story, the video was pulled from YouTube due to a copyright claim <a href="https://www.muso.com/">from Muso</a>, a copyrights enforcement company which advertises Sony Interactive Entertainment (aka PlayStation) as a client.</p><p>The video is narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment who works on video game technology, AI, computer vision, and face technology for Sony’s PlayStation Studios Advanced Technology Group. We watched Raghoebardajal demonstrate an AI-powered version of Aloy that can hold a conversation with a player through voice prompts during gameplay.</p><p>Aloy could be seen responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements, both in a demo setting and within the full <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> game. Raghoebardajal makes it clear this is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate the technology internally at Sony.</p><p>The technology demo uses OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text, and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations and decision making. Sony’s has its own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system that it uses for speech generation, according to Raghoebardajal, and audio to face animation is powered by Sony’s own Mockingbird technology.</p><p>While the demo is seen running on PC, Sony has also experimented with running parts of this technology directly on PS5 consoles with “little overhead,” according to Raghoebardajal. Sony first demonstrated this internally a year ago, before showing a more advanced version behind closed doors at its Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) in Tokyo in November.</p><p>“This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” says Raghoebardajal. This tech demo doesn’t answer the more obvious questions over whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when you’re supposed to be playing as her in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the impact such a technology could have on voice actors and game developers.</p><p><em><sub>The video above was pulled after The Verge published our story; you can see an animation above.</sub></em></p><p>Nvidia has been working on its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">similar technology for AI-powered NPCs</a> in games, where you speak freely to video game characters. Ace, as Nvidia calls it, has been demonstrated several times throughout 2024, and the GPU maker has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105681/nvidia-ai-ace-video-game-character-npc-covert-protocol">worked with Inworld AI</a> to create <em>Covert Protocol</em>, a playable tech demo of Nvidia’s AI game technology.</p><p>Microsoft has also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948454/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-developer-tools-inworld-partnership">partnering closely with Inworld AI</a> to eventually bring AI characters to Xbox, allowing game developers to use generative AI characters, storylines, and more. Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">created its own Muse AI model that generates gameplay</a>, designed initially for game developers to create a game environment for prototyping and ideating.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear among game developers and studios about how AI could impact the creative process of making video games, particularly when so many layoffs are impacting the gaming industry. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them.</p><p>Sony’s experiments with AI-powered PlayStation characters are bound to generate more conversation around the role of AI in video game creation, just ahead of GDC next week in San Francisco. We reached out multiple times to Sony for a comment on this leaked internal video, but the company didn’t respond. We’ve asked again to confirm whether Sony pulled the video, and if it has further comment.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 10th: </strong>Added that the video has been pulled by a copyright agent which counts PlayStation as a client.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If the internet has taught me anything, its that Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 are two games folks simply cannot get enough of, myself included. Fortunately, a newly-released, fan-made mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Village</a>, combines the two in a pretty spectacular way. With the Baldur's Village mod, Stardew players can add 20+ characters, six new locations, new shops, new items, and new events, all inspired by Baldur's Gate 3, to the popular farming sim.</p><p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," the mods description reads. "You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent."</p><p>After venturing up north, players will be greeted by an entirely new area occupied by several familiar faces, including Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, and everyone's favorite, blood-sucking aristocrat, Astarion. Currently, Astarion is the only new neighbor players will be able to romance, as he is the only one the team has finished designing heart events and gift preferences for. However, the team has confirmed that its next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline, followed by expanding world-building background stories and gameplay features.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4456696,1300-4456697,1300-4456698,1300-4456699,1300-4456700,1300-4456701,1300-4456702,1300-4456703,1300-4456704,1300-4456705" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"></figure><p>In order to get the Baldur's Village mod up and running, players will also need to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Modding API</a> (SMAPI), the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Valley Content Patcher</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portraiture mod</a>, all of which can be downloaded for free over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. Players already using Stardew Valley mods might already have these downloaded, as several of the game's most popular mods require SMAPI and the Content Patcher to run. Once the mod is installed, players need not worry about starting a new game to experience the Baldur's Gate bliss--the mod should seamlessly integrate the new content into existing save files.</p><p>Despite launching less than 24 hours ago, Baldur's Village is already proving to be a very popular mod, with nearly 90,000 views and 12,000 total downloads as of writing. Considering mods have played a pivotal role in keeping both Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 fresh and exciting for repeat players, the success of Baldur's Village is exciting yet hardly surprising.</p><p>Interested in more mod recommendations from GameSpot?

                <p>Directors Neil Druckmann and Alex Garland sat down for a wide-ranging and fascinating chat recently where they discussed their professional careers. There is some overlap, of course, as Druckmann's The Last of Us franchise and Garland's 28 Days Later are themed around a virus that leads to epic societal collapse. In the discussion, Garland said he's sure The Last of Us (2013) is better than 28 Days Later (2002), at least in terms of the writing.</p><p>"The Last of Us is better than 28 Days Later, or at least the writing is. I know what 28 Days is. I know what I did. I know what the process was," he said in an <a href="https://youtu.be/iJUab499PVA?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an interview for Sony</a>. "The thing about The Last of Us was I was like, 'Oh this is like so much more sophisticated and moving.' I'm not dissing 28 Days Later. It's a nice part of my life.

            <p>
Microsoft is reportedly aiming to release its next-gen Xbox Series X/S successor in 2027, with a much-rumoured handheld Xbox arriving later this year.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">according to Windows Central</a>, which reports an Xbox Series X/S successor has been greenlit "all the way up to [Microsoft] CEO Satya Nadella" and is now "fully in production". The publication doesn't have much to share in the way of specifics, but it claims the new console is a "premium successor to the powerful Xbox Series X", and is currently slated for a 2027 release.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has, of course, already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed it's working on an Series X/S successor</a>, with Xbox president Sarah Bond last year saying - amid fan fears the company may be looking to abandon the console market - it was "invested in [its] next-generation road map" and "focused on... delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."

While 2027 is obviously still some considerable way off, Windows Central says Microsoft has other Xbox hardware plans due to reach fruition much sooner. The company is reportedly currently working alongside an unspecified "PC gaming OEM" to launch an Xbox-branded gaming handheld later this year. It's claimed the device is being developed under the codename Keenan, and will - according to Windows Central's sources - look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
The idea of an Xbox handheld is nothing new. Back in 2017, Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> revealed Microsoft had "roughly designed an Xbox handheld" in the past. However, he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">repeatedly returned to the subject over the last year</a>, fuelling speculation the project had been revived. When questioned about a potential Xbox handheld last November, Spencer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">suggested any such devices would still be a few years away</a>, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2 looming</a>, and reports suggesting Sony is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">working on its own handheld device in the form of portable PS5</a>, it might be Microsoft felt the need to accelerate its plans.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, Windows Central claims Microsoft is <em>also</em> internally developing its own Xbox gaming handheld, separate from this year's partner machine, which is due to release alongside its Series X/S successor and "several new controller options" in 2027.
</p>
<p>
All this comes after a 2024 that saw Microsoft's continued dedication to the console market repeatedly questioned, particularly following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">bring select first-party Xbox games to other platforms</a>. And while that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">multiplatform strategy is accelerating in 2025</a>, the company has been keen to reiterate its commitment to the Xbox hardware business - last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">announcing three new Xbox console variants</a> alongside talk of its next-gen plans.
