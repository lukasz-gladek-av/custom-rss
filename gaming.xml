		<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, and it’s proved to me that most people just want to get along. Everyone is helping you out, almost no one is shooting at you who isn’t a robot, and you can party up with other players and just have a lovely time (while you hide and skulk from increasingly difficult robots). Its presentation is also pitch-perfect, and it’s so far been something of a revelation. Unfortunately, this now means I’m no longer playing Overwatch, but I have snuck in some Lumines: Arise, Plants Vs Zombies and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which has given me plenty of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has just started on Ghost of Yotei. It’s early days mind you, as he tells us, “I’m only an hour in, so it’s still super fresh, but I’m enjoying it so far!” But for <strong>Aran</strong> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26</a>? The verdict is well and truly in, as he says it “needs lots of improvements,” There was also some Umami for review.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> is somewhat lost with what to play right now. He tells us, “I am wandering lost between games, unable to find anything I really want to sink my teeth in while teetering on the edge of buying Final Fantasy XVI, FF7 Remake 2: The Second Coming Of Shoulder Shimmying, Mordor Mark 2: This Time It’s Even More Morally Grey, and a few roguelikes. Also, I’m playing Arc Raiders, which is fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> is another who’s on the Arc Raiders train. He says, “I love the music and setting and it’s genuinely a new experience in that most people aren’t out to kill you, in fact I’ve never been shot by a player. Everyone seems to be working together and helping each other out which is probably not what the devs wanted, but given how the real world is, it’s really quite comforting.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished PowerWash Simulator and started Tormented Souls 2 but he’s been away at a family wedding and so that’s slowed him down from his usual tear, opting instead for the new Garth Merenghi book. Meanwhile, Ade got a bit bored of Ninja Gaiden 4. He says, “It was finally getting to play as Ryu, only to be stuck going through all the same levels and fighting the same bosses that I’d already just beaten whilst playing as generic emo Ninja guy that polished me off. Felt like a very cheap way of padding out the game’s length. Overall, a bit disappointed with Ninja Gaiden 4, especially considering the pedigree of the developers.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Sweet Surrender for review, as well as Deep Rock Galactic Survivor and Fights in Tight Spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been squealing at baby dinosaurs in Jurassic World Evolution 3 and shrieking at legs jumping out at her from under tables in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. She says, “It’s quite the combination, but when I’m exhausted trying to get 5 stars by getting all of my dinosaurs up to 100% comfort (why are the Ankylosaurus so damn picky?!) I switch over. Then when I’m tired of constantly walking around yet another grimy looking apartment block I switch back!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> is making slow but steady progress with Ghost of Yotei. He tells us, “Instead of blitzing the main story missions, I’m finding too many distractions! The fact that they don’t feel obtrusive or repetitive is always the true sign of a good open world game. I’ll definitely be going for the platinum trophy.” He continues, “I also played more Battlefield 6 which is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since Bad Company 2. Initially I started as a Support main though I’ve since warmed towards the Engineer, having racked up quite the kill count with my cheeky anti-tank mines.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> had a few matches in Battlefield 6, though it’s much more casual time filler than it was around launch for him. He’s also had another hands on session with Kirby Air Riders, ahead of this weekend’s online tests, and you’ll see his thoughts on this rather soon!</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer miHoYo, the studio behind the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/genshin-impact-gacha-highjacked/">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, is working on a new game that will be much different from anything it has released so far.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">As spotted on the&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank">ResetERA forums</a>, the developer is currently working on a fantasy open-world MMO featuring realistic graphics, PvP, an AI-stimulated ecological system, large-scale boss fights, and advanced AI-powered NPCs.</span> These new features will mark a significant shift in gameplay terms, and a considerable step forward from the games the developer is currently supporting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The teaser shared by miHoYo as part of a recruitment effort for their Unreal Engine 5-powered new game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides sharing the first information on the yet to be named game, miHoYo released a video providing a very early look at the visual style the studio is aiming for has also been released, and it looks more technically advanced than anything it has done to date. Hopefully, the developer will also be able to address the known performance issues that plague games powered by the engine to deliver an experience that can be on par with its previous games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming project from miHoYo, alongside other open-world games such as Where Winds Meet, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">launching globally on November 14</a>, seems to signal a radical change for free-to-play open world games, which are doing away with colorful and stylized visuals to offer experiences that are edging ever closer to the PC and console premium AAA experiences. As such, it will be fascinating to see how players will react to these experiences, and if the realistic visuals and advanced AI-powered features will make these games as big a hit as Genshin Impact.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked.1346821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you didn’t know, EA announced a while back that it was working on an open-world addition to the EA FC franchise. Recently, a new FC playtest has been underway, and it’s been revealed that it’s indeed for the open-world content. Gameplay footage has leaked and been shared already.</p>



<p>All publicity is good publicity. Yes, the EA FC open-world game mode playtest is supposed to be private, but the community is desperate to see what it looks like, what you can do, and how it plays. Internal documents have already revealed the expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC open-world mode release window</a>, and there’s gameplay to keep you ticking over.</p>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-leaks-early">EA FC Open World Gameplay Leaks Early</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even Cole agrees the footage is cold. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were rumors that an EA FC open-world mode would be akin to NBA 2K’s open-world hub. It would include fun mini-games and ways to interact with other players.</p>



<p>This seems to be the case. You can check out leaked videos and gameplay, especially through <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-fc-open-world-map-has-already-leaked-during-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ, as they first reported that gameplay had leaked</a>. You can also find snippets across all forms of social media.</p>



<p>Check out the initial media here, but be warned, there’s every chance EA will have the content removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players can dip in and out of several mini-games, watch from the sidelines if needed, walk around, and talk to other users, and the initial maps look quite sizable. Rumor has it that there <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, a quick search on X, TikTok, and YouTube is bound to give you the footage you’re looking for. It’s certainly out there. EA is presumably doing its best to clamp down on leaked clips and have the gameplay footage removed. You might need to be quicker than Mbappe to see certain videos!</p>



<p>Does an open-world EA FC gameplay mode interest you? Should EA be concentrating its efforts on other areas of EA FC, such as Career Mode or Clubs? The place to dissect all of this and more is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which continues to grow each day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The zombie horde returns to face off against players in Black Ops 7, and, as has become customary in the mode, there are a wealth of Perk-A-Colas available that assist in the battle to fend off the undead army.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches worldwide on November 14</a>, bringing a new campaign, complete with four-player co-op, multiplayer action, and Zombies, the latter of which will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded further with the addition of new maps</a> throughout the game’s lifespan.</p>



<p>Perk-A-Colas have long been a core part of the mechanics of Zombies in the Call of Duty franchise, and we’ve got all the details on what will be available to save up for in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-perk-a-colas">All Black Ops 7 Perk-A-Colas</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collect them all. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Zombies launches</strong> <strong>with 12 Perk-A-Colas available, 11 of which are returning to the franchise, with the other being brand new.</strong></p>



<p>Wisp Tea is the only new Perk-A-Cola added to Black Ops 7 Zombies at launch, with a unique benefit that summons a companion wisp after killing zombies. All other Perk-a-Colas in the game have featured in the franchise in the past, with the majority having been available in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Zombies will be regularly updated throughout the game’s lifespan, however, so new and returning Perk-A-Colas could come later down the line with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the available Perk-A-Colas at launch in Black Ops 7 Zombies, along with a description of the bonus they provide.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest stories in gaming this year is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">EA's pending $55 billion deal to be sold to a investor consortium</a> led by Saudi Arabia. The sale could have ripple effects across the wider industry, and now Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has weighed in with his thoughts about it all.</p><p>Speaking during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>, Zelnick said he is "not sure" about how the competitive market could shake out if EA does indeed go private. This would leave Take-Two the last publicly traded company--of a certain scale--in the American video game business, an analyst pointed out.</p><p>Some have theorized EA going private could be a boon for Take-Two, but Zelnick isn't keen to assume that will be the case.</p><p>"We're always running scared around here. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success. And I do think we're in a terrific position. We're performing much better than expected economically, and that's because we're performing better than expected creatively, and that's always our story around here," he said. "And if we can maintain that, then we have a wonderful future ahead of us. It is true that at year-end, we're really very under-leveraged."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Zelnick said it may be true that EA going private could give Take-Two "a bit of room from a competitive point of view," but that isn't clear at this point.</p><p>"We wish our competitors well. A good business is well served by having powerful players, not just one powerful player. So, it's possible that the competitor landscape shifts a bit; it's also possible nothing changes at all. Either way, we have to do our job, which is make the very best entertainment on earth."</p><p>EA's sale to Saudi Arabia's PIF, Affinity Partners, and Silver Lake has only been announced; the deal is not done yet and is not expected to close until 2026. </p><p>Take-Two's biggest announcement from the earnings results was that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Rockstar's GTA 6 had been delayed yet again</a>. The game was originally slated to release in Fall 2025 before it was delayed to May 2026 and now it's been pushed to November 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar said.</p><p>Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>

		<p>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu has held a video call with staff outside Japan and announced a “fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization”. Jobs will be cut and those left will be expected to spend more time working in the office. The move is part of a cost-cutting exercise to save 3 billion yen ($19.6 million), although the last attempt at restructuring the company ended up costing the company 9.8 billion&nbsp;yen.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not announced how many people will be let go and said that affected staff will be notified today. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a> are reporting that over 140 people are at risk in the London office, including those working in marketing, QA, and sales.</p>


<p>Alongside this, the company also released a financial statement along with a commentary that stated that they are working with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo on a project “aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies”. Their goal is to “automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027”.</p>
<p>The financial report shows that game sales for the company are down 15% year-on-year but despite this, operating income has increased by 28.8% due to reduced marketing and development costs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/next-bioshock-now-on-great-track-take-franchise-next-level/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-bioshock-is-now-on-a-great-track-to-take-the-franchise-to-the-next-level-says-take-two-ceo.1346785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been twelve and a half years since Irrational Games launched BioShock Infinite, the last installment in the immersive single player first-person shooter franchise. Franchise creator Ken Levine notoriously decided to disband the studio and form the much smaller Ghost Story Games, which is now working on Judas. Levine recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-similar-bioshock-some-ways-radically-different-in-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that Judas shares some similarities with the BioShock franchise, but it is also different in many ways.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Take-Two's publishing label 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2019 that a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber, headquartered in Novato, California, would take stewardship of the BioShock IP. Cloud Chamber had its own fair share of troubles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooting the project in 2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffering a big round of layoffs</a> (affecting around 80 employees) as recently as this August, which delayed the new BioShock to the latter half of 2027, according to credible sources.</p>



<p>The former Studio Head, Kelley Gilmore, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced by industry veteran Rod Fergusson</a>, who previously worked at Epic Games, The Coalition, and Blizzard, among others. Fergusson is known to be well-versed in taking over and focusing a studio's resources toward the successful completion of a game, and that's precisely what's needed here. Indeed, speaking during Take-Two's Q2 2026 earnings call (the same one that announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the delay of GTA VI</a>), CEO Strauss Zelnick said the game is now on a great track to take the franchise to the next level. Here's the quote:</p>



<p><em>We’re very excited that we brought Rod on to lead Cloud Chamber. He is the new head of the BioShock franchise. He’s obviously an incredible industry veteran. He’s got history with the BioShock franchise, specifically with Infinite. He’s also been involved with Gears of War and Diablo. We’re just so grateful that he’s come to work with us at Cloud Chamber. BioShock is a very important franchise for us. It’s one of our biggest franchises. We’re very excited about the release of the next BioShock. We’ve made some changes in the organization. We’re shifting some things around. Right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that’s going to exceed consumers’ expectations. Not much more to update other than the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises.</em></p>



<p>It may take a while, as mentioned above, but franchise fans will be able to tide themselves over with Judas (which is 'coming up', according to Zelnick, and is likely to be ready before the BioShock game) and the BioShock Netflix film adaptation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be directed by The Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence</a> and should begin production after Lawrence finishes shooting the next movie in that franchise (Sunrise on the Reaping).</p>

            <p>I was nosing around for a feelgood story to perk you up after this morning's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">depresso</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-goodbye-to-nic-reuben-chief-librarian-and-rps-staff-writer">news</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announce-mass-layoffs-with-over-100-uk-staff-reportedly-expected-to-be-at-risk">stew</a>. But then I thought: what have you done for me lately? So instead, we're going to write up the release of Diggergun, a life sim platform game about burrowing for lithium, in which you lose a portion of your take-home pay to costs based on real-world current UK tax, national insurance, debt and household expenses. Glorious! That'll teach you to show up here, expecting some kind of escapism.</p><!--more-->
<p>In my defence, it seems possible for Diggergun to become more of a feelgood game if all of the aforesaid realworld statistics improve. But I'm not sure this will ever transform into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wandersong">Wandersong</a>, exactly. One of the first things I did in the Steam demo was develop symptoms of what I assume is lithium poisoning. There may also be supernatural threats ahead: white eyes in the dark, and little green men (self-described, anyway - the visuals are monochrome) who talk of ancient evils below. Is a Balrog worse than the cost-of-living crisis? This we may discover.</p>

<p>As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, you start the game owing a hefty sum to a giant corporation, the operators of a weird Cornish mining operation on the isolated and therefore, unregulated Bal Island. To pay off the debt - or so you're told by your employers - you must jump and gun-dig through a "diverse range of randomly generated mines and intricately hand-designed levels", all of them presented as 2D platters of destructible blocks, gems and hostile critters. It's sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> but with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minit">Minit</a>'s art direction, and each floor is (so far) more of a single-screen puzzle than a procedural ecology.</p><p>You're bound by an energy gauge that decreases for every floor you descend, and punishes you in various ways for overdoing it. You can deposit your lithium load and return to the surface by heading to the exit on each level. Also on the surface: a gloomy town's worth of miners, managers, loansharks and shabby apartments, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tristram">Tristram</a> if it were founded by Weyland-Yutani. There are people here you can bond with to pursue a multiple-ending storyline. I feel like my best friends so far are the toilet and shower in my apartment, which restore a precious point of energy apiece.</p>
<p>Diggergun is the work of solo developer Kabloop, and has an autobiographical underbelly. "I started working on the game three years ago, after a very unpleasant experience working at a video game publisher," the developer told me over email. "Something I didn't expect was that Diggergun's themes about workers rights and the minimum wage have become <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/03/nigel-farage-reform-uk-economic-policy">more relevant today</a> than when I started." </p>
<p>"Whilst things are looking bleak, it's my hope that Diggergun can be a part of a much needed discussion about workers rights, and our duty of care to one another," the dev went on. "As opposed to ranting at people, my game attempts to highlight its themes through its emergent gameplay. For example, if the player does their job correctly they're rewarded with more work... something I'm sure we can all relate to."</p>
<p>If all this sounds <em>too</em> relatable, know that the game has some uncomplicated upsides. The setting is pleasantly mysterious and there's some wonderful audio design. Signboard text unfurls with a warble of Morse code, and your character makes a digital plinky-plonk noise when they walk that I found immediately endearing. Still, none of that's going to pay the rent. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968180/DIGGERGUN/">Find out more on Steam.</a></p>

              <p>Have you heard the whispers? According to my sources, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> has been delayed again.</a>&nbsp;It’s weird, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">a guy&nbsp;<em>promised</em> me this wouldn’t happen</a>. Anyway, PlayStation Plus subscribers can somewhat console themselves with word from the extremely reliable leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">over at&nbsp;<em>Dealabs</em></a>:&nbsp;<em>GTA V</em> seems to be making its way back onto PS Plus yet again later this month.</p> <p>This is the third appearance of <em>GTA V</em> on PS Plus, last disappearing from the service in May this year. It seems likely that had the game met its original release plan of fall 2025, it would not have returned, so as to push all focus onto <em>GTA</em> VI without a surrogate “free” earlier entry for people to play instead. Then the game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799">surprise-delayed</a> in May this year to May 2026, and none of that made much sense any more. So, then with the intention of seeing the game come out in May 2026, Rockstar seemingly made plans with Sony to return it to the sub for a bit.</p>

 <p>Except, now that’s gone wrong too! However, what seems definitely impossible is that this news of <em>GTA V</em>‘s return to PS Plus has anything to do with last night’s shock announcement—such things would have been organized long ago. Instead it’s perhaps a rather timely coincidence for Rockstar, given it gives the appearance of saying, “Look, play this one for ‘free’ for a bit to cushion the blow.”</p>

 <p><em>GTA V</em> <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/03/grand-theft-auto-v-game-pass-gtav-enhanced-april-15/">was also added to Microsoft’s Game Pass last year</a>, and has remained their since, rather than following the odd six months on, six months off pattern the game’s had with PlayStation. And even if there had been plans to yoink it from the Xbox subscription some time soon, that’d be a pretty disastrous PR move at this point. So it seems reasonably likely that both PS5 and Xbox players will be able to keep playing for the foreseeable. Although definitely expect it to disappear from both should the game actually manage to come out November 2026, with Rockstar wanting everyone as hungry as possible to spend money on the shiny new game.</p> <p>Or perhaps we’re just six months away from the announcement of the next delay, when&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em> gets slated for May 2027, just in time for it to then get held back again as a PS6 release, and everyone who loved <em>GTA V&nbsp;</em>ages out shortly before the heat death of the universe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advent calendars turn the December countdown into a daily ritual of surprise and anticipation, and LEGO’s Star Wars version delivers on exactly that with a galaxy far, far away twist. This year’s LEGO Star Wars Advent calendar <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5387/">has dropped to an all-time low of $26 on Amazon, slashed from its original $44 price tag</a>.</p>
<p>The calendar is <strong>packed with 24 surprises behind its doors</strong>, and turns each day in December into a mini building adventure that brings iconic droids and characters into your home. LEGO clearly wants to move inventory before Advent begins and that urgency creates an opportunity for anyone planning their holiday celebrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5387/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twenty-Four Days of Galactic Discoveries</h2>
<p>Behind each numbered door waits a Star Wars surprise that builds anticipation throughout the month. You get C-3PO and a Holiday Jawa as minifigures and gives kids immediately recognizable characters to play with right out of the gate. Babu Frik makes an appearance as a LEGO figure, bringing the tiny droidsmith from The Rise of Skywalker into your collection. Five droid figures round out the character lineup including R7-A7, BD-72, a Scrap Battle Droid, BB-8 dressed as a snowman for the holidays, and a Super Battle Droid ready for action.</p>
<p><strong>Eight buildable droids</strong> across several days keep hands busy with construction challenges. Kids will assemble a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, and Buzz Droid, each with different building techniques that develop spatial reasoning skills. Holiday versions of a Medical Droid and Mouse Droid add festive touches to familiar Star Wars machinery. B2EMO from the Andor series joins the roster alongside a Treadwell Droid and Probe Droid, giving fans droids across different eras of Star Wars storytelling.</p>



<p>Of course, the calendar is not limited to characters and droids. Mini builds create Babu Frik’s workshop piece by piece, with a workbench, chair, tool rack, and shelves making an appearance as the days progress. It also includes a box of extra parts, crane, and bucket to enhance the workshop setup for kids to play out the busy work of the droidsmith fixing and upgrading mechanical companions. A Jawa buildable vehicle expands play possibilities, and a Christmas tree brings holiday cheer to the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>With <strong>263 pieces in total</strong>, this calendar allows the building experience to be spread out throughout the month rather than overwhelming kids with one huge construction project. Every day, a manageable build is accomplished, which feels rewarding without hours of focus, perfect for children aged 6 and up who are still developing their LEGO skills.</p>

<p>Players diving into Zombies in Black Ops 7 have a long to-do list to unlock all of the available items, as some of the most powerful pieces of equipment and Field Upgrades are restricted to level unlocks—and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on November 14</a>, equipped with a brand new Zombies adventure to work through from the off, and there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of additional content planned for the future with new maps</a> and more.</p>



<p>Whether you’re an experienced Zombie slayer or are a new recruit in the battle to fend off the undead horde, we’ve got all the details on the Black Ops 7 Zombies level unlocks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-zombies-level-unlocks-listed">All Black Ops 7 Zombies Level Unlocks, Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to get. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is a wide range of level unlocks for Black Ops 7 Zombies, with minimal items and equipment available immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Better gear makes it easier to advance deep into the later rounds in Zombies, so grinding for them is recommended. Some are much more powerful than others and should be immediately topping your wish list.</p>



<p>Unlockables in Black Ops 7 Zombies include Lethal Equipment, Tactical Equipment, Field Upgrades, Gobblegums, Support Items, and Ammo Mods.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the unlocks in Black Ops 7 Zombies listed by level, along with their type and a description.</p>

		<p>Call of Duty games have gradually been increasing in size over the years and now take up a significant chunk of your hard drive.&nbsp; Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not expected to buck the trend, as it is going to land somewhere between 130GB and 166GB on PS5.</p>
<p>The back of the physical box states the game requires 166GB, but a report from PlayStation Game Size, who dig about in the back end of the PSN, reveals that the main game is 96.677 GB, with the co-op campaign adding 15.594 GB and Warzone an additional 19.734 GB. There is no mention of Zombies, which may be part of the main file or an additional download that has yet to be listed.</p>


<p>The Xbox download size has not been revealed, but PC gamers are going to need a minimum of 116GB. By comparison, the rather good Arc Raiders is 16Gb on PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>How is it holding up?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, and our pals over at Digital Foundry have presented their tech verdict on the new title from developer AAA Games Studio.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's pretty decent! With its 40GB+ file size, the game utilises dynamic resolution scaling, with docked mode putting out anything between 720p and 900p, while handheld mode delivers between 468p to 648p. DF states that these resolution targets are generally pretty good considering the effects-heavy gameplay.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's improved specs over its predecessor means its able to render a whole bunch of overlapping effects alongside dozens and dozens of enemies on-screen, all running at 60fps. Meanwhile, enemy complexity is much improved over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, and multiple effects light up the surrounding terrain impressively.</p>
<p>Frame rate, as mentioned, sticks to 60fps for the most part, however DF states you'll "easily" spot moments in which the performance drops slightly. It's nothing egregious, mind you, and you're not really going to get anything below 50fps, so it seems to be a pretty stable game overall.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that if you jump into local co-op mode via split-screen, you're going to be getting 30fps instead of 60. That said, if you have two Switch 2 consoles at hand, or even if you use GameShare, you can play co-op with a much smoother 60fps.</p>
<p>For even more in-depth analysis, be sure to check out Digital Foundry's video and article down below. You might notice that we've not included such articles in our recent DF pieces, and that's because the team has recently joined forces with Hookshot Media to create its own website – huzzah! Congrats to all involved.</p>

            <p>Amid announcing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">delay</a> during their latest earnings call, Take-Two also raised a glass to comparatively less earth-shatteringly huge crime committer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. As it turns out, there's enough of an appetite for more "contained" tales sold at a lower price point than the usual all-singing, all-dancing affairs big publishers keep pushing more and more of their eggs into the baskets of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said the Sicilian sojourn convincingly outperformed expectations, putting to be any questions about the series' future, at least for now. "What we suspected was confirmed," the exec told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. "Which is just...if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result."</p>
<p>While I'm not sure I'd go too over the top in congratulating Take-Two for taking the unprecedented gamble of, er, not having every game be a massive, unwieldy beast which is expected to deliver the GDP of a decently-sized country just to not be a branded a faliure, it's nice to see The Old Country's approach did pay off.</p>
<p>As I said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">my review</a>, it's a path I was glad to see Hangar 13 take, even if in my estimation the short Mafia romp they ended up creating is a bit too by-the-numbers narrative-wise and could maybe have to done more to blend both the old and the new into its pint-sized soup. If you're prepared to accept caveats like those going in, it's well worth picking up for a fun weekend or so of chases in old timey cars and people talking about oaths of omerta.</p><p>I'd certainly not want every game I played to set its sights on only being the sort of thing The Old Country is, but it's important that games like it keep on getting made, because there'll always be a place for them. Here's hoping Take-Two don't turn around and forget that the moment they finish their celebratory wine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another of the corp's summer releases, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, didn't have any beverages cracked open for it. Instead, Zelnick cited it as having faired less well than planned this far, something the company are blaming on the technical issues which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">plagued its PC version early doors</a>. What that in mind, they expect a game that conformtably had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">biggest US launch</a> in its series' history to pick up going forwards. This industry, man.</p>

<p>According to the numbers provided in Take-Two Interactive’s latest earnings release, Red Dead Redemption 2 has become the fourth best-selling game of all time in terms of units sold. </p>



<p>Rockstar Games dominates the gaming industry, a fact widely acknowledged due to the developer’s remarkable portfolio. However, they have outdone themselves this time around by having not one, but two games in the best-selling titles of all time list: Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-has-sold-over-79-million-units-surpassing-mario-kart-8">Red Dead Redemption 2 Has Sold Over 79 Million Units, Surpassing Mario Kart 8</h2>



<p>As revealed during Take-Two’s latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a>, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 79 million units, and the series has sold a total of 106 million units globally. Moreover, analyst data reveals that RDR2 has been the “best-selling title of the past 7 years in the US based on dollar sales.” Additionally, Red Dead Online comes free with every copy of Red Dead Redemption 2, and a standalone online version was also released in 2020.</p>



<p>Mario Kart 8 was previously at the fourth spot for best-selling games of all time (units sold), with the title pushing 78.02 million copies across the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. Now Red Dead Redemption 2 has taken its place, and the only games ahead of it are Wii Sports with 82.9 million units (bundled with Wii U consoles), Grand Theft Auto 5 with over 220 million units sold-in to date, and in the first spot, we have Minecraft with over 350 million sold.</p>



<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-doubted-budget-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with skepticism</a> due to budget and timeline issues. Additionally, GTA 6’s delay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could impact games</a> like Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty.

<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is releasing digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, 2025. </p>



<p>Mario Kart is the franchise that has dominated Nintendo’s consoles in the racing genre for the longest time, with the latest entry to the franchise, Mario Kart World, already nearing 10 million units. However, a new competitor is entering this space, and it will make its grand debut on the platform next month. </p>

Moreover, players who already own the Switch version can purchase the upgrade pack for the latest console. The Switch 2 version of Sonic Racing CrossWorlds will offer players improved graphics resolution and higher frame rates. The release date for the physical version has not been revealed; however, we do know it will use a game card. </p>

<p>Furthermore, suppose players are looking to purchase the the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Season Pass at a discounted price. In that case, they can do so by purchasing both Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Digital Deluxe Edition for Nintendo Switch, which includes the base game, season pass, and upgrade pack. Also, saved data can be transferred from Switch 1 to Switch 2. </p>

The comments have bloomed with sarcasm and sadness alike, with some users feeling GTA6 drift further and further away.</p>
<p>"Crazy how we went from "200 days let's goooo" to "377 days I might hibernate" in one Rockstar tweet" wrote user Entire-Damage9694, noting the drastic shift in sentiment felt on the community hub over a matter of hours.

<p>Others are predicting even further delays, speculating an eventual 2027 release date due to the onslaught of continuous delays GTA6 has suffered.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/07/boulies-master-series-2025-gaming-chair-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/boulies-master-series-2025-gaming-chair-review.1346734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As the end of the year heads into sight, and as my YouTube algorithm seems set on reminding me, gaming chairs are one of the best ways to upgrade your gaming setup. This time around, we’re checking out Boulies’ latest edition of their Master Series, and it’s fair to say that you’re looking for a gaming chair with a great amount of choice, this is an excellent option.</p>
<p>The Master Series lets you make your first choice with the sizing, with the regular Master Series chair recommended for people between 155cm and 180cm, and weighing up to 110kg. Meanwhile, the Master Max is built for the larger-framed gamer, so that’s anyone standing between 180cm and 200cm, with an increased load that’s capable up to 135kg. Our review unit was in the standard Master Series sizing, but beyond the increased load weight and extra sizing, the designs are fundamentally the same.</p>



<p>Once you’ve chosen your frame, you can select from a range of materials: Ultraflex PU, Water Repellent Fabric, or the top-of-the-range Nappa Leather. With the standard Ultraflex PU pricing currently sitting at £290 in the UK, and the Water Repellent option at £295, the Nappa Leather bringing it up to an ultra-premium £580. That’s a huge difference, but if you’re set on the best of the best, then Boulies gives you that option.</p>
<p>While the leather version is only available in black, the two cheaper finishes come in a range of colours. Our review unit came in water repellent Slate Blue, and I really liked the slightly subdued colour tone, which makes it feel very non-gamer chair. There’s a central black strip through the centre of the chair back, while the seat has two flaring black sections on either side. That’s then further carried through by the black neck pillow that attaches to the top of the chair.</p>


<p>Visually, I think it’s a great-looking chair, and one that manages to retain a certain level of maturity and seriousness. That’s not always the case with gaming chairs, and whether you’re settling in for your hundredth hour of Battlefield, or working on a PowerPoint presentation, this is manages to straddle the line between work and play.</p>
<p>The water repellent fabric they’ve used is very soft, and gentle, and, weirdly, I kind of wanted to find it across the elbow rests too, though that would look pretty odd. Boulies do note that the waterproofing will wear out over time, and that the degradation of that system will come down to how much wear the chair comes in for. So far, there’s no sign of it having lost any of its immunity to an accidental splash of tea or water, but then, I wouldn’t expect it to degrade quite so quickly.</p>
<p>Weird personal expectation aside, the armrests are actually made from soft PU foam. They offer 4D movement – that’s up and down, left and right, forward and back, and rotation on the central axis– and they stay resolutely in the same position once you’ve locked them into place. Adjustments are simple though, so if another person is using the chair, or you suddenly don’t find it’s quite the right fit anymore, the buttons to release them are immediately accessible.</p>

<p>There’s more adjustment to be found elsewhere, starting with the personalised lumbar support. Two dials on each side of the backrest let you alter the placement of the lumbar support, moving it up and down, the supportive bump shifting into the small of your back as needed. It works well, though you’ll likely forget exactly which way the support moves each time you’re using it.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got it all setup how you like it, it’s fair to say that the Boulies Master Chair is hugely comfortable. It’s a little firmer than some gaming chairs, but I actually found that really helpful through longer gaming sessions. You can also change the angle of the backrest, so you can sit studiously upright while working, before leaning all the way back for some more lazy gaming at the end of the day.</p>
<p>As with all gaming chairs, the Boulies Master Series arrived in a massive and heavy box and had to be put together. In the scheme of things, this wasn’t a hard build – you’re talking more like grown-up Duplo rather than Lego Technic – but there are one or two fiddlier moments thanks to having to attach everything to the underside of the seat itself with Allan-key equipped screws.</p>

<p>It took me about half an hour, and while I have put a number of gaming chairs together over the years, I think that anyone with a solid understanding of flat-pack furniture, or who has bought literally anything from IKEA will be at home with what the instructions are asking of you. The only point that you might want to consider is having a second pair of hands for when you’re attaching the chair back, as it’s quite heavy and unwieldy, but I managed it myself without too much problem.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ce2730dafbe3e"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce2730dafbe3e/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released the English translation of its recent financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf">Q&amp;A session</a>, and it mostly covers the company's plans for the Switch 2, its games, and potential movies going forward – lots of stuff we already know about, to be honest.</p>
<p>One question, however, managed to raise a smile on our otherwise stone cold faces, and its regarding the late president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who passed away in 2013 at the age of 85. One attendee essentially asked what kind of comments Yamauchi would make if he were to evaluate the success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Shigeru Miyamoto said that Yamauchi might feel "a sense of envy" at the fact that the Switch 2's numbers are so high. Otherwise, he would remain humble and advise the company to "keep your feet on the ground and do the right thing".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Hypothetically speaking, if (former president) Hiroshi Yamauchi were still alive and evaluated the current state of Nintendo Switch 2, what kind of comments do you think he would make?<br>
<strong><br>
Shigeru Miyamoto:</strong> Yamauchi, as president of Nintendo, might feel a sense of envy that the numbers have surpassed those of his own tenure, but in a typical Kyoto business executive manner, I think he would say, ”Stay humble. Keep your feet on the ground and do the right thing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a nice moment in what is otherwise a pretty straightforward Q&amp;A session. As you'll no doubt already know, Yamauchi was instrumental in transforming Nintendo from a company that specialised in Hanafuda to a global leader in the world of video games.</p>
<p>So yes, we imagine he would probably be both envious and thrilled at just how well the Switch 2 is doing so far. Since its launch back in June, the console has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">already sold over 10 million units</a>, with Nintendo upping its forecast up to 19 million units for the financial year.</p>

<p>Zombies returns in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and there’s plenty to sink your teeth into, including the main quest that advances the story and provides a bunch of easter eggs.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, and Zombies is a huge part of the launch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several maps planned</a>, the return of Dead Ops Arcade, and plenty more teases.</p>



<p>For those wanting to dive immediately into the main quest in Black Ops 7, we’ve got all the details on when you can get your journey started.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-black-ops-7-zombies-main-quest-launch">When Does The Black Ops 7 Zombies Main Quest Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Waiting. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main quest in Black Ops 7 Zombies will be available from 10 AM PT on Friday, November 14.</strong></p>



<p>This release is over 12 hours after the main release of Black Ops 7, so you will have to wait a little longer once you jump into the game for the main quest to go live.</p>



<p>Additionally, Directed Mode will not be available at launch or when the main quest goes live. Instead, Directed Mode will land at the start of Season 01 later in the year.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release times for the main quest in Black Ops 7 Zombies in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Nov. 15</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zombies-before-the-main-quest-launch">Can You Play Zombies Before The Main Quest Launch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Zombies will be fully playable as soon as Black Ops 7 launches, and you don’t need to wait for the main quest launch to jump into the mode.</strong></p>



<p>However, many secrets will be locked at this stage, likely meaning you won’t have full access to all the available Wonder Weapons, and other Easter Eggs won’t be live.</p>



<p>You will be able to play the mode and level up your account, however, which is required to access features like Research, and Zombies will remain a great place to gain the XP needed to push through the early player levels in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/zelda_musou/status/1986357898071638423">Zelda Musou social media account</a> has revealed that two updates are in the works for the game. These updates will be free, it said, and allow fans to "enjoy Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment for even longer".</p>

<p>There is currently no indication of when we can expect these updates to arrive, or what they will actually include when they do. A new fighter or two to expand the roster seems more than likely, though. Any thoughts on who?</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment is set before the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and is the latest crossover with Koei Tecmo's Warriors franchise.

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex has already taken Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a>, calling it Warriors' "richest offering yet".</p>

<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we're keenly aware that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> just hasn't had enough, well, airtime.</p>
<p>Look, two Directs clocking in at 1 hour 45 minutes (yes, longer than <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>) just isn't enough, gosh darn it! So we want to rectify that.</p>
<p>Nintendo kindly invited us to give Kirby Air Riders a whirl, and so we've put together a 20-minute+ video of gameplay for you to peruse at your leisure. We get a good glimpse at some races and the City Trial mode, and while it's not direct-feed, it's pretty good quality nevertheless, if we do say so ourselves.</p>
<p>Don't forget, you can try out Air Riders for yourself with the Global Test Ride, kicking off this weekend for Switch 2 owners. For a proper look at what times you'll need to set aside, be sure to check out our full guide down below.</p>

            <p>You’ve probably noticed that there’s been only a sporadic amount of Nic Reuben in your RPS lately, and we’re sad to say that Nic is leaving the treehouse to resume his glittering freelance career. Please join us in saying goodbye and wishing him well before he jets off on his solid rhodium pleasure plane, never to return (unless we ask him very nicely to review a Warhammer game or something).</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>James:</strong> I distinctly remember, when Nic joined RPS, a feeling of not quite believing our luck. We were bruised at the time from several painful team losses and yet in the space of less than a year, managed to nab both Edwin <em>and</em> Nic, two of the best free agents in the gamewords business. Proper pinch-me stuff. Once in the staff writer chair, he immediately established himself as the best kind of crewmate: not just an excellent person with bottomless wells of empathy and humour, but a writer so damned good that he made everyone around him better. Through, like, talent osmosis. And he didn’t even realise he was doing it.</p>
<p>I can’t list all his best stuff because we’d be here for months. But even before he started at RPS full-time, he was exhibiting a profound skill of looking at games in interesting and unusual ways, like his now-famous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">study of Elden Ring’s pot boy</a>. Or later, an investigation into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">medieval soundscape of Manor Lords</a>. Or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-uk-games-industry-has-a-class-problem-heres-how-one-organisation-is-trying-to-fix-it">picking out the class issues in a whole bunch of stuff</a>. Or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/object-ive-review">Object-ive Review</a>, his Supporters-exclusive series on PC gaming’s finest inanimates. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">skilled</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">reviewer</a> and newsman both, Nic was also exceptional at digging up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-i-only-drink-wine-that-was-aged-listening-to-the-nier-automata-soundtrack-now">offbeat</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-enjoy-daemonologies-incredibly-normal-sheep-with-me">darkly fascinating</a>, usually while deploying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-have-spent-the-morning-learning-about-a-recently-deceased-horse-thanks-to-umamusume-pretty-derby">turns of phrase</a> that could snap your neck with the G’s.</p>
<p>Nic also knew when to sharpen that wit and point it fearlessly at deserving targets, be it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-future-where-you-and-this-bucket-that-fits-over-your-head-decide-what-a-game-meant-to-say-not-the-useless-idiots-that-made-it">embarrassing pro-AI op-eds</a> or, uh, the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-get-my-old-battered-gamer-chair-for-oh-i-dunno-50-quid-1"> deals posts</a> that our bosses sometimes make me do. Still, some of my personal favourite Nic pieces had him doing the opposite, championing cool indie games he’d discovered or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dreams-on-a-pillows-developer-on-the-challenges-of-making-games-from-the-west-bank">telling the stories of marginalised devs</a>. And, of course, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">Booked For The Week</a>, a regular dive into the reading habits of some of the industry’s most accomplished names – a brilliant and deeply RPS-y idea that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-deus-ex-looking-glass-studios-and-othersides-warren-spector">Warren Spector</a> maybe enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-warren-spector-keeps-emailing-me-about-books">a little too much</a>.</p><p>Nic really could do it all, and I’m chuffed to bits that he did it vaguely near the rest of us, from where we could leech at least some of his powers. Goodbye and good luck, Nic – whatever you do next, I’ll be reading.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Nic's work has never failed to bring me joy, even during those horribly busy times when all I could afford to do was glance at the headlines. Just scrolling through his author page, I couldn't help but laugh - more than once - at his fearsome and fearless wit. And then I felt sad once more that he's hauling his enormous sack of talent away from the RPS treehouse.</p>
<p>I mean, just look at this intro to one of his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/battle-prose">Battle Prose</a> diary posts. I picked it at random.</p>
<blockquote>"What do you mean the game didn't save?!", Thilmann had not so much asked Slackbladder as stowed the question in a sack of rocks, spat on the sack until no moisture remained in his body, then swung the sack at Slackbladder's forehead, leaving the thief dazed and more than a little soggy. "What in Odin's gammy eye flap does that even mean?!".<p>No idea, both Slackbladder and the rest of the company were forced to admit. All we knew was that last fight had gone even worse than we'd thought. Dogpollock and Glass Toe Jim Joe Jackon were still dead, but now Terry and Fritz had joined them. "How do you play a battle worse the second time?!" bellowed Thilmann. Again, none of us including Thilmann understood what this meant, although we all agreed it sounded unbelievably stupid. Real "massive idiot who still hasn't learned the game after four diary entries" hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nic is the most phenomenally entertaining writer. It always seemed to be effortless for him. That's almost certainly not true, of course. He probably bled from the eyes sometimes, thinking up the perfect nugget of sarcasm to turn a simple news post into a Nic Reuben News Post. Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say: thank you, Nic, for your offer of eye-blood. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’m sad I didn’t get to work with Nic for all that long. He’s an excellent writer and took on the task of being proudly and gloriously RPSy with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for people who’ve just remembered the capital of Liechtenstein on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He also typed ‘oh no’ in quite a reassuring way when, early in my RPS tenure, I managed to forget to save one of my articles before handing it over for edits, leading it to disappear into the purple ether. Best of luck for the future, Nic. Hope you enjoy the many more words you’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Nic is a magnificent writer, the sort that any gaming site would kill to have. The fact that we possessed a sliver of his soul for a short while meant we were all the better; the sad reality that he is leaving us means that our collective voice has been dampened. His bio here at RPS read that he was secretly “several Skaven in a trenchcoat “ - and if that is truly his real identity, I tip my hat to ‘em, whiskers and all. Said Skaven came down harder than I did on a few games during the last two years (looking at you, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollowbody-is-almost-a-great-survival-horror-game">Hollowbody</a>), but their critiques were always eminently well reasoned and argued. Damn, were they a fine collective of Ratkin. We’ll miss you, Nic.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> Nic, I can’t think of an adequate compliment, and I suspect you have long since cringed yourself into a ball of wrinkled leather over all the embarrassing gushing above, so I’ll try not to overdo my bit. In brief, I have never worked harder or dreamed bigger as a writer than when working day-to-day with you. Ah nuts, fucked it already.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pieces of yours that I especially treasure: your reviews of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">Grunn</a> (“less lock-and-key, more tearing layers of wrapping paper from a massive non-euclidean pass-the-parcel”), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/felvidek-review">Felvidek</a> ("the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime"), and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</a> ("enter teenage android side character Chadley, a grotesque Satnav of a pimple of a productivity app, a creature spawned from fear of Not Enough Game, to squeeze the universe into a ball and wrap checklists around it"). I will also include a few of your best from the news section: your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-is-refreshingly-unlike-xcom-despite-wearing-the-same-tactical-underwear">Tactical Breach Wizards write-up</a>/stealth pitch for "the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me)". Your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys">40-wordish, barely polysyllabic piece on a minor Total Warhammer update</a> that became one of our top articles that day, despite gobbing in the face of SEO. And your graceful intervention about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">Clair Obscur’s team size</a> that pivoted the entire critical conversation around it.</p><p>These are just a handful of my favourites. You are really very good at this writing trade, Nic! It is most vexing. Please carry on doing it in whatever capacity seems right. But in the shorter term, please treat yourself to an awesome break. </p>
