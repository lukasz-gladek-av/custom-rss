            <p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual Sony business presentation</a>, CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live service games, which includes the unreleased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fairgames">Fairgames</a>. That's despite high profile live service failures, in addition to controversy with these two forthcoming games.</p>
<p>Hulst stated that Sony is building on the successes of games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> for future projects, adding: "We look forward to showcasing our progress with Marathon", a game that has seen no shortage of controversy recently.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2, the large jewel in Sony's live service crown, was dubbed a "resounding critical and commercial success" by Hulst, who highlighted both its ability to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">retain a passionate community</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">win industry awards</a>.</p>

<p>Hulst called Marathon "innovative and bold". No other compliments were offered to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter, though the accompanying slide noted "strong early engagement" as its prime achievement so far.</p>
<p>An interesting perspective to be sure, at least as far as Marathon is concerned. While much of what Hulst said about Helldivers 2 is true - the game has managed to remain a fantastic success story for the industry giant - Marathon has found itself on the receiving end of some exceptional problems.</p>
<p>The "strong early engagement" noted in the presentation doesn't reflect the available player figures for the games' closed alpha. During this short-lived test, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1k9fob3/marathon_has_lost_roughly_80_of_its_playerbase/">Marathon shed roughly 80 percent of its initial alpha playerbase</a>. As far as engagement via discussion, Marathon's many problems dominated the conversation, such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/04/it-may-be-too-late-to-fix-marathons-core-problem/">its locked three-player format and lack of feasible solo mode</a>, repetitive nature, lack of crucial extraction shooter features such as proximity voice, and more.</p>
<p>One of the biggest merits of Marathon was its aesthetic, which soon soured due to an art plagiarism scandal. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to the use of external art in the games development process</a>, blaming it on a former employee and committing to a full audit of in-game assets in order to remove any stolen work. This situation would reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">send morale at Bungie into "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>Then we have Fairgames, which hasn't been shown off much since its initial reveal. A co-operative heist game, it was recently delayed due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">studio founder Jade Raymond departing for greener pastures</a>. This came following worrying external tests, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">according to a report from Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>According to Raymond in a 2022 <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">Gamesindustry.biz</a> article, "more than 30 percent of the studio is currently working on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based dev tools", technology that has proven divisive in recent years. Not to mention what could possibly be the most devastating hit to Fairgames yet: the removal of the dollar sign from its title.</p>
<p>It is clear that, despite uncertainty surrounding Sony's upcoming live service releases, the company wishes to remain entrenched in the space. Or, at the very least, to appear confident in its continued presence in the world of live service. It's worth noting the full record of Sony's venture into live service, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">the legendary blunder Concord</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled live service God of War project</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">The Last of Us Online</a>, and more. Sony, which initially wanted to release 12 live service games by March 2026, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">has cut that figure down to six</a>.</p>
<p>Sony's single-player output however has proven a far better offering for PlayStation fans. Earlier in this presentation, Hulst highlighted releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>. Describing such releases as "a core strength" for Sony, it appears as though this style of game has proven more successful overall for the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Having recently been slated for a July 31st release date on Nintendo Switch, the upcoming — and very exciting — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will now also receive two physical editions. Get in!</p>

<p>These physical editions ("breathtaking", according to Silver Lining), which take the form of your usual standard and special variants and are scheduled for 12th September, are broken down in the PR blurb:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Standard Edition delivers<br>

-</em> <em>Heart-pounding <strong>soundtrack<br>
-</strong></em> <em>Retro booklet</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Special Edition Includes:<br>

-</strong></em> <em><strong>Cloth map</strong> - frame it or study it like a true warrior.<br>
-</em> <em><strong>4 metal pins</strong> - Bold, pixel-art-inspired designs you’ll want to show off (or guard like treasure).-<br>
-</em> <em><strong>Double-Sided Hero Medallion</strong> - A solid metal coin featuring both protagonists: feel the weight of the legend!<br>

-</em> <em><strong>Double-Sided Poster</strong> – Wall-worthy art showdown!<br>
-</em> <em>All encased in a premium <strong>collector’s box</strong></em></p>

<p>Both physical editions are <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/search?q=ragebound&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">now available to order at Silver Lining's Direct website</a>, with the standard costing £39.99 and the special coming in at £59.99 (or whatever that ends up equating to wherever you are).</p>
<p>As for the game itself, well, with the creators of the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, working alongside the masters who've brought us the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous_plus_blasphemous_2_bundle">Blasphemous</a> franchise, we couldn't be more excited to see how this new new addition to the series melds its slick retro art style with aspects that fuse retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/ninja_gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/ninja_gaiden_3_razors_edge">more modern 3D entries</a>.</p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature">promised earlier this year</a>, Valve have given Steam developers the power to tag their games as having certain accessibility features, including narrated game menus, ways of differentiating visual elements that don't rely on colour, and touch-only interaction. You'll now be able to search for games with these tags, and view the full list of accessibility features on each game's Steam page.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update is based on feedback from developers as well as players with disabilities, according to Valve. Participating devs can make use of the system by means of a software wizard - ah, I find it vaguely comforting that people still call this kind of program a "wizard" - which walks them through each accessibility category. Valve say that "over 5000 applications" have already made use of the new tags.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games," they note <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500575275933763410">in a blog post</a>. "We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>The new accessibility tags are broadly divided into "visual", "audio", "gameplay" and "input". The "gameplay" bracket includes "adjustable difficulty" and "save anytime", while under "visual" we find options like "camera comfort", which lets players "adjust or disable uncomfortable camera movement such as screen shaking, camera bob, or motion blur".</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">full breakdown on Steamworks</a>, including Valve's notes on why each option is important to players.</p>
<p>The selection of taggable features could probably do with some expansion, and the FAQ descriptions themselves are rather brief and broad. When the accessibility tags were announced in April, accessibility-focussed website Can I Play That <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested</a> that Valve should base their system on the existing <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Games Initiative</a>, which aims to standardise accessibility tagging across every game store, to avoid confusing players.</p>
<p>"According to the list in the documentation there is a lot of overlap, and it's mostly Steam that is missing a few tags," Can I Play That wrote. "Steam's version also uses some different names and descriptions. Perhaps most importantly, there also seem to be differences in the criteria."</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad to see this kind of thing from Valve. There's certainly a business case for it, inasmuch as options for players with impaired vision need to be justified in terms of the balance sheet. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">World Health Organisation</a>, 1.3 billion people worldwide "experience a significant disability". Back in 2023, our James wrote a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">custom and adaptive controllers in particular</a>, discussing how corporate profit motives inevitably limit the options, together with the lingering problem of ableist players perceiving accessibility features as 'cheating'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye may look like an exciting, GTA-adjacent action-adventure in short clips and GIFs, but actually playing it through to the end of its story has revealed an unfinished, overly ambitious project that’s plagued with performance problems, makes precious little use of its open world, and is crippled by unconvincing combat and dull mission design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s natural to draw comparisons with GTA, in basic terms MindsEye is more akin to the Mafia series. That is, it’s a tightly linear, single-player story where the open world largely exists as a backdrop for you to drive from mission to mission. That doesn’t end up serving it very well. Mafia is great. MindsEye is not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Jacob Diaz, a former soldier and drone operator who has been railroaded out of the military after a botched mission, albeit with an extremely rare piece of tech still embedded in his neck. He’s a pretty thinly drawn amnesiac hero overall, with no especially memorable characteristics beyond his ability to follow instructions. After securing a security job at mega-company Silva Corp in the Las Vegas-inspired city of Redrock, Diaz is quickly embroiled in an AI-gone-bad, robots-gone-wild adventure that starts slow, gets a little more intriguing a few hours in, and then ends like someone’s yanked the plug out of the wall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>MindsEye does have style, and its near-future setting is accomplished and credible. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Credit where it’s due, MindsEye <em>does </em>have style, and its near-future setting is accomplished and credible. It fuses locations like normal homes and strip malls that wouldn’t look out of place in the present day with the proliferation of high-tech robotics and drones. The result is a world that appears appropriately futuristic, but doesn’t feel alien or unrecognisable. From an aesthetic perspective, it really does appear a few years from now in a well-executed way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also includes a genuinely impressive fleet of vehicles – and there’s a practicality to them that makes them look like real cars from, say, five to 10 years in the future. It basically takes modern trends – like today’s massive, chunkily-accented pick-up trucks, teardrop-shaped electric sedans, and battery-powered retromods – and successfully projects a decade of tweaks onto them. More importantly, the handling is actually genuinely good in a way open-world action games rarely manage. The cars you actually get to drive are weighty and really love to be whipped into high-speed handbrake turns through the realistically thick traffic. There’s none of that stickiness that’s typical of GTA clones like Sleeping Dogs (which I love regardless) or Saints Row (which I do not). You know, the kind of superficial handling that feels like you’re turning the world under the car, rather than the car itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is largely where the praise stops.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mind Over Matter</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first mission is a short drive into the desert to shoot four robots who barely have the vigour to fire back, and the second requires you to track a slow-moving thief by monitoring a security console and… switching cameras. It’s not exactly an explosive opening stanza, but things don’t get that much better when the bullets really start flying. It’s around 10 hours of the most boringly straightforward missions from the past decades of open-world action games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat against the handful of bot types and human soldiers is mostly just plain, and dud enemy AI doesn’t make for particularly satisfying shootouts. Humans are the least sensible. Sometimes they take cover; sometimes they just walk towards you waiting to get shot. Run out to meet them and they’re confusingly slow to react (not that this is a particularly strong tactic, as there is no melee attack). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dud enemy AI doesn’t make for particularly satisfying shootouts.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s just janky. On the one hand, you can actually shoot individual pieces – including weapons – off the bots. That’s nice. On the other, put a round into a human standing behind some scenery and they’ll often blink back into cover with no linking animation whatsoever. That’s shoddy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not due to a lack of firepower, because MindsEye does feature plenty of guns, although it mostly just chucks them into your arsenal with so little fanfare I usually didn’t notice. I’d just spot something new in my weapon wheel, like another assault rifle, or some kind of energy blaster. It’s rarely clear about what you should be using at any given moment, and it doesn’t seem to matter much. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action does improve towards the back end of the story, as Diaz gets access to all his partner drone’s special perks. The ability to zap an enemy robot and turn it into an instant ally gives the action some zest that it absolutely lacks out of the gate. Your drone’s grenade ability is also neat for a while, but it’s probably a bit <em>too </em>effective at clearing out enemies ahead. I spent most of the late game missions as my drone, dropping endless grenades on soldiers and robots from high above. It made what turned out to be the penultimate battle into one of the easiest because the bad guys just have no defense against this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The primary problem I had with MindsEye, though, was its drastically uneven performance on my high-end PC (RTX 4080, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H). While the auto settings placed the bulk of the configurable options at ‘High’ – and capped the frame rate at 60fps – my playthrough was rife with issues. It’s regularly blurry and choppy when panning, and the frame rate would flutter and sometimes hang. During one car chase performance chugged to a crawl and was only barely playable. Sometimes even the cutscenes would stutter and display ghosting. Experimenting with lowering the settings hasn’t yielded much in the way of positive results. It’s in really rough shape technically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, there <em>are </em>definitely moments in MindsEye when it looks quite stunning. Explosions are excellent. The sunlight piercing through Redrock’s glitzy hotels is seriously snazzy. I liked the sheer scale and complexity of the Silva factory’s rocket loader, and at one point the metallic sheen of a parked jet in the desert glare stopped me in my tracks. When it runs well and looks good, it looks very good. But six months ago I played through Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on this machine and it performed fabulously. MindsEye does not. It’s like Steven Seagal circa 1990: Looks cool – just doesn’t know how to run properly.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s like Steven Seagal circa 1990: Looks cool – just doesn’t know how to run properly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance optimisation won’t solve MindsEye’s myriad other issues, though. A lot of these are really just baked into how it’s designed. Too often, the missions are simply restrictive and <em>dull</em>. All you can do is drive a pre-assigned vehicle to a marker. That triggers a cutscene. Then you shoot everything. Then drive somewhere else. It’s all so rigid and leaves no room for the kind of goofing around or antics you can get into in comparable games, and there’s certainly none of the emergent fun you constantly get in something like GTA. MindsEye rarely trusts us to even park at a mission marker; it generally just splutters into a cutscene when you get close enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t help that there are no radio stations or songs to listen to as you’re commuting between missions. Travel time from A to B mostly seems to exist to feed you phone calls to prod the story along a little further. Exploration is actively disencouraged, and you’ll be constantly scolded for not heading directly to your destination, or failed out. There’s no reason to explore anyhow, as it isn’t the sort of living world you might have expected. Police don’t even respond to Diaz’s crimes, so what’s even the point?</p><div id="rank-these-non-gta-open-world-actiondriving-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3><h3>Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s not really anything out there to find. Hunting for a cool vehicle to use? Don’t bother. Other vehicles are off-limits. Wreck the car you were assigned? That’s a mission fail. You won’t even be able to get out of it if it's burning. It’s a baffling choice for a game like this – the entire genre is built around stealing cars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye has <em>some </em>good ideas. An effective stealth mission mid-way is a positive change of pace, and there are some unexpected puzzles late in the piece that gave me a break from blasting. But it relegates the rest of them to its roughly two hours of cutscenes and wastes their potential. At one point a squad of robots are set sprinting after my car at highway speeds. While I was preparing myself for a potentially thrilling chase, the robots caught the car and destroyed it before the cinematic finished. This kind of thing is a real rug pull in a game that, a few hours earlier, made me play through a frustrating, one-off CPR minigame that could’ve just been a cutscene.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/vlcsnap-2025-06-13-16h59m26s447-1749799399148.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive...</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even apparent bosses die in cutscenes. And in an unforgivable transgression, if there’s a way to skip them (even when replaying missions and watching them a second time), I couldn’t find it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bots on Your Mind</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The kicker is, even if you get swept up in the sunk-cost fallacy of finishing this 10-hour campaign just to see how the story pans out, the ending itself is a colossal anticlimax. I’ll obviously refrain from spilling the specifics of the final moment, but it’s impossible to complete any assessment of MindsEye’s defects without explaining how deeply and desperately unsatisfying I found it. Story threads are left dangling and reams of questions remain unanswered. It’s not an artistic cliffhanger; it’s just vague and unearned. It’s an ending that feels like the writer was out of fresh paper and this was the only thing that would fit on the last line of the script’s final page. Picture Ghostbusters crashing to credits a few seconds after they cross the streams and you’re about there. There’s a PS after the unskippable credits, but it only makes things worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, until what happens <em>after </em>the finale, that is. After the story wrapped I was simply tossed back into the open world as… some random weirdo in a crop top. He has some kind of… base? With things in it I can interact with that do… nothing? There’s no explanation of how anything works, no direction, and no purpose. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/vlcsnap-2025-06-13-17h27m22s024-1749799775735.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">What.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Confused, I left the building in search of a vehicle, but even here you can’t carjack civilians, and you can’t steal parked cars. I got in the only one that would allow me to enter and drove to an icon that looked like the Hamburglar stealing a car. There was another car there, glowing, but I couldn’t enter it. I shot at the bystanders, and I shot at the soldiers. The soldiers popped out of their 4X4s like waffles from an overzealous toaster. Nothing else happened. No armed response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got back in the small hatchback I arrived in, which remained the only vehicle I could interact with. I drove to an icon that looked like a chess piece. The performance took another significant nosedive as I arrived. There were some soldiers there, spread throughout a multi-story parking lot. I shot at them until I got bored, which happened almost instantly because the action is restricted to basic third-person blasting. Chubby crop top man has none of the entertaining drone attacks that Diaz has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it appears, is MindsEye’s free-roaming mode. It’s separate from the main campaign, but I have no idea what we’re intended to <em>do </em>in it. It’s pointless, scrappy, and a complete waste of time in this state. It just isn’t <em>remotely </em>close to finished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I am. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled Concord offline just two weeks after launch, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It has proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted amid the closure of its developer, Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What has Sony learned from the Concord disaster, and how does that relate to Marathon, Bungie’s in-development extraction live service shooter? Hermen Hulst, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group, was asked that question during an investor focused interview. Responding, Hulst admitted that feedback to Marathon’s recent alpha test had been “varied,” but insisted the game will be released during Sony’s current fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, and promised that the mistakes it made with Concord would not be repeated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Live service, we really see that as a great opportunity for us,” Hulst said. “But with this great opportunity are some unique challenges associated. We talked about some early success as with Helldivers 2. We’ve also faced some challenges, as with the release of Concord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think some really good work, actually, went into that title, some really big effort. But ultimately that title entered into a hyper competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so we have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we’re not going to make the same mistakes again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As I said earlier, we’ve introduced much more rigorous processes for validating, for re-validating, our creative, our commercial, our development assumptions and hypotheses, and we now do that on a much more ongoing basis. That’s the plan that will ensure we are investing in the right opportunities at the right time, all while maintaining much more predictable timelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For Marathon, it’s our goal to release a very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title. It’s going to be the first new Bungie title in over a decade. So we’re really excited for that release. We’re monitoring, we’re going through the test cycles. We’re monitoring the closed alpha cycle the team has just gone through. We’re taking all the lessons learned, we’re using the capabilities we’ve built and analytics and user testing to understand how audiences are engaging with the title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of that feedback, frankly, has been varied. But it’s super useful. That’s why you do this testing. The constant testing, the constant re-validation of assumptions that we just talked about, to me is just so valuable to iterate and to constantly improve the title, so when launch comes, we’re going to give the title the optimal chance of success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game. And we’re committed to continuing to leverage our learnings, to maximise engagement and player satisfaction throughout the lifecycle of the title.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulst failed to address <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-discuss-marathon-developer-bungies-future-after-yet-another-plagiarism-row-rocks-studio-make-no-mistake-this-is-an-existential-struggle-for-bungie-at-this-point">the recent art plagiarism scandal that embroiled Bungie and Marathon</a>, however. Last month, Bungie was left scrambling to recover its reputation after yet another independent artist accused the studio of "lifting" their artwork in Marathon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>The accusation</u></a> prompted an "immediate investigation" and acknowledgement from the studio that a "former Bungie artist" had indeed used Fern Hook's work without compensation or credit. Soon after, Marathon game director Joe Ziegler and art director Joe Cross apologized on a painfully uncomfortable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORBkGmHaoQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>livestream</u></a> that featured no Marathon art or footage at all, as the team was "still scrubbing all of our assets to make sure that we are being respectful of the situation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service plan has seen significant success but also catastrophic failure. The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend, which recently suffered mass layoffs as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u>launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</u></a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences"><u>the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</u></a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern">Raymond has since left the company</a>), and the now shuttered Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in 2023, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025, meaning by the end of March 2026. Totoki said Sony was still working on when the other six live service games would come out, adding: "It's not that we stick to certain titles, but for the gamers quality should be the most important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio-spun-out-of-bungie-thats-making-a-team-based-action-game-inspired-by-fighting-games-mobas-and-frog-type-games"><u>Sony announced a new PlayStation studio called teamLFG and teased its debut game</u></a>, which is a live service incubation project. Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer game is also in development, as is Haven's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more generally about Sony’s live service ambition, Hulst said the company remains “very, very committed to building a diverse and a resilient live service portfolio.” He pointed to MLB The Show, Destiny 2, and Helldivers 2 as “really good examples of the type of titles we’re looking to develop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These titles have already established an enduring set of player experiences and communities across quite a wide range of different genres,” he said. “Together that provides a really good foundation for our ambitions in this category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say additionally we are continuing to invest in new live services, with Helldivers 2 providing such a great example of the level of success we can achieve — if we get everything right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That game has been a true breakout success, it’s been attracting and retaining significant community and very engaged players since we launched that back in February 2024. And its ongoing success I think is further evidence in how we deal with the monetization. Microtransactions now in that game make up more than half of the revenue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the kicker: a commitment to releasing Marathon by the end of March 2026: “We’re also very excited about Marathon’s anticipated launch in this fiscal year,” Hulst confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> is the latest Capcom game to surpass the 10m units sold milestone.</p>
<p>The studio shared the news today, crediting the game's "advanced story and action elements" for its ongoing popularity, as well as the addition of a new playable character.</p>
<p>There is one other thing that has given Devil May Cry a bit of a sales boost in more recent months - the arrival of Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series back in April. Based on <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab2">previous sales data</a>, Devil May Cry 5 has shifted approximately 9k units since the show's debut.</p>

<p>Celebrating Devil May Cry's latest sales milestone, Capcom said the anime had been met with critical acclaim and boasts more than 5.3m views.</p>
<p>"As a result of the game's exhilarating action, and due to efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of videogames, including television adaptations, the title has now exceeded 10m units in cumulative sales worldwide," Capcom wrote.</p>
<p>The Devil May Cry video game series as a whole has now sold more than 33m units since the first title was released all the way back in 2001. "Capcom remains firmly committed to satisfying the expectations of all stakeholders by leveraging its industry-leading game development capabilities in order to create highly entertaining gameplay experiences," the company closed.</p>
<p>As for the Netflix adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-devil-may-cry-animated-series-gets-positive-update-one-week-after-debut">Devil May Cry has been renewed for a second season</a>. The first season followed demon hunter Dante as he was pitted against the powerful White Rabbit who had ideas to unleash hell on earth, because things just aren't bad enough already.</p>
<p>Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>.</p>

<p>Nishino noted that for over 30 years PlayStation has been "committed to being the best place to play and publish", adding the PlayStation console experience is designed for "immediate gameplay in an immersive and accessible way". That said, the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>Hulst then affirmed that PlayStation is "continuously exploring new ways for players to interact with their franchises", before adding: "It's important to realise that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, a very deliberate approach in doing that.</p>
<p>"Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are real showcases of the performance, of the quality of the hardware, so we want to ensure that players get the best experience from these titles."</p>
<p>Continuing, Hulst said PlayStation is very "thoughtful" about the "how and if we bring these titles to other platforms".</p>
<p>"We need to constantly understand the players' patterns and behaviours," Nishino further explained. "We need to be sure we serve them appropriately. [Hulst] and myself are very, very focused on this, and investing as needed to evolve the PlayStation experience."</p>
<p>When further asked about Microsoft's multiplatform push, which has seen games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> and more arrive on non-Xbox consoles, Nishino said "competition in the business is healthy" and helps drive innovation.</p>
<p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall gaming industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said.</p>
<p>"However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy. There isn't an urgent need for us to pivot, but we will continue to monitor play patterns appropriately as required."</p>

<p>PlayStation has been steadily adding many of its titles to PC over the past few years, with the likes of Uncharted, The Last of Us and Spider-Man now all available on that additional platform. In February of this year, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-games-on-pc-is-almost-like-printing-money-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC was "almost like printing money"</a>, and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PlayStation published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">becoming the company's first single player game to pass 100,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Stellar Blade shattered expectations when it arrived as a PlayStation 5 exclusive last year. Despite being the debut console title from Korean gacha game developer Shift-up, the game was knocking it out of the park with striking gameplay, incredible music, and gorgeous high-definition visuals that stood confidently alongside Sony’s first-party heavy hitters like God of War and Spider-man. The fervor around an eventual PC port of this game has been bustling since it released. As someone who only ever played a demo of the original PlayStation 5 release, this PC port combined with it’s bundled assortment of crossover DLC served as my wake-up call to finally dive in. And across my desktop PC and my Steam Deck OLED, Stellar Blade has impressed me on every level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VyeH5uteVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The graphics and display options on offer here are comparable to other Sony PC ports in how exhaustive and detailed the list of settings to tweak are. Resolution scaling will be set to either NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-FSR-TECH-PREVIEW.html">FSR 4</a> or FSR 3, depending on the GPU you use. FSR 3 is the universal option, comparable to the upscaling used on PS5, while FSR 4 is closer to DLSS in how it works and exclusive to the new Radeon RX 9000 GPUs.</p>


<p>With upscaling enabled, the game raced to an average 90-100 FPS when played at 1440P with max graphics settings on my GeForce RTX 3080. A couple cutscenes full of lots of monsters would cause minor dips, but they were rare and I never felt like the resolution scaling was a distraction. This can even be combined with DLSS frame generation, the game easily hit smooth framerates without major graphical downgrades.</p>


<p>What blew me away, though, was that even with resolution scaling turned completely off, the game was able to maintain a locked 60FPS at 1440P nearly the entire time. As is typicaly, the RTX 3080 easily outperforms every base PlayStation 5 graphics mode, which relied on scaling solutions to hit those targets. Playing any new games at 4K and a steady FPS feels like a pipe dream unless you’ve got a beefy rig or generate half your frames, but Stellar Blade shows a level of optimisation that so few AAA games nowadays do.</p>
<p>Even better, this all means the game is great on Steam Deck. So many recent Sony PC ports require a lot of visual compromise to just barely run on the Valve’s handheld PC, but Stellar Blade feels like it was made for this form factor. The game stays at a steady framerate and maintains a shocking amount of it’s original visual detail and quality.</p>

<p>Packed in alongside the base game content is a duology of crossover DLC with other games that carry a similar thematic through-line of “if android, why hot?” – Square Enix’s&nbsp;Nier Automata&nbsp;an Shift-up’s own title&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory.&nbsp;Both DLC are more a collection of easter eggs and bonus activities than they are a massive expansion or story continuation. If you’re a fan of either property though, the amount of references and call-backs and familiar costumes tossed in from each game are a delight. The&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory&nbsp;DLC in particular, which launched alongside this port, includes a new fishing mini-game, a cover-shooter mission series replicating the gameplay from the fanservice-filled gacha game, and an entire new boss fight against a major character from that title. My only complaint? No love for my favorite&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;character, Elegg. BOOM is life.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade&nbsp;is incredible on PC, and doesn’t compromise at all on any of the quality from the original PlayStation 5 release. For existing fans, the upgrades in resolution and framerate potential are a revelation and the new&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;dlc is a blast. For those who haven’t played the game yet, this is easily the most accessible and versatile way to check it out.</p>

<p>13-second sprint round Koopa Troopa Beach, anyone?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="MARIO KART WORLD REWIND LAP TIMES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aea2877ec2b85/mario-kart-world-rewind-lap-times.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Leave it to Nintendo to put a mechanic into a game that can be used in lots of 'unintended' ways. Then leave it to the typical Nintendo fan to figure out how to mess with it almost immediately.</p>
<p>Yes, just as we are routinely amazed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/random-game-dev-builds-baffling-contraptions-to-solve-zelda-totk-addison-puzzles">what players come up with in the likes of Tears of the Kingdom</a>, it's taken very little time for them to start <em>doing things</em> to Mario's fancy new rewind feature in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - which, when playing offline, allows you to cycle back through a race by holding down on your D-pad, then resume from where you paused.</p>
<p>For your average player (or just me) this will be deployed with zero imagination, used to correct course when we've crashed or fix things when we've taken a big blue shell to the bonce. That sort of caper. Of course, if you're a real gamer<strong>™</strong>, you'll do much smarter things.</p>
<p>Take, for example, YouTube creator <a href="https://youtu.be/TF3KYsz9ZLY?si=O23AHBjUV3M8D9bG">Jopes</a>, who (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/mario-kart-worlds-new-rewind-feature-can-be-used-in-time-trials-to-set-wild-records-like-this-13-second-lap/">and as spotted by GamesRadar</a>) uploaded a video showing how you can take a course that's nice and small (he uses a few, such as Koopa troopa Beach), and then rewind all the way back through an entire lap from the finish line.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that, because the rewind feature is sped-up, you reap the benefits of how quickly you move:</p>

<p>Once he'd honed his technique down (and you should check out the video above as it's really neat and packed full of detail), he's managed to get his lap time down to <em>12.856 seconds</em>!</p>
<p>Now, to get to that lap time, he's done some clever driving, too, taking shortcuts and going off-road, so do give the eight-minute video a watch as there's way too much nuance to detail here. Also, you can then try to best his time.</p>
<p>Of course, the new Mario Kart is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/youll-want-to-learn-these-new-mario-kart-world-tricks-if-you-hope-to-win">packed full of new ways to gain speed boosts and get better times</a> without resorting to rewind feature shenanigans, therefore we're sure we'll be seeing some more eye-opening stuff in fairly short order. Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>PlayStation is fully committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with their content and services, but this new method will hardly be limited to cloud gaming.</p>
<p>Speaking during an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor-focused interview</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino was asked directly about the future of the company, starting with cloud gaming, which has seen an increase in popularity in the past few years. While PlayStation has been in the cloud gaming business for the last 11 years, deploying cloud gaming services since the PlayStation 3 generation, Nishino-san highlighted how the cloud gaming business model has to be sustainable for the long-term growth, and despite the technological advancements of the past few years, the SIE CEO believes that the vast majority of players will continue to want a traditional experience based on local hardware, without depending on the network conditions, which are an unpredictable variable. From this statement, it's clear how the next PlayStation will be a traditional console, but interestingly enough, Nishino-san highlighted how they are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with the company's content and services, a statement that seems to hint at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">unannounced handheld</a> that is reportedly in the works.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the new and enhanced way for players to engage with content and services, Sony Interactive Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst touched upon the company's multiplatform strategy, saying that they're being thoughtful about bringing their franchises off consoles to reach a new audience, especially regarding single player games, which are considered as the point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are the real showcase of the performance and quality of the hardware, so the company is constantly thinking hard about how and if these titles are brought to other platforms. As such, it seems like the current strategy of late PC ports for single-player games will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>While ports of PlayStation Studios' developed games are likely to continue releasing on PC years after their console debut, that doesn't seem to be the case with games that are only published by the company. Shift Up's Stellar Blade launched on PC only a year after its console debut, and Lost Soul Aside will be launching simultaneously on PC and console this August. Hopefully, the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">success of Stellar Blade on PC</a> will compel PlayStation to focus more on the PC market in the future.</p>

		<p>It’s been a long and busy week, with last weekend being a mad juggle of trying to play as much Switch 2 as possible while also covering Summer Game Fest streams and showcases. The Switch 2 gaming has continued through to this week, as Dom and I led the charge on doing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">a broad look at backward compatibility games</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077’s impressive port</a>, and I published our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/">hardware review</a> after gathering my thoughts from the first week.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty more Switch 2 stuff to do, though. I’ll soon be telling you about how the Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a “transfigurational” port. Can you tell that I’m happy with this reference?</p>

<p>For some reason, I asked everyone to tell me relay their week’s gaming while making it rhyme. Not everyone was up to the task, but we did get some nice poems.</p>
<p>Here’s <strong>Ade</strong>:</p>

<p><em>For review I played Alter, and I didn’t falter. It was very hard, like frozen lard, but I saw it through to the end, and confirm that money on it people should spend.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> was more of a limerick:</p>
<p><em>I played Switch 2 with my wife</em><br>
<em>I thought to myself ‘what a life!’</em><br>
<em>But I didn’t let her win</em><br>
<em>My Switch 2 is in the bin</em><br>
<em>Who knew Mario Kart causes such strife?</em></p>
<p>And here’s <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> effort:</p>
<p><em>I start by playing Balatro,</em><br>
<em>Then Warhammer, I’m sure you know,</em><br>
<em>But then I remembered a review,</em><br>
<em>That is what I should do,</em><br>
<em>So I looked at Baldur’s Gate and said no!</em></p>
<p><em>Instead I played Zombie Army,</em><br>
<em>And after that the Atomfall DLC,</em><br>
<em>The reviews will come soon,</em><br>
<em>Before the full moon,</em><br>
<em>Because then a werewolf I’ll be.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I’m a werewolf.</em></p>
<p>Sadly nobody else was willing to take on this task, <strong>Steve</strong> even said that these efforts caused him “significant discomfort as a lecturer in English Lit and Creative Writing.” So we’re back to the boring land of basic prose, and he played “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ten-horror-game-demos-to-chill-and-thrill-you-in-steam-next-fest-this-week/">a whole bunch of Steam demos</a> and put a few hours into Mario Kart World.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Mario Kart World, <strong>Nic’s</strong> son decided to add a little bit of “4D haptics” to his gaming by whacking him in the Mushroom Kingdom’s crown jewels. Ouch! He also played Split Fiction, Survival Kids and Bravely Default’s remake on Switch 2, with reviews for them all still in the pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> tired of playing games where he wasn’t the named protagonist, so went back to Blades of Fire to fight some things. He’s also reviewed Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon, which is a good game marred by so many technical issues.</p>
<p>After checking out Nioh 3’s demo some more, and revisiting Dynasty Warriors: Origins for a Shu playthrough, <strong>Jim</strong> moved on to the Cairn demo. “It’s a truly unique game about climbing a mountain, from the devs who created the fantastic Furi, that somehow manages to be zen and infuriating at the same time. I’m looking forward to playing the full release though I’m hoping the performance improves drastically on PS5 (the demo was super choppy).”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> got to keep quiet about Death Stranding 2 a little longer.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / PS5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a208dca657808/switch-2-ps5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been out for a little over a week now, and it's already breaking records in multiple regions. Nintendo has confirmed that the console <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold 3.5 million units in the first four days of sale</a>, but it's also become the fastest-selling Nintendo console in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>, and Japan. In the latter region specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">Switch 2 also beat the PlayStation 2</a> to become the fast-selling console <em>of all time</em>. Crikey.</p>
<p>Naturally, thoughts are inevitably turning toward Nintendo's direct competition, and whether the likes of Sony and Microsoft might be concerned about the Switch 2's monumental success. Well, <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">according to SIE's new president and CEO, Hideaki Nishino</a> during a Business Segment fireside chat, the company isn't particularly bothered (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-sony-says-ps5-performance-required-for-great-experience-on-a-big-screen/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>When asked if the Switch 2's improved specs and Nintendo's relationships with third-party publishers caused any concern, Nishino was keen to reiterate the appeal of the PS5 against its competitors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We closely monitor the overall gaming industry, including the actions of other market participants. Additionally, catalysts in the market are great for the industry as a whole, as they invigorate the excitement and demand more broadly. So it’s great to have people launching new things.</p>
<p>“However, as I mentioned previously, we have a differentiated strategy. PlayStation 5 is designed for an immersive gaming experience, and this includes the innovative DualSense controller features as well. We believe PS5-level performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering for players and creators in this current console generation.</p>
<p>“However, publisher strategies are increasingly shifting towards being multi-platform, so more platforms can run the same game, which is great from a creator’s perspective. Among those platforms, our mission is that we will continue to be the best place to play and publish.</p>
<p>“As such, we have empowered our creators to leverage our offering and services to create amazing, unique experiences for players with high engagement and great monetisation opportunities. We have done this consistently as the industry and competitive dynamics have evolved. And of course, PlayStation Studios, our franchises, have a special role in showcasing the PlayStation experience and then strengthening the player’s vision with us.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Sony, the PS5 is a great system, though we'd be lying if we said that its first-party offering was thriving at the moment. Sony has struggled recently with its ill-conceived focus on live-service games, resulting in the highly-publicised failure of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/concord">Concord</a>, the cancellation of <strong>The Last of Us Online</strong>, and ongoing concerns around Bungie's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, PS5 will have pretty tempting exclusives this year in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/saros">Saros</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> following later.</p>
<p>There's room for all, is what we're saying. But it's going to be interesting to see how the dynamic between the Big Three changes with the Switch 2. Chances are there are a few publishers who regret not supporting the Switch enough in recent years, so we suspect that will no doubt change going forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-allow-music-artists-to-upload-their-music-directly-in-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is set to revolutionize music handling in open-world games, if a well-known music producer's recent revelations are true.</p>
<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newrorynmal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Rory and Mal</a> show, Grammy-winning music producer Jermaine Dupri surprisingly revealed that artists will be able to upload their music directly to an unspecified Grand Theft Auto game. While the music producer did not specifically mention Grand Theft Auto VI, there's no way this feature would get added to the fifth entry in the series so late after its release, so there's little doubt that this will be a feature in the game launching next year on consoles. Jermain Dupri also added that the rapper Drake will have his own radio station, and from his understanding, the rapper himself could upload music to the game that is not available anywhere, something that would turn Grand Theft Auto VI into a music streaming service like Spotify and the like.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jermaine Dupri, Ray Vaughn, Claressa Shields &amp; More Join us at the BET Awards Pt. 1 | NEW RORY &amp; MAL" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le8zt-XrrNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While we have to take all the above with a huge grain of salt, it would definitely make sense for Rockstar Games to do something like this for Grand Theft Auto VI, considering how music has always been important in every entry in the series, and how the game is setting out to be the most successful game release of all time. I personally hope the option, if real, will be available to a wide variety of artists, as nothing would beat going around the game's beautiful world with some pumping rock and metal tunes, bringing back to mind the days of roaming about Vice City with Iron Maiden's 2 Minutes to Midnight, Megadeth's Peace Sells and Ozzy Osbourne's Bark at the Moon playing in the background.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a> worldwide.</p>

            <p>If you're desperate for some company of a non-Adoring Fan kind as you run around Cyrodiil in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, odds are the base game'll leave you wanting. Enter a new mod, which adds in a beast master system that'll let you tame a furry or scaly pet.</p>
<p>After all, one could argue you've not really experienced Tamriel unless you're having to stop after every fight to give your precious wild boar Bobo some heal minor wounds-infused tummy tickles</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4468">Beast Master</a> is the mod in question, and the latest example of prolific ColdTyrant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-right-there-oblivion-remastered-modder-imperial-watch-proper-joinable-faction-new-quests-and-a-corruption-system">working to revamp</a> 2025's most 2006 release by giving folks new stuff to try once they've had their fill of shutting spooky doors. </p>
<p>Building on the pretty basic command creature spell from the base game, which Wood Elves have as a racial ability, he's put together a means for you to tame any animal you come across in the wilderness via magic and have it permanently join you on your adventures as a named "combat pet". In addition to being commandable and aiding you in fights like any regular companion, these pets can be fed grub from your inventory and interacted with in order to check on their mood.</p>
<p>That last bit has no impact in gameplay, so the mod's more of the casual pet ownership experience than a full Nintendogs-style furry thing parent simulation that'll leave you feeling even more unnerved than usual about your real life ability to look after actual human children.</p>
<p>Further to that end, you can only have one pet at any given time via the mod, so if you want to replace your tamed Imp named Fatso with a brown bear named Bingus or a troll named Sapphire, you'll have to release the former back into the wild. As of right now, the mod has short lists of pre-defined names and recruitable animals for you to pick from, but ColdTyrant has indicated he's open to adding more options based on suggestions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the modder says he initially tried letting folks type in their own custom pet names, but had to ditch that option due to it being "literally impossible to rename an actor without clicking on them directly in the console" at the moment.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this Beast Master mod a go, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> are optional installs, but not hard requirements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade has finally launched, around thirteen months after the game's or<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iginal debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a>. This version is also published by Sony and as such, it's interesting to compare its early player figures against other recent Sony-published games that made it to the PC platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3489700/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already more than doubled any previous single player games published by Sony on Valve's store when it comes to concurrent user peak. The action title peaked at 183.8K players around nineteen hours ago, with the potential to go even higher as we head into the weekend, when gamers have more time to play.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/PlayStation+Publishing+LLC/?sort=peak_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> the previous record earlier this year with 77.1K, although it should be clarified that the game also includes a multiplayer coop mode, Legends. As such, it might be more appropriate to consider Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 73.5K players, the previous record holder. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered reached a peak of 66.4K players; Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition stopped at 56.5K, while its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, peaked at 40.4K players. The Last of Us Part I registered 36.4K concurrent players on Steam, narrowly beating God of War Ragnarok (35.6K), The Last of Us Part II Remastered (30.6K), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (28.1K), and Days Gone (27.4K). All the others are much lower in the chart. Interestingly, all the first installments registered higher peaks than their sequels.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is certainly an acclaimed title, having sold enough to warrant a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>. That said, some of the other games mentioned above have rated even higher, despite reaching lower concurrent players on Steam. This new record might be surpassed soon, though, as the next Sony-published PC game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, will release on the same day as on consoles (August 29). It will be the first single-player game published by Sony to launch day and date on PC, and that might be enough to raise interest in the game, provided that it reviews well enough.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will be updated sometime this month with "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords", but as is often the way of updates, some of the relevant boss files are already in the current version of the game, and yes, there's a mod if you want an early crack at them.</p><!--more-->
<p>From Software teased the coming of spruced-up boss battles in <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">a social media post</a> on 3rd June, offering no clue as to what "enhanced" means in this context. Enhanced movesets? Enhanced haircuts? An inflated sense of self-esteem?</p>
<p>Subsequently, owl-eared, eagle-eyed players noticed that there were unused sections in every boss soundtrack theme that implied the addition of a third combat phase, together with unused boss relics that look like a reward for besting them in hard mode. Now, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftware-left-hints-for-elden-ring-nightreigns-enhanced-bosses-update-in-the-files-and-modders-have-already-dug-them-up/">PCGamer</a>, NexusMods user TerraMag has dug up the files that let you fight the "enhanced" Nightlords and released them as the obliquely named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/92">Enhanced Nightlord Fights mod</a>.</p>
<p>If you lack the fortitude to face these maxed-out titans yourself, or you just want to chill to footage of an apoplectic gigaroach, TerraMag has kindly released some videos of the enhanced fights. Bear in mind, of course, that these aren't the final, From-sanctioned versions of each enhanced boss, so they might appear rough and unfinished. </p>

Xbox sales remain a mystery because Microsoft just doesn't talk about that sort of thing anymore, which is decidedly frustrating for those oddballs (read: this writer) who actually enjoy sifting through financial documents in search of those juicy juicy numbers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Inside the ‘Dragon Age’ Debacle That Gutted EA’s BioWare Studio"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio?embedded-checkout=true">Inside the ‘Dragon Age’ Debacle That Gutted EA’s BioWare Studio</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Bloomberg (paywalled) //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> How do you kill a franchise like Dragon Age and leave a studio with the pedigree of BioWare in turmoil?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft centric website Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the company had paused its work on the Xbox handheld project. This did not affect the partnership with ASUS to make the ROG X Ally and ROG X Ally X, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 for a holiday release window.</p>
<p>Originally, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to use this partnership as a stopgap while it produced its own Xbox handheld that would have been released alongside the next-generation Xbox home console. These plans, however, are more than just paused - they might be practically dead now, according to The Verge's Tom Warren. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>, Warren says that Microsoft will focus on the software platform instead. Furthermore, he points out that while there will be an 'official' next-generation hardware from Microsoft, OEM partners like ASUS may also release their own versions of a next-gen Xbox console.</p>
<p>In that regard, Warren believes that the ASUS-made handhelds are a sort of 'market test' for Microsoft's increasingly tight integration of Windows and Xbox, not to mention the ambitious goal of turning every screen into an Xbox. The Verge's journalist adds that, at some point, the emulation project established by Sarah Bond in early 2024 may solve the issue. Until then, Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming are doing most of the work in helping spread the brand across devices.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft has made some lofty promises when it comes to the next-generation console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that the successor of the Xbox Series X would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever seen' from one generation to another. That's certainly an ambitious goal that could possibly only be achieved through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, although we'll have to wait until Microsoft reveals its hand before assessing the veracity of that statement. The next Xbox is currently thought to be targeting a 2027 launch, presumably near the holiday season.</p>

			<p>After the news that Street Fighter 6 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 5 million units sold, CAPCOM has another sales milestone to announce this week, this time for Devil May Cry 5. The latest installment in the popular action game franchise has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million units since its debut on March 8, 2019, for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry 5 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-2019-devil-may-cry-5-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 2 million units in less than a month, but then sales slowed down considerably. It wasn't until April 2022 that CAPCOM could <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-over-5-million-units-globally-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the five million sales milestone. Notably, sales were at 9.1 million units as of March 31, 2025, meaning the game sold almost a million units in less than three months.</p>
<p>That's a lot for a relatively old game, but it's not impossible. For one thing, there was the acclaimed Netflix Devil May Cry show that certainly helped push game sales, too. CAPCOM says that with more than 5.3 million views, it ranked fourth globally in the 'Shows | English' category during its first week. It also ranked in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910766029376262605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise sale in April</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM is counting Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition separately. On its Platinum Titles chart, that version is listed as having sold 1 million units on its own, which means that DMC 5 as a whole has technically surpassed 11 million units.</p>
<p>DMC 5 earned high praise here on Wccftech from resident fan Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game 9.8 out of 10:</p>
<p>Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will "only" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.</p>

<p>Good form</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cd4707bfde1a1/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> launched for the Switch 2 last week and if you've been wanting to throw your support behind this particular version of the game, but aren't confident it will be supported on the same level as other platforms, we've got some good news.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jun/12/street-fighter-switch-2-tournament/">highlighted by EventHubs</a>, the Nintendo version has been declared tournament legal, which means the Switch 2 version is now officially acceptable for online and offline tournaments according to <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/cpt/rules/">Capcom's Pro Tour website</a>. This update originally came into effect on 9th June, just days after the release of the game on Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>While it might seem like this was always going to be the case, during past generations, certain third-party fighting games have isolated Nintendo builds – resulting in major updates and DLC at a later date. As the source notes, the Switch 2 version supports cross-play functionality (including Capcom's ID account system), which is a point of difference in this case, so it's "hardly a surprise".</p>
<p>Still, it's a nice contrast to some other fighting games on Nintendo platforms. For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> (which landed on the Switch earlier this year) is still yet to receive the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/guilty-gear-strive-adds-another-dlc-character-to-its-season-pass-4-roster">latest seasonal DLC fighters</a>. So, it's once again great news to see the Switch 2 version of Street Fighter 6 being treated equally.</p>
<p>You can find out our thoughts about this version of Street Fighter 6 in our full review here on Nintendo Life. In some related news, Capcom this week announced the lifetime sales of the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">have now surpassed the five million mark</a>.</p>

In this particular case, we're actually referring to Piggyback's upcoming art book '<strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>'.</p>
<p>This book, developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, was originally scheduled to launch in Summer 2025 and then <a href="https://x.com/PiggybackGuides/status/1894447510669705488">narrowed down the date to 24th June 2025</a>, but has now been pushed back to <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. <a href="https://www.piggyback.com/us/guide/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective/">Pre-orders have also gone live</a> since our last update.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>When this art book eventually releases, Metroid fans can look forward to a 212-page visual retrospective that goes behind the scenes on the series' development including a foreword by Metroid Prime producer Kensuke Tanabe.</p>
<p>This book will retail for <strong>£39.99 / €44.99</strong> and you can find out more about it in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, it's currently set to arrive at some point in 2025, with Nintendo also recently revealing a Switch 2 version which will enhance the experience and also add some additional features like mouse control.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Because I'm<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> now a normal person who reads about video game news much the same way most of you do</a>, did you know the first I even heard about the video game <em>MindsEye </em>was only a few days ago,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when I read that its creators had blamed negative pre-launch coverage on paid shills</a>? What an introduction!</p><p>Given how volatile the video game community is these days, and how easily vital parts of it (reviews, social media, etc) can be weaponised against developers, I felt a pang of sympathy for the team. We've all seen how chuds can bury a game without having even played it, and this sure sounded like another example of that happening.</p><p>WRONG. This game sucks, and everything bad that anyone has ever written about it, for free or otherwise, is true.</p><p>I've tried playing the game over the last few days and have hated every second I've spent with it. I can see the outline of what was attempted here--a cyberpunk <em>GTA </em>clone, something like <em>Watch Dogs</em> meets <em>2077</em>--but what's actually here is a buggy mess of a game that looks bland, is boring to play and perhaps worst of all seems to have treated its story and dialogue with open contempt.</p><p>Given <em>MindsEye</em>'s developer is led by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Benzies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> prominent ex-Rockstar man Leslie Benzies</a>, the <em>GTA </em>similarities are to be expected, but like...just watch this, the first real mission you have to undertake. It does everything a <em>GTA </em>game would do, in that it gives you a car, tells you to drive somewhere to shoot some bad guys then fills the downtime with dialogue, but every single aspect of it here is just <em>dreadful</em>, from the pathfinding (look how long it takes you to get to the car!) to the stilted delivery of some meaningless lines to the limp, wet gunplay.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MindsEye – First Hour Gameplay - No Commentary Walkthrough Part 1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2OGYUSIec8?start=2694&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I cannot <em>believe</em> how bad the writing and voice acting is in this game. Actually, let me be fair: I don't know if it's the acting itself, or just the way it's all been recorded and delivered in two-line packages, seemingly in isolation, meaning nothing ever sounds like it’s part of a natural, human conversation. I was only 20 minutes into this game before it started testing my patience; by the two-hour mark I was ready to mute it and just put subtitles on.</p><p>It’s like a <em>GTA</em> clone that was delivered by ticking boxes--cars, check; guns, check; cover system, check--without ever bothering to make sure if any of those boxes were any <em>good</em>. It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer. It plays like a cancelled PS4 game.</p><p>It's so bad that streamers<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/606496/mindseye-twitch-youtube-stream-cancel-glitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> are having their sponsored streams cancelled</a>. It's so bad that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-mindseye-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> seemingly no major outlets were sent review code ahead of time</a>. There are so many bugs and glitches that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1l8nl48/playstation_support_have_refunded_the_game_with/?share_id=3_-brSh2YLe4KNeaeC79I&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sony is reportedly offering at least this person a refund on technical grounds</a>, something it has only really done previously with <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p><p>Some of this can be chalked up to it being <em>really hard</em> to make a good open-world game, which is why the few studios who <em>can</em> do it get paid so much and can sell so many copies. Some of it can maybe be chalked up to the fact that developers Rocket Boy<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-rockstar-north-boss-nets-110m-to-launch-what-sounds-a-lot-like-a-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> originally had plans for <em>MindsEye </em>to be part of a big metaverse grift</a>, which might explain the presence of an odd and seemingly useless creation suite within the game.</p><figure></figure><p>Whatever the reasons, and whatever the original intent, this is a very bad video game that's bad in such fundamental ways I don't know if it can ever be fixed with a patch or two. It's buggy, sure, but it's also so drab and uninteresting and by-the-numbers that it just bums me out.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright"><h3>Disney’s Big AI Lawsuit Includes Some Very Damning Images</h3></a><p>Disney isn't the only one calling Midjourney a 'bottomless pit of plagiarism'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077. I spent a few days with CD Projekt Red’s latest port to get a feel for how it runs, how it holds up, and how the Switch 2’s fancy new mouse controls work when applied to a high-octane FPS. The answer across the board is impressive, and if you haven’t had the pleasure of exploring Night City before, this seems like a solid way to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, let’s look back at what I said in my review of Cyberpunk 2077 when it first launched in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that was just for the PC version, and the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions were such a notorious mess that we had to go back and do <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-for-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review"><u>a separate review</u></a> with a much lower score once we got our hands on it at launch. (And don’t forget we also reviewed its excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"><u>Phantom Liberty DLC</u></a> in 2023, which is included in the Switch 2 version.) Thankfully, the Switch 2 port is nowhere near the disaster it was on the old console generation – in fact, it’s pretty dang great.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty great on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All it takes is a quick glance to see that Cyberpunk 2077 still looks very good on Nintendo’s new console. The distinct neon glows and dirty streets of Night City all come through alive and well here, even if they aren’t quite as crisp and clean as you’d find on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X. This isn’t exactly the “definitive” way to play this game, but it’s more than good enough from a practical standpoint. This isn’t like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/14/witcher-3-switch-review"><u>Switch 1 port of The Witcher 3</u></a>, which felt like an “I guess we can make this function” sort of last resort way to play more than anything else. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The framerate is decent but not jaw-dropping</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You can check out the technical specs in our story about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2"><u>how CD Projekt managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2</u></a> – in short, it’s running at 1080p when docked, and 1080p or 720p in handheld, depending on if you’re playing in Quality or Performance mode, and it maxes out at 40fps. Your mileage may vary here, because despite my PC gaming background, I am not a huge performance snob and I have no issue playing at less than 60fps. So to my eye, Cyberpunk 2077 runs fairly well in docked mode, even if far from perfect. It has some dropped frames in parts and doesn’t run as buttery smooth as the Switch 2 Editions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update"><u>Tears of the Kingdom</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update"><u>Breath of the Wild</u></a>, but nothing is so distracting that it actively harmed my time with it in this context. If you can’t stand anything below a solid 60fps, this might be one you need to skip – anyone who is used to playing games entirely on the original Switch, however, should be comfortable enough here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Switch 2 mouse controls work surprisingly well</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest draws of the Switch 2 for me was its ability to mimic mouse control with a sideways Joy-Con, potentially giving you greater accuracy in a first-person game like this. I am happy to say that’s exactly the case, as it was super easy for me to jump from my PC to this control option and get far more headshots than I would have with a regular gamepad. It’s not at the same level as a high-DPS gaming mouse or anything, but it’s absolutely my preferred way to play this game whenever I sat down to do so, and that’s a huge win. That said…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Joy-Con mouse isn’t great for long sessions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, the problem with the Switch 2’s mouse mode isn’t actually the quality of the mouse control itself, but the physical feel of using it. The Joy-Con is tiny compared to a normal mouse, and my hand was cramping up trying to get a good grip on it after long play sessions – even when I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social/post/3lqvjiltnfk2j" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>used a 3D-printed shell</u></a> to make it feel better. That’s because there’s nowhere to comfortably put your thumb while still being able to press the right stick, Y button, and A button, all of which are required for various actions as you jump between combat, conversations, and menu management. So while the mouse is better than I expected, I’m worried this awkward grip is going to stop me from consistently using it in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077’s motion assist options aren’t great</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the mouse controls are at least better than using motions to shortcut certain actions. The usual method of aiming with the right stick primarily and then fine-tuning that aim with motion controls is available and works just as well here as it does in stuff like Zelda, but the motion assist options are pretty useless beyond that. You can swing your Joy-Con to use your melee weapon in a way that gave me unflattering flashbacks to early Wii games, or twist and flail it to do actions like reload or heal, but doing so almost always made my camera wobble about at the same time. It may hurt my hand, but I’ll take mouse controls over this any day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">This is still an awesome RPG worth playing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, revisiting Night City reminded me just how great this game is, especially after all the improvements after launch. The world is moody and dangerous, and it does a great job of dropping you in and immediately making you feel like a part of the culture. I also maintain it stages its quest conversations better than any RPG I’ve ever seen, giving simple chats a cinematic quality without ever taking you out of the driver seat.

<p>Breaking records in less than a week</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a6181ef1adbe/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo shared its first official sales data for the Switch 2 – confirming the new hybrid system had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide"</a> in just the first four days, making it the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware within this amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the video game firm has revealed this new device is also the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware in the US" in four days. This was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">reported by IGN</a> – with the outlet also told "Switch 2 sales in all regions were approximately twice those of the Nintendo Switch 1 across both consoles' first four days on the market". Nintendo has not provided specific sales figures for this region.</p>
<p>This follows reports about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">system's positive start in locations like the UK</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">and Japan</a>. Unsurprisingly, the launch is also benefiting certain franchises such as Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which has now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">surpassed five million lifetime sales</a> just a week later.</p>
<p>It's still early days for the Switch 2, and there were obviously some concerns about pricing and supply in the lead-up, but based on the official sales updates so far, it appears to be an excellent start. Nintendo will bolster the new device's software library next month with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and it's likely to welcome even more consumers to the Switch 2 family with games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> later this year.</p>
