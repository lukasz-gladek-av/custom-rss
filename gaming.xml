			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI doesn't need another trailer to get people excited about the game. On the contrary, the element of surprise would make its launch an even bigger success, according to a former Rockstar Games developer.</p>
<p>As part of a social media celebration of the 17th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto IV, which includes some interesting insights on the lead platform, which was the Xbox 360 due to how difficult it was to develop on PlayStation 3, and how the decision to delay the game to April 29th, 2008 was made four months before the original October 16th 2007 release date, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij commented on how they would handle Grand Theft Auto VI marketing cycle, saying that, if it were their call to make, they wouldn't release any additional trailer. There's already plenty of excitement for the game's release, and the element of surprise would make the release bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Also:<br>
If it was my call I wouldn’t release any additional trailers.<br>
There is more than enough hype around VI and the element of surprise is going to make the release only bigger as an event.</p>
<p>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1917025732074655981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After releasing the game's announcement trailer in late 2023, Rockstar Games hasn't talked much about Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite the silence on the game, however, Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">reiterated</a> back in February that the game is still scheduled to release this Fall to contribute, together with Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, to what is shaping up one of the strongest ever for the publisher, though it could have been even stronger if the game launched on PC at the same time as console.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen much of Grand Theft Auto VI in action, the recent release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition</a> on PC allowed us to get some sort of preview of the tech that will power the visuals of the next entry in the series. From some tests, however, it's clear how the game will likely target 30 FPS on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as CPUs on par with those powering the current generation of consoles struggle to handle the game properly at above 30 frames per second.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-story-is-absorbing-but-dont-miss-its-challenging-endgame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 side content. It does not spoil the main story. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its astonishing, utterly absorbing story, I found little time for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s side content. For two dozen hours I stayed true to the mission and pushed onwards towards my goal of defeating The Paintress. Not that I could see much else to do; optional regions and objectives seemed few and far between. But upon reaching the final phase of the story, in which you unlock the ability to fly around the overworld map, my assumption about side content was proven totally wrong. This world is so much bigger and more impressive than I realised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soar up into the clouds and you’ll find scattered floating islands, each one home to the likes of a gladiatorial arena, casino, crimson forest, or something stranger. Push beyond the boundaries of the main continent and you’ll discover hidden doors, wild platforming challenges, and elaborate mazes. And, deep below the ocean surface, there’s the hardest boss of them all. Yes, there’s what seems like an entire other game beyond the main path, much of which is designed to be Expedition 33’s endgame. Clair Obscur isn’t solely a story-focused experience, at least not for those who dare to continue. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/clair-obscur-expedition-88-serpenphare-1745922186325.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">High above the world map is one of Clair Obscur's most challenging foes. | Image credit: Sandfall Interactive / Kepler</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Sandfall Interactive has taken an economical approach to side quests (understandable, considering the studio's small size.) You won’t find any of the sprawling side stories that make games like The Witcher 3 so beloved. Most of the optional regions are small – some are even a single ‘room’ viewed from a static camera, designed to evoke the pre-rendered backdrops of PS1-era Final Fantasy more than offer any kind of exploration value. For the story-hungry, there’s precious little beyond the dozens of Journals that recount the trials of failed expeditions before you. Small but nonetheless interesting lore drops (such as, for instance, the origin of the Nevron enemies you face throughout the story) do, on occasion, make the side content narratively richer, but this is not a pursuit for anyone expecting the same grand story ambition as seen in the main quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Expedition 33’s MO for side content is gameplay-driven. But while it’s all built on the same core concepts as the main campaign – simple exploration, turn-based combat encounters, and character buildcrafting – the activities available certainly have a very different flavour. For the most part, it's all designed to push those foundational ideas as far as they can possibly go. Exploration becomes trickier thanks to labyrinthine environments that require puzzle solving to progress, while incredibly powerful bosses demand both full mastery of the combat system and deep understanding of how to assemble your characters' stats, abilities, and equipment. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’re a fan of the Japanese RPG grind, you’ll be in perfect territory here. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As with the main story, there’s space made for both the enigmatic and eccentric. Random doors found in both levels and the overworld will transport you to the Manor, a grand house filled with locked rooms. Each new door found breaks the seal on one of those rooms, granting access to the collectables inside. Opening up the whole house is naturally the goal, but there’s more hiding within its halls. A series of secret levers in the dining hall triggers moving architecture, which not only grants access to a hidden passageway, but also suggests there’s more concealed in the Manor than it first seems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stranger still are the Gestral-populated regions, where sentient paintbrush-like creatures ask you to solve quirkier problems. At the Flying Casino, for instance, a Gestral holed up inside refuses to speak to any human – overcome that issue and you’ll be rewarded with one of the more humorous costume options. Similarly, heading to the Gestral beaches will see you rewarded with swimsuits for your team (sure to become “fan favourites”, I’m sure), but you’ll need to succeed at a bit of running and jumping to net them. Some of the time that’s reasonably easy – a race through a basic obstacle course, for instance. But one beach asks you to climb an impossibly tall tower of precariously balanced junk, a feat that demands patient and precise platforming, not least because a single slip-up sends you right back to the start. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/clair-obscur-expedition-88-casino-1745922206791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Flying Casino is one of Expedition 33's more eccentric pieces of side content. | Image credit: Sandfall Interactive / Kepler</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combining ideas from those aforementioned regions is the Painting Workshop. A monochrome realm hanging within an abyss, you must carefully navigate its pathways made of canvases and picture frames in order to approach an ominous sculpture. Finding the Workshop’s multiple entrances in the overworld will allow you to complete the sculpture and trigger a boss fight against the Lampmaster, a horrifying mass of arms, lamps, and a huge sword that requires you to solve a light puzzle between combat rounds. You fought this monstrosity much earlier in the game, but this version is substantially harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That difficulty doesn’t just apply to the Lampmaster – it affects Expedition 33’s side content almost universally. Abandoning the beaten path early on only to discover a boss clearly designed for the endgame is one thing, but it's another to arrive at the endgame and still feel totally underprepared. It quickly becomes clear that high-level challenge is very much the philosophy by which many of the activities live by. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>High-level challenge is very much the philosophy by which many of the endgame activities live by.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Gestalt Arena and the Endless Tower are classic JRPG-style battle gauntlets, asking you to succeed through a number of increasingly difficult fights. Meanwhile, lurking around the overworld are a variety of incredibly powerful adversaries, such as the ethereal Serpenphare floating around the sky islands to the north, or the titan-like Sprong that wades through the ocean. Even after you break through the 9,999 damage limit, inflicting pain on these creatures demands incredible skill and persistence. There’s no cheat code to bypass this – dropping down to story mode difficulty does little to augment your chances against them. These bosses demand that you put in the effort to train, improve, and refine your characters. In many instances, you’ll need to respec and reconfigure your team in order to focus on a boss’s weakness and bolster your defences against its specific attacks (suddenly it makes sense why you pick up so much respec currency during the campaign). If you’re a fan of the Japanese RPG grind, you’ll be in perfect territory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of this, Clair Obscur’s endgame feels very much like its own experience, rather than the more typical “mopping up” of side quests that happens in an RPG’s twilight hours. I may have started my journey through it at level 50, but that’s effectively level 0 when it comes to the challenges that await. My approach has been to return to the campaign’s starting point and systematically complete each optional area I missed or avoided, which has created a more approachable challenge gradient. What was once a near-impossible task, marked with red “DANGER” text on the UI, is now an easily surmountable one. Completing challenges in this order will help elevate me to the right levels needed to take on the endgame’s true trial; another major boss who lurks deep beneath the ocean within the pages of Renoir’s Drafts. From what I understand, you need a party of level 90 characters to stand a chance against him. Right now, reasonably fresh out of the story’s finale, it feels like there’s a whole second game between me and it.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I emerged into Expedition 33’s endgame, I was struck by the same feeling I had when I dived into the Depths that hide beneath The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Hyrule. All those sky islands, all those new lands, and all those ocean whirlpools signalled a wealth of extra things to do. I was also transported right back to my youth, when defeating Sephiroth was far from the conclusion of Final Fantasy 7 for me. Clair Obscur has its own versions of the Emerald and Ruby weapons, the Gold Saucer Battle Square, plus several of its own ideas on top. If you’ve truly fallen for Expedition 33, especially the combat and RPG stats side of things, then its side content and challenging endgame are an absolute must.

            <p>Nvidia have released the latest in an unusually frequent series of GeForce driver hotfixes, with the vast majority of identified issues affecting the newest RTX 50 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> specifically. <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">GeForce Hotfix Display Driver version 576.26</a> targets various crashing and flickering problems with, among others, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> – though it’s the growing regularity of these patch jobs that’s more disquieting than any particular instance of game breakage.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While driver hotfixes have been rare during previous GeForce generations, a recent flurry has seen them averaging about one every two weeks, from the 572.24 hotfix for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> startup crash on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> to the black screen scourge of 572.75, and now both the 576.15 and bumper-size 576.26 versions being deployed within the same day. Peering through their patch notes reveals that by far the most common thread is the RTX 50 series, which is hardly a ringing endorsement of their software stability.</p>
<p>I should say that I haven’t experienced any such problems myself while reviewing these cards, which performance-wise, range from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">pretty decent</a> to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">enormously disappointing</a>. Still, I am but one hardware editor, and even the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/564309/announcing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57626-released-42/">Nvidia forum post</a> announcing the latest hotfix leads into a raft of community replies reporting various continuing problems. Driver version 576.02, the most recent stable driver, is repeatedly identified as a breaking point, and with two hotfixes having now been sticky-plastered on top of it, the accusation carries some weight.</p>
<p>It's true that 'stable' drivers are faced with potentially meddlesome time restraints, as they’re usually released in support of either key new games or a new piece of hardware (the RTX 5060 Ti, in 576.02’s case). Still, that’s been the case with GeForce drivers for donkeys’ ages, so can’t really shoulder the blame for the sudden uptick in problems and resultant hotfixes. In any case, if you’ve been having hiccups with your own GeForce GPU, <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">give version 576.26 a download</a> and hope you won’t need another one for a while. It’ll need to be a manual installation, as hotfixes aren’t released through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a> like stable drivers are.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As Ed said in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-fresh-look-at-chinese-fantasy-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers should not be confused with Black Myth: Wukong, Phantom Blade Zero, Where Winds Meet</a>, or any other Chinese-set Wuxia-influenced action games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Composer Grant Kirkhope has shed light on why he wasn't credited by Nintendo in the Super Mario Bros. Movie for the inclusion of his DK Rap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2023 after the film's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-rap-composer-criticises-mario-movie-for-not-crediting-him">Kirkhope shared his frustration on social media</a>, calling the decision "fucking depressing". Other pieces of licensed music were fully credited.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Kirkhope explained how he spoke with Nintendo after the film's release but the company made the decision to not credit any music it owns - including the DK Rap.</p>

<p>"I did have communication with Nintendo as I wanted to find out why they just didn't put my name on it," said Kirkhope.</p>
<p>"They said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo. Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
<p>Bowser's Fury, another song used in the film but also owned by Nintendo, was likewise not credited.</p>
<p>Kirkhope heard from attendees of test screenings the DK Rap had been included, but he had assumed it was just test music and would be removed.</p>
<p>He added: "It's bizarre how they just sampled it straight from the game. They just plugged in the N64 and sampled it and looped it. There's no re-recording done, straight out the game. So it's me playing guitar on it. It's the lads from Rare doing the [sings] 'D-K' thing. They're all the performers on the track. So they're all in the movie uncredited."</p>
<p>So if Nintendo owns the rights to the DK Rap, does that mean we could see it added to the Nintendo Music App anytime soon?</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Kirkhope. "They have put some of Dave's [David Wise] stuff on it. They do own it all so it's up to them. I don't think they ever really liked DK 64 that much. That's a rumour we got back through the cycle of whispers from Nintendo when we were at Rare. I don't know if that's true or not."</p>
<p>It's certainly notable that Donkey Kong 64 is one of the few games from the N64 not included on the Switch Online collection.</p>
<p>Still, it appears the theme of Rambi the rhinoceros will be in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, as a post in the Nintendo Today app suggests. Kirkhope himself replied on social media: "Well fancy that...Rambi lives."</p> <div>

The <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">576.26 hotfix driver</a> is based on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready">576.02 driver release</a> earlier this month, which itself included a large amount of fixes for bugs and crashes.</p><p>This latest hotfix driver includes all the fixes in the 576.15 hotfix that was released last week, including a fix for the newly introduced <a href="http://GPU temperature bug">GPU temperature bug</a>. It also addresses flickering issues in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, track corruption on <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> randomly crashing on RTX 50-series cards. There are a variety of fixes for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Dead Island 2</em>, and <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> on RTX 50-series GPUs, too.</p><p>Nvidia has also included yet another supposed fix for black screen issues plaguing a range of LG monitors when using DisplayPort 2.1 mode. There’s also a fix for “grey screen crashes with multiple monitors” and “momentary display flicker occurs when running in DisplayPort2.1 mode with a high refresh rate” on RTX 50-series cards.</p><p>This is the fifth time Nvidia has released a hotfix driver over the past couple of months, which is a highly unusual amount and speaks to the persistent bugs and crashes that Nvidia GPU users have been reporting since the release of the RTX 50-series in January. I wrote last week that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/653115/nvidia-gpu-drivers-black-screen-crashes-issues">Nvidia’s GPU drivers are a mess</a>, and just a week later we already have another hotfix that attempts to address the latest problems.</p><p>It’s a far cry from three years ago when Nvidia was proudly boasting of its driver quality, and mocking AMD for releasing beta drivers. “We don’t release sub-par beta drivers with minimal testing, let alone multiple conflicting beta drivers forked from different development branches that support different games and products, which confuse customers,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgame-ready-driver-program-ultimate-gaming-platform%2F" rel="sponsored">said Nvidia</a> in April 2022.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>
Founded by Grzegorz "Greg" Styczeń, Slavic Magic have grown since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publisher-reassures-players-struggling-to-buy-at-launch-that-well-run-those-25-discounts-often">the absurd success of the early access release</a>. “Since launch we’ve welcomed Nathan (map design), Tom and Kurtis from Flix Interactive (programming), Niklas (AI), Basia (2D art), Nicolas (3D art), and Darren and James (game design). We’re also still working with QLOC for QA needs — and more folks are helping behind the scenes, such as Daniel,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/573753783490708647?l=english">a merry Steam post</a>, before unleashing a horde of suheadings that “is not a full changelog or final list”, but “should give you a good idea of where development is headed.”  
</p>
<p>
Let’s get stuck in, then. As regards new buildings, they’re working on a quarry for “endless” stone mining on rich deposits, and a lime kiln that will be required for advanced construction. Planned visual changes include revamps for the UI and map resource nodes, and some overhauled castle pieces. But the juiciest bits appear to involve the AI, which can now build and run a small village, making use of concepts such as burgage plots, backyard and living space extensions that didn’t exist in the early access launch version. 
</p>
<p>
“A lot of work was done to make sure the AI could use the plot tool properly,” the devs add. “We're still working on improving its city planning skills and will soon start working on its trading capabilities and farming.” Letting the AI build villages has also obliged a new approach to the game’s marketplace, though the Steam post doesn’t go into detail.
</p>
<p>
The devs are also making changes to the Record View, with a new screen for regional production and consumption. They’ve tweaked the approval system so that recent events have more impact than older events. And they’re working on a contentious-sounding upkeep system, “which means a smithy will need a constant flow of tools, and deep mines need a flow of planks”. It’s terrible to see the concept of “flow” invading the hitherto stolid pasture lands of the Middle Ages, but I do find the thought of planks cascading down a mineshaft sort of poetic.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the theme of flow, there’s a nice bit in the post that breaks down the appetisingly maddening challenge of having units pathfind through castles that have several floors. “The whole world in Manor Lords was always coded in 2D, which made collisions simpler to resolve and made the game more optimized,” Slavic Magic explain. “However, this meant we can't have "proper" gates where people stand on top and walk below at the same time (they'd collide with each other). 
</p>
<p>
“I decided to investigate this and rewrite the pathfinding to support multiple floors," the post goes on. "However, it's still being tested whether the extra computation cost is actually worth it (it's literally only for the gates, which in theory can be cheated by garrisoning in and out from the gatehouse doors).” Read the rest for a not very medieval, but undeniably cool development gif of militant rice grains struggling to escape a spiderweb of waypoints. 
</p>
<p>
Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-early-access-review">liked the original early access version of Manor Lords</a>, to the point that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">interviewed the composers</a> and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">stalked a cow for clicks</a>. Slavic Magic had planned to keep the game in early access for “around a year”, but it sounds like 1.0 is a ways off.

            <p>The Russian government has threatened to seize the assets of studios behind free-to-play tank battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World Of Tanks</a>, according to state media. Russia has accused the game companies' executives of "extremist activities" in relation to the war in Ukraine, although they provide no evidence in the legal action. The seizure casts a grim shadow over both Wargaming (the original developers of the game) and Lesta Games, a Moscow-based studio who were once owned by Wargaming and who took over the free-to-play game in Russian territories. It's Lesta Games who seem to be taking the brunt of the government hostility.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The assets of Lesta Games were subject to a "statement of claim" by Tagansky District Court of Moscow on April 17th, reports <a href="https://ria.ru/20250426/genprokuratura-2013563207.html">Russian media site RIA</a> (translated by Google). The prosecutor general names Lesta's executive Malik Khatazhaev as the target of the seizures, but also the owner of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly. Lesta have filed a complaint in return to challenge the decision.</p>
<p>"The company is working in full compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus," said the developer in a Telegram group, as <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/04/2025/680a30609a794772af778315">reported by RBC</a>. "So we have no grounds for any fears or concealment of information. We have not violated anything and we have nothing to fear."</p>
<p>To clear up any confusion, Wargaming are the original creators of the tank game - a studio that began life in Belarus but later grew to have studios across Europe, eventually heavily relocating their work to Cyprus. They bought the Russia-based studio Lesta Games in 2011. </p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2022. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Wargaming <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-tanks-studio-fires-creative-director-who-voiced-support-for-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">fired a creative director</a> who supported Russia's aggression and later announced they were<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wargaming-are-closing-their-studios-in-belarus-and-russia"> cutting ties with their Russian and Belarussian studios</a> and would no longer do business there. World Of Tanks was still playable in those regions, though, and became managed by Lesta Games, who once again became a legally independent business. </p>
<p>None of that distancing and repositioning seems to convince the Russian government, however. CEO of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly remains named by the prosecutor general as part of an "association carrying out extremist activities" and is therefore a target of asset seizure. The prosecutor's claim attached headlines from the media reporting World Of Tanks events that showed support for Ukraine by raising money for ambulances (you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXF43c5rpCE">a trailer for that event here</a>).</p>
<p>"Wargaming made a strategic exit from the Russian and Belarusian markets three years ago," said Wargaming in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/russia-moves-to-seize-world-of-tanks-developer-over-ukraine-support/">a response to VGC</a>. "The company disposed of its business in Russia and Belarus to the local management at zero cost and on a debt-free, cash-free basis, with no consideration to take it back. Wargaming doesn’t have any assets or business interests in Russia and Belarus."  </p>
<p>This isn't the first time Wargaming have been directly targeted by the Russian state for its sympathetic response to Ukraine. The company's chief business development officer was added to the country's terrorist watch list in 2023, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/belarusian-kgb-adds-world-of-tanks-studio-boss-to-terrorist-list/">PC Gamer report</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The voice artist behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Yennefer of Vengerberg has told Eurogamer that she doesn't know yet if her character will return in CD Projekt's in-development <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
Work on The Witcher 4 ramped up in earnest last November, following several years of pre-production. Now, over 400 staff at CD Projekt are assigned to the game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">though it won't launch until at least 2027</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, we already know the basics - that The Witcher 4 is a continuation of CD Projekt's existing trilogy, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">Ciri will now be its protagonist</a>, and that hero <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">Geralt has already been locked in as reappearing in some form, still voiced by Doug Cockle</a>.
</p>
<p>
But what about Yen? After Geralt and Ciri, sorceress Yennefer is arguably the next most important. Her relationship with Geralt is featured in numerous Witcher stories, and the character is also a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know any of this," claimed The Witcher 3's Yennefer, Denise Gough, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI_ObQcMOwv/?igsh=MWlrMWt3anFqZ21xbg==">when asked by my colleague Mat Jones</a> what she knew of CD Projekt's progress on The Witcher 4.
</p>
<p>
Gough - now starring in the Star Wars series Andor as Dedra Meero - went on to suggest she hadn't known what to expect when recording for The Witcher 3 years ago.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Eurogamer recently sat down with The Witcher 4's game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber</a> to try and tease some information about when the game will be set, and how much Geralt might appear.
</p>
<p>"Currently, he's having the best time of his life," Kalemba joked, when we asked whether Geralt would be back in action and playable at any point. "[He's] playing with some wine, and dealing with vineyards. This is where we left him last time. But obviously we can promise that Geralt will appear, but we cannot tell you if it's going to be playable or not right now. But yeah, he will appear. He's going to be present in The Witcher 4."</p>
<p>As for Netflix's TV adaptation, we just got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-peek-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-on-set-in-the-witcher-season-5">first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt</a> on set while filming its fifth season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The A Minecraft Movie team is leaning in - or trying to counteract - the viral rowdy cinema  behaviour memes by introducing sing-along 'Block Party Edition' screenings.</p>
<p>These screenings will allow you to burst forth with your best Lava Chicken recital, while being backed up by a fellow chorus of Steves all there for the same thing. Or, you know, you can just yell out "Chicken Jockey" at the top of your lungs. The A Minecraft Movie lot wants you to "meme" along with the film.</p>
<p>In the words of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures: "You know the moments. You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it’s time to get loose, laugh out loud and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan."</p>

<p>If this sounds like your thing, you can book tickets for A Minecraft Movie: Block Party Edition now, with the screenings themselves happening on 2nd May. Not all cinemas are participating, though, so you will need to check your local listings.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure exactly what I am talking about when I write words like "Chicken Jockey" or "Lava Chicken", well then truth be told I am a little jealous. My children know all about these memes already, and will periodically just come out with them in the middle of supper/homework/the night and so on. They haven't even seen the film…</p>
<p>Anyway, Chicken Jockey refers to a moment in the film where Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken. Jack Black's Steve then says "Chicken Jockey".</p>
<p>Now, that may not seem like much of A Moment to you or me, but a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when those words are spoken</a>. In fact, things got so chaotic, cinemas and Jack Black himself popped up asking people to dial it back.</p>
<p>In a clip shared on social media earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">Black stood up in front of a cinema telling those present "absolutely no 'chicken jockey'"</a>.</p>
<p>"Lava Chicken", meanwhile, is a little ditty sung in the film by Black's Steve, about what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft (it cooks).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lava Chicken entered the UK's official music chart, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the shortest ever entry in the official UK top 40</a>. The song itself is only 34 seconds long, and you can listen along below. </p>

            <p>A few years ago I found an old hardback tome of Solitaire rulesets on a garden wall. It was a bright, unambiguously pleasant day and I remember thinking 'oh, that's the wotsit that inspired those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-genteel-verdict-regency-solitaire">regency thingamajigs</a>'. So I took it home and tried my hand at a few variations, then forgot about the book entirely. After reading about Occlude, I can only wish my discovery had been more ominous, more foreboding. Why couldn't I have found the book in a secret cellar, its hastily painted-over entrance given away by the motion of air through a dream-catcher? Why couldn't it have been thrust upon me by a desperate man with hypnotic tattoos, pushed into my hands with a precautionary mutter to 'Ware The Onyx Triangle?'</p>
<p>This is the ambience cultivated by Occlude, a "single-player cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> card game for the terminally curious", in which Solitaire is the basis for seven rituals involving Tarot cards, which steadily unlock access to an archive of fragmentary lore. Here's a trailer.<!--more--></p>

<p>I did enjoy my initial experiments with Actual Cardboard Solitaire. I've already forgotten the rules I picked up from that book, but I remember the gentle buzz of unhurried meticulousness, the satisfaction of stacks forming before me, and the sense of fathomless arithmetic at play beneath the table surface. It sounds like Occlude will be a touch more... agitating, partly because it could be an inventory of your character's awful past. </p>
<p>"Have you ever done something you regret?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547010/Occlude/">the Steam page</a> asks. "What if I told you there was a way to fix it? Make it so that something never happened at all; or perhaps, just happened differently. What if I told you it was as simple as a game of solitaire?"</p>
<p>The developers are Tributary Games, creators of political sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-the-castle">King Of The Castle</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-can-scheme-against-you-in-political-sim-king-of-the-castle">Kaan rather liked</a>. Occlude is "smaller and tighter than KOTC, but just as ambitious," the developers add in the announcement post. "It's Solitaire, yes, but much, much more. It's got puzzle mechanics, and a mind-bending narrative that's a puzzle in it's own right. It's a game that is one thing but also another."</p>
<p>I mean, I could say the same thing of my breakfast today - a peanut butter and jam sandwich. But I do respect the desire to take Solitaire and futz around with the workings via hearty injections of, in this case, "Lynchian horror".</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but Tributary are running some kind of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3547010/view/505075100350939381?l=english">marketing conspiracy game</a> if you want to get an early taste of the setting. Me, I'm off to dig out that Solitaire rulebook in the hopes that there's, for example, a diagram of a strange and frightening constellation inside the dust jacket.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Japanese developer PlatinumGames went through a rough patch with the launch of Babylon's Fall. The game published by Square Enix was the studio's first attempt at a live service title and it failed spectacularly, to say the least.</p>
<p>Despite a potentially intriguing setting, the execution was severely lacking, leading to poor critic reviews and <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-reaches-zero-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely low player numbers</a>. Francesco De Meo opined that a lot of the problems <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-babylons-fall-truly-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do with monetization</a>:</p>
<p><em>Where the monetization, Battle Passes, and GaaS features have impacted the game the most, in my opinion, is where it mattered the most in a PlatinumGames action title: combat mechanics. At the end of the main campaign, it becomes possible to change each weapon's attack mode to Power and Technical Mode, with the latter essentially making the game feel more in line with other, better games by PlatinumGames. Additional mechanics unlocked during the campaign itself, such as elemental attacks and properties and the Gideon Coffin mechanics, also make combat considerably more fun than at the start of the campaign. Later quests also feature a much better design, with different traps, light platforming, and more varied combat scenarios. Also, the endgame, although not much different in terms of game flow from the main campaign, is considerably more fun than the base campaign, and it is much easier to find players for stuff like Sieges and so on, better executing the multiplayer action game premise of the experience.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that it is clear that all these features and mechanics have been held back on purpose only to retain players and potentially make them buy future Battle Passes and premium currency. If the best-designed quests and advanced game mechanics would have been made available earlier, would the game have been received slightly better? I definitely think so. The game wouldn't have scored 7s or 8s all around, no question about it, but more reasonable 5s and 6s.</em></p>
<p>Babylon's Fall live servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went down for good</a> on February 27, 2023, less than a year after the game's launch. However, the Japanese developer still plans to work in the live service genre. As first <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/platinumgames-new-online-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by TechGamers</a>, they are <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/platinumgames/jobs/1-01-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> a Game Designer whose desired skills must include 'Experience working on online action game development' and 'Experience in level design for online or open field games'. Of course, it is possible that the studio would use Babylon's Fall learnings to make a much better live service product this time. At this stage, it is unclear whether this will be self-published or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on the single player action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which will be released later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>

From a wide variety of manga to lore encyclopedias, these books make the perfect gift for the Zelda fanatic in your life. Or if you just wanted to spruce up your own bookshelf, we got you covered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-april-2025">Amazon's April book sale</a> might be over, but many of these are still available at a discount for the foreseeable future and make for great gifts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Manga</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Himekawa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira Himekawa</a>, the Legend of Zelda manga span almost the entire history of the games, with major manga series based on many of the mainline titles like Ocarina of Time and the Minish Cap. These are great for people new to manga wanting to dip their toes in, or die-hard fans of the games looking for deeper world building. All of these stories are available individually, but if you're a collector, you can get some of them in various collected box sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 11 volume Twilight Princess Manga has its own boxed set, which includes the complete story and a poster. Additionally, the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past manga by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotaro_Ishinomori" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shotaro Ishinomori</a> is a great quick read that's also available. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedias</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in the mood for something a little more educational, the Legend of Zelda encyclopedias are the perfect place to get a deep dive into Hyrule's lore, culture, and different races. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/09/the-legend-of-zelda-hyrule-historia-review">The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia</a> originally released in 2013 and gave fans the first officially established timeline. If you're unfamiliar, for years fans have meticulously speculated about a branching timeline that began in Ocarina of Time — one branch where adult Link defeats Ganondorf and one where he doesn't. It's a pretty interesting bit of lore that explains some of the settings in later and past games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia and Art &amp; Artifacts offer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/20-fascinating-facts-from-the-legend-of-zelda-encyclopedia">even deeper looks at the universe</a>, and include detailed breakdowns of the different items, characters, and enemies, as well as exclusive interviews with developers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion is an over 400 page companion to the 2017 game.

        <blockquote><p><em>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers</em> is a Soulslike action RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty, plagued with warring factions and a mysterious illness spawning monstrous creatures.</p><p>Become Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior struck by amnesia, who must navigate the uncertainties of her mysterious past while afflicted by the horrific Feathering disease. Explore the depths of Shu, enhancing your arsenal and mastering new skills harvested from fallen foes. Evolve your fighting style by sacrificing elusive Red Mercury and further develop new techniques obtained throughout your action-packed journey. Augment the weapons in your repertoire with powerful enchantments, allowing for a unique approach to combat and strategy that suits your personal style.</p><p>Battle against grotesque abominations, drawing on ancient lore to challenge the creeping darkness that threatens the humanity that remains. Your quest for truth will take you through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins, and shadowed paths fraught with peril. As you piece together Wuchang’s lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings—each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust.</p><p>Immerse yourself in a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and breathtaking visuals that offer an unforgettable adventure through lands veiled in chaos and death. Will you reveal the truths of Wuchang’s curse and bring peace to Shu, or will you succumb to the encroaching horrors? The fate of the land rests in your hands.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

Additionally, the suit challenges the two companies' messaging on user safety, implying they knowingly make promises they can't keep.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This case, filed on April 21, 2025, accuses the two companies of "facilitating the sexual exploitation" of the plaintiff as the direct result of lax safety standards and misrepresentation of safety protocols to parents. It follows years of investigations about the risks of child sexual abuse on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and details how the failings reported in those investigations may have contributed to the harm of the minor.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/journey-and-sky-dev-thatgamecompany-announces-game-jam-with-10-000-in-prizes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Journey developer thatgamecompany to co-host game jam with $10,000 prize pool</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/parents-sue-i-roblox-i-for-allegedly-hosting-child-grooming-sexual-content">Roblox has faced lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over child safety in the past, but this appears to be the first lawsuit that levies accusations on both Roblox and Discord. According to the lawsuit, Doe's parents became aware she was being sexually exploited by an individual described in the lawsuit as a "known predator" through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord in 2022. That individual allegedly targeted her through two games within the wider </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ecosystem, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mic Up</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Write A Letter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and was able to send her messages through the "whisper" function even though her Roblox account "clearly displayed" she was a minor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In time, the plaintiff was convinced to share her Discord username with the accused predator, leading to conversations on the popular chat platform where she was then coerced into sending sexually explicit images. These events took place over the course of six months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the lawsuit, Doe's parents were aware of the safety tools and resources intended to keep minors safe on Roblox but allege that the materials fall short. The lawsuit accuses both companies of failing to implement strong safety procedures and, beyond that, of misrepresenting the safety of their platforms to parents in order to maximize revenue, specifically describing how the plaintiff's father reviewed the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Parent's Guide before letting her use the platform and allowing her to play online. Following the incident and after her father blocked her from accessing Discord and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the plaintiff reportedly attempted suicide.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/io-interactive-co-founder-launches-new-studio-unveils-first-project-for-summer-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">IO Interactive co-founder launches new 'consensus'-driven studio</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Are ">Are <span>Roblox</span> and Discord as safe as they claim?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit filed against Roblox</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and Discord dedicates several pages to the claims both companies have previously made about safety on each of their platforms, going as far as to call out executives like Roblox Corporation CEO David Baszucki by name for statements made to the press. Roblox</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">vice president of civility &amp; partnerships Tami Bhaumik is likewise singled out for comments made in 2024 to Parents Magazine that state the company has "a responsibility to make sure players can learn, create, and play safely. This continues to be our most important priority and that will never change."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Comments from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman are spotlighted as well, with Kaufman previously telling NPR that "any time anything happens to a child that puts them at risk is one [time] too many." The lawsuit positions these statements alongside contrasting documented allegations of sexually abusive activity that have allegedly taken place on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-report-inflated-user-numbers-child-predator-presence-investors">including a recent report by Hindenberg Research</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> scrutinizing a number of games on the platform that mimicked the alleged sexual abuse of music mogul P.

The company is criticized for making several of its default safety features "opt-in" instead of "opt-out", with the suit also arguing that embedded Discord features on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> platform further facilitates abuse across both platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit suggests that both companies could improve safety by improving age verification to prevent underage users from creating accounts without their parents' permission and requiring users to provide real names when registering for an account. Discord is specifically criticized for not allowing family-connected account admins to have access to the contents of messages for children's accounts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combined, the criticisms against </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord are pertinent to the personal experience described by the plaintiff, who is now asking for a jury to weigh in on the years-long contention that popular online platforms are not doing enough to protect children. The outcome could decide the fate of both companies, and have implications for other companies making online games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Roblox Corporation and Discord for comment and will update this story when a response is issued.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Developer Larian Studios has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">officially bid a fond farewell to Baldur's Gate 3</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">April's massive Update 8 patch</a>, and with the team now focusing on the future, company boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more on why it ultimately decided against releasing a paid DLC expansion for the acclaimed RPG, calling it the "boring" option.
</p>
<p>
Vincke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-director-hasnt-completely-ruled-out-dlc">first addressed the idea of Baldur's Gate 3 DLC</a> all the way back in September 2023, around a month after the game had launched to a stellar critical and commercial reception. At the time, he said building on the base game would be "very hard" for the team, but "not undoable". But just five months later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">all fan hopes for DLC were dashed</a> when Vincke confirmed the studio was "gonna move on", meaning no DLC and no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4. "We are not a company that's made to create DLCs, expansions," he explained. "We tried that actually, a few times. We failed every time - it's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large."
</p>
<p>
And now, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">new interview with Game Spot</a>, Vincke has turned to the topic of DLC once more. When asked why Larian had ultimately opted against creating DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> despite it being such a massive success, he replied, "It's boring, is really the honest answer. We tried to be in the DLC business, talked about that with BG3... there's just no passion... I mean happy player, happy business, but you also need a happy developer for a happy player. What we're doing now makes developers way more happy."

<p>
"We heard it's what we were supposed to do, right? You've got a huge game, a huge hit, and you've gotta make DLC this and DLC that and DLC there... and money's gonna pile up all high! And we just nodded and said, 'Yeah we'll make DLCs'. And then the moment that we had some time to think, we realised, 'What are you doing?'. Progressive insight is not a bad thing, so sometimes you go down the wrong path and then say, 'Oh fuck it', and just change course."
</p>
<p>
As for what Larian is doing now Baldur's Gate 3 is mostly all wrapped up (minus any lingering bug fixes), that remains a mystery. All Vincke would say during his Game Spot interview is that the studio is now "deep in the trenches" of its "next big thing" - a "crazy ambitious" project that's "shaping up quite well". And, of course, it's not the only thing Larian is working on, with Vincke having previously confirmed preparation for a second project is also underway. This, he admitted, is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/">Larian Studios</a> boss Swen Vincke shared some of his thoughts on generative AI technology in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">GameSpot</a>. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-fears-that-50-years-from-now-generative-ai-tech-will-replace-game-creators/">other major creators</a> are concerned the technology could eventually replace humans, Vincke doesn't necessarily share that concern.</p>
<p>It's not that Vincke is entirely against using AI and even generative AI in development for Larian Studios. He understands that it could eventually make a developer's work go faster, but he stops short of saying that it would actually make developing a game take less time.</p>
<p>"<em>I think the naive thing is to think that it will shorten them [development times]. I think that it's an age old truth, if you give a developer two years, they're going to take three. The same thing will be the case here, with what you're going to give them in terms of abilities to do stuff . If they have the ability to do things faster, they'll just do more, which is actually what you want.</em>"</p>
<p>But when it comes to the question of humans being replaced by generative AI technology just generating whole sections of games or entire games even to ship, Vincke doesn't think that'll happen. Nor does he think it's advisable to operate in that way, where generative AI is doing everything for you.</p>
<p>"<em>I don't think you would have a competitive advantage if you do, because that is what's going to be available to everybody, right,</em>" Vincke said.</p>
<p>"<em>If the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody, fine, that's a new reality that we're in. But you're still going to want to create something special on top of that. I think that's where teams like us will make a difference, we're a very boutique team. We're actually crafting the situations and the flow of the story by hand, it's a thing that we do.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>When we talk to people about it, this is always the discussion. 'Oh my god, our jobs are going to disappear,' and, no, but you're just going to work differently, potentially. But you're still going to be making a difference</em>."</p>
