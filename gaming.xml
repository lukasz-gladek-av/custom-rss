            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wiring outdoor security cameras means drilling through walls, fishing cables through attics, hiring electricians and accepting permanent placement decisions you’ll regret six months later when you realize the angle is wrong. The <strong>Eufy security SoloCam S220</strong> solves all of that with a completely wireless design powered by a built-in solar panel that keeps itself charged indefinitely.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/">dropped it to an all-time low of $59 after applying both the automatic 35% discount and an additional on-page coupon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. For homeowners tired of package thieves, this represents the easiest path to outdoor surveillance that actually works.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The solar charging eliminates the largest headache with wireless cameras: battery anxiety. Older battery-powered wireless cameras must be recharged every few weeks or even months, requiring you to pull out ladders and break up coverage precisely when coverage is needed most. The <strong>unit power is fueled with only three hours of sunlight per day to keep it fully charged indefinitely</strong>. The <strong>built-in solar panel is flush-mounted</strong> on top of the camera enclosure so that no separate panel is needed to be mounted and no wires are needed to be run between modules. Even during short winter days when sunlight is scarce, the capacity of the battery reserves is enough to sustain recording through several weeks’ worth of cloudiness without maintenance.</p>
<h2>2K Resolution</h2>
<p>Video resolution is a direct factor in whether content is functional or simply for ornamentation’s sake. The <strong>2K resolution used here equates to 2304 x 1296 pixels</strong>, much clearer than 1080p standard-resolution cameras which top out at 1920 x 1080. The increased resolution means you can indeed <strong>read license plates from 20 feet distant</strong> or make out facial features well enough for police purposes.</p>



<p>The f/1.6 aperture owes more to image quality than most spec sheets describe. Aperture determines how much light reaches the sensor, with lower numbers meaning more light reaches it. An f/1.6 specification is outstanding for security webcams, which are usually around f/2.0 or larger. This larger aperture paired with infrared LEDs provides<strong> valuable night vision that reveals detail in almost complete darkness</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>AI detection system</strong> differentiates this from ordinary motion-activated cameras that buzz your phone every time a leaf moves by. The onboard processor interprets patterns of movement to differentiate humans from animals, cars, and natural movement such as swaying branches. You are only alerted when real people come into view, minimizing notification fatigue significantly. The camera is connected to Eufy’s HomeBase 3 hub for advanced facial tracking that can distinguish between your family members, regular package deliverers, and unfamiliar guests, although the camera operates fully without the hub on standard human detection.</p>



<p><strong>Installation requires approximately 15 minutes overall</strong>. The miniature housing is approximately 3 inches in diameter, small enough to be installed inconspically under eaves or on fence posts without appearing to be overt surveillance gear. Since it’s wire-free, you drill a single mounting hole, place the supplied anchor, and twist on the camera itself. The magnetic base lets you make angle adjustments without tools so that you can tweak your view after reviewing initial coverage.</p>
<p>Both discounts applied at $59 means you are paying well under many indoor cams but receive weatherproof build rated for outdoor use, solar charging which means no maintenance needed, and AI detection that works.</p>

                <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is launching an investigation into developer Roblox Corporation, alleging that the online game creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is a "breeding ground" for predators that enables child abuse.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-issues-criminal-subpoenas-roblox-protect-children" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a press release</a> from the Republican's office, Uthmeier said he and his team will be issuing Roblox Corporation "criminal subpoenas" for "profiting off of our kids and exposing them to the most dangerous of harms." This investigation will allow Uthmeier to determine whether the company's action or inaction aids child abuse.</p><p>"Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids," Uthmeier said in an October 20 video posted to X. "These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on the Roblox platform, as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are issuing criminal subpoenas to Roblox, which has become a breeding ground for predators to gain access to our kids. <a href="https://t.co/vcyTVnkrxU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/vcyTVnkrxU</a></p>  — Attorney General James Uthmeier (@AGJamesUthmeier) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Roblox has faced scrutiny over its child safety, particularly <span>following <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" rel="nofollow ">a</a></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> June 2024 Bloomberg report</a> that found the platform has a rampant pedophile problem. AGs Russell Coleman (R-Kentucky) and Liz Murrill (R-Louisiana) have issued lawsuits against Roblox for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/kentucky-lawsuit-roblox-fails-protect-children-popular-online-126310412" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">failing to protect children</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/louisiana-sues-roblox-over-child-safety-concerns" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">facilitating the distribution of child sexual abuse material</a>. Meanwhile, two other lawsuits--<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roblox-online-gaming-giant-child-predator-allegations-lawsuits-2025-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one filed in Georgia</a> and <a href="https://www.kgns.tv/2025/08/22/13-year-old-girl-targeted-by-predator-roblox-lawsuit-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another in St. Louis</a>--alleged that two kids (one eight and the other 13) were targeted by predators. Nearly 40% of Roblox's users are under the age of 13, and although Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik said the recent negative press towards the game is based on events from "<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">five years ago</a>," these lawsuits were filed this year.</p><p>This is what prompted Uthmeier to investigate Roblox Corporation. He explained in <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/2025-0909_roblox.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the full subpoena</a> that, through the multiple investigations revealing that predators are grooming minors with the in-game currency Robux, the company must face justice.</p><p>"At the end of the day, we will stop at nothing to fight to protect our kids," he said. "And companies that act carelessly and expose them to harm will be held accountable."</p><p>Roblox Corporation now must respond to the subpoena and appear before Tampa, Florida's assistant statewide prosecutor Rita Pavan Peters on December 20.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Frogwares has revealed that its upcoming horror game&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will be delayed into next year, and it's all down to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Frogwares says that although it technically hasn't announced a release window for the survival horror sequel, it acknowledges that both its fans and Frogwares itself "were expecting a 2025 launch".</p>

<p>However, thanks to "frequent drone and missile attacks, incoming power outages, and the need to adapt to unstable conditions" owing to Russian attacks on Ukraine, Frogwares says it needs additional development time to "finish the game properly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sinking-city-2-delayed-tentacles.jpg?itok=MZTJjs4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sinking-city-2-delayed-tentacles.jpg?itok=AUtXFaPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>won't be launching in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the rather grim reason for the delay, Frogwares says that additional time will also allow it to "polish [its] first-ever survival horror experience";&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>won't be an investigative adventure game like the studio's usual fare, but a classic survival horror title instead.</p>

<p>Frogwares promises that the extra time will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>"tense, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling in all the right ways", promising to honor the survival horror genre's focus on "tension, pacing, combat, and atmosphere".</p>

<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in March 2024 during that month's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partner-preview-recap-check-out-all-news-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">Xbox Partner Preview</a> showcase. Like the first game, it promises to deliver "a distinct atmosphere of cosmic horror and twisted designs" inspired by the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.</p>

<p>Unlike the first title, however,&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will focus on survival horror mechanics; Frogwares promises "inventory management, optional puzzles, and backtracking to newly unlocked areas and hidden treasures", just like the genre's stalwarts.</p>




<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825860/The_Sinking_City_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009208" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year.

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/over-26-of-european-game-professionals-were-laid-off-in-the-past-year-more-than-10-still-searching-for-jobs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the latest Big Games Industry Employment Survey reports that over 26% of workers in game development in Europe have been laid off over the last year or so, and 10.4% of that number are still searching for a new job.</p>

<p>According to the survey, the most commonly-affected areas for layoffs are design, art, and QA testing, and those on the creative side of the industry "also felt the least secure in their roles". Perhaps unsurprisingly, management, HR, and analytics felt a much stronger sense of job security.</p>

Sony Santa Monica shown only for illustrative purposes.</figcaption></figure><p>Salaries for many jobs across Europe have fallen as well, including programming, project management, and recruitment. Naturally, that also means salary satisfaction is lower than it was last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the survey also found that the gender pay gap is very much alive and well in the gaming industry, with huge gaps between men and women in areas like the C-suite executive level and project management.</p>

<p>That disparity extends to diversity and inclusion initiatives as well; the report found that the majority of studios polled don't have dedicated DEI specialists, and that number has risen since last year as well.</p>

<p>Generally, this year's Big Games Industry Employment Survey does not paint a particularly positive picture of the industry, but given the sheer amount of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shutdowns</a> over the last few years, that's hardly surprising.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has proven a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">very successful project</a> for Funcom, but the studio decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">lay employees off earlier this month</a> anyway. Similarly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> at Xbox don't seem to be down to any performance lull on the studio's part, as its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue grew this fiscal year</a>.</p>

            <p>Frogwares have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-reveal-wet-survival-horror-sequel-the-sinking-city-2-taking-the-dev-in-a-newer-direction-in-2025">delayed the release</a> of Lovecraftian survival horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> to the first half of 2026, citing the effects of developing a game in amid the war between Russia and Ukraine as having understandably affected how long it's taken to get things done. There's no concrete new date as of right now, but the studio have shared some work-in-progress screens.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares publishing head Sergiy Oganesyan said of <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/">the delay</a>. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn.</p>
<p>"You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning. These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time."</p>
<p>"We don’t have an exact date set for 2026 yet, but we thought it was better to at least share what we do know," he added. "We’d rather be certain than announce something now only to move it again. Rest assured, we’re currently aiming for the first half of 2026, so it’s a matter of months, not years."</p><p>Alongside the 13 fresh screenshots the team have shared as part of the delay announcement, some of which I've included below, Frogwares' senior social media manager Anna Bieniek said that the studio are planning to show off "a lot more gameplay over the next few months to let everyone see how development is going".</p>



<p>The devs add that the extra time will give them leeway to ensure they've stuck the landing as well as they'd link in their switch from detective-style action to full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">survival horror</a>, which has been "a whole new kind of challenge".</p>
<p>Our Alice B had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-review-pc">mixed thoughts</a> on the original Sinking City, summing them up thusly:</p>
<blockquote>Without the weird Lovecraftian bits, this is a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town. Taking them into account, I don’t know! I was confused and uncharmed by the whole thing, but I still haven’t untangled my brainnoodles. At least I’ve told you how they got tangled. Goodness, I was very interested in The Sinking City. I really wanted to love it. But I’m afraid rain may have stopped play this time.</blockquote>
<p>Solidarity to Frogwares' devs as they carry on working get their game over the line in very tough circumstances.</p>

            <p>
Mere moments before release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been delayed by the occult implosion of developers The Chinese Room, seemingly triggered by a last-ditch request from Paradox Interactive to add a microtransaction system and start charging for every bitten neck. 
</p>
<p>
There is nothing left of The Chinese Room now. Nothing but a huge bubble of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMy885mRf-s">Cromwell invocations</a> and bisexual lighting, right in the middle of Portsmouth. Occasionally, a level designer erupts from the congealing iridescent surface, begging to be allowed to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> 2 instead, only to be dragged back into the orb by a thousand, vermillion-painted fingers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Prior to becoming a gore singularity, Bloodlines 2's developers had been poised to celebrate the fateful release of a game synonymous with development hell. Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">announced in 2019</a>. Back then, it was in development at Hardsuit Labs, with original Bloodlines creator Brian Mitsoda as narrative lead and former RPS columnist Cara Ellison as senior writer. It all seemed rather brilliant. It even earned itself the coveted double <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2s-vampires-are-goofy-dancers-preview">Caldbell</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-love-you-scary-lady-of-the-latest-bloodlines-2-demo">Thumbs-Up</a> from Alice Bee and Brendy (RPS in peace). 
</p>
<p>
Much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-bloodlines-2-explains-thinbloods-and-their-powers">ink</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/malkavians-confirmed-for-bloodlines-2-we-talked-to-brian-mitsoda-on-the-new-clan-reveal">was</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2s-dialogue-system-looks-more-subtle-than-the-original">spilled</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-us-do-a-stealthy-bitey-run-in-this-deep-demo-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Some videos</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-e3-gameplay-video">were made</a>. But then everything went sideways. In August 2020, Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-into-2021">announced a delay</a>. Then, they suddenly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">got rid of Mitsoda</a>. Then, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">tore the project from the hands of Hardsuit Labs</a>, who subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-hit-with-layoffs">laid off staff</a>. All this in the name of "doing the game justice". Mitsoda had a different take, as you'd expect. "I was not part of the conversations that led to the decision to delay production, and to my knowledge, there were no delays caused by the Bloodlines 2 narrative development," he wrote at the time of his departure from the project. "I am confident and proud of the work that I and my team put forward." 
</p><p>
Paradox apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-considered-cancelling-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">considered cancelling the game</a>, but eventually handed it over to a secret third party <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">later revealed to be The Chinese Room</a>. Then came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-is-refunding-all-pre-orders-for-bloodlines-2">preorder refunds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">more delays</a>, an interview with us in which Paradox suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">Bloodlines 2 isn't really a Bloodlines game at all</a>, a wholly unforced bit of rake-stepping in which Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">decided</a> and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-controversial-dlc-clans-will-be-in-the-base-game-after-all">undecided</a> to paywall two vampire factions, some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-hours-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-uncloak-a-slick-action-game-but-a-limited-rpg">promising Dishonored comparisons</a>, and finally, our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a>, in which Dominic Tarason deemed the game "an entertaining but flawed vampire brawler wrapped in a compelling mystery story". Whatever you may think of Paradox's treatment of Hardsuit, The Chinese Room appear to have fashioned a decent action bonanza from what they were given, despite being mostly known for games about walking and talking.
</p>
<p>
I was intrigued to play it, but alas, no more. Every server harbouring a copy of Bloodlines 2 has exploded into bony dust. Every screen carrying its image has peeled away from the monitor, folded itself into a pair of batwings and flown out the nearest window. In vain do I direct you towards <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/">Steam</a>, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_bloodlines_2">GOG</a> - clicking those store links will simply cause the earth to open and swallow you up. Bloodlines 2 was clearly a project too strange and beautiful for this world.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-cut-this-dedicated-vlogging-camera-from-dji-down-by-nearly-300-2000637436</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-osmo-pocket-3-camera-hits-its-record-low-after-multiple-price-drops-vlog-like-a-pro-but-pay-like-an-amateur.1330588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it comes to vlogging, the right tools can both elevate your content and make your workflow easier. The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 does both. Keep your phone in your pocket and use this dedicated vlogging camera to capture your footage. The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 vlogging camera is designed with YouTubers, TikTokers, and InstagramReelers in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/">Plus, right now, Amazon has the camera discounted by 27%. It’s normally listed at $799, but for a limited time, that price has been cut down to just $585. That will save you whole $214.</a></p>
<p>So why reach for the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 over your phone? Your phone is a camera after all. Heck, it’s a pretty good one. The iPhone 16 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 both have remarkable photography and videography capability, but there’s something they don’t have — unlimited storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That’s not to say the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 has unlimited storage, but it does use MicroSD. You can stock up on as many as you need with as large capacities as you need. And more importantly, keep them separate from your day-to-day stuff you are recording on your phone. That’s important for digital horders like me who constantly find themselves needing to delete old videos just to take a selfie.</p>
<h2>Impressive Videography</h2>
<p>While SD cards aren’t the main selling point here, the specs are. This camera shoots stunning footage in 4K resolution at up to 120 fps. That means you can slow your recordings down in the editing bay to slow-mo.</p>
<p>Keep your audience captivated with dynamic footage that follow your subject. The les is on a swivel which can auto-focus to your main point or person of interest and then track them as the move.

<p>Season 1 of Battlefield 6 is the start of regular free post-launch updates for the latest game in the Battlefield franchise. The season will be split into three parts: Rogue Ops, California Resistance, and Winter Offensive. </p>



<p>Rogue Ops, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 28</a>, includes the Blackwell Fields map as well as the new Strikepoint game mode, Traverser Mark 2 vehicle, three new weapons, and more. </p>



<p>After Rogue Ops comes California Resistance on November 18. Part two of the season also brings a new map in Eastwood, along with the Sabotage mode. Lastly, Winter Offensive won’t give players a new permanent map, but it will introduce the Ice Lock Empire State limited-time event map. </p>



<p>There’s also the planned release of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode. While rumors continue to suggest that the mode will launch alongside the start of Season 1, EA has yet to confirm that to be the case.</p>

<section><p>Silent Hill has always been about overcoming psychological terrors in the face of real world anxieties, and there’s no reason it should be beholden to a singular setting or formula.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Over the course of its 26-year history, the Silent Hill series has built up a reputation for offering deep dives into the more psychological side of the survival horror genre and giving players complex stories and experiences that often resonate more deeply than those found in the genre’s action-focused contemporaries. This complexity, however, doesn't mean the series is without formula. By and large, this formula generally consists of taking a tortured or doubting protagonist, placing them in the titular town covered with fog, and allowing the monsters of their mind (or cults) to envelop them to help them discover or face their transgressions. It’s a setup that’s worked time and time again for Konami, and it’s what gamers have come to expect from the beloved series.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, I find that Silent Hill works best when it takes more risks with that established formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Take, for example, the premise of the fourth entry, Silent Hill 4: The Room. The game saw players take on the role of Henry Townshend, another "tortured or doubting protagonist" forced to confront their own internal distress. But while this part of the equation remained the same, gone was the titular town. Gone was the cult that played a large presence in the first and third entries. Gone was the series' trademark fog.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Townshend spends the game trapped in a nightmarish version of his apartment--one that players are forced to thoroughly explore before being sent to a hellish landscape and undergoing a perspective shift. What The Room offered was a different take on the psychological horror story that, while similar to Silent Hill 2, brought with it new gameplay ideas that involved shifting perspectives and escort missions. It was taking expectations for a Silent Hill game and throwing them out the window in pursuit of new ideas that could move the series forward and redefine what a Silent Hill experience is.</p><p dir="ltr">Then all went quiet for a few years, and we got more traditional (and far less interesting) entries such as Silent Hill: Origins, Silent Hill: Homecoming, and Silent Hill Downpour. The series hadn’t fully stagnated just yet, but none of these entries felt like they were moving the series forward in any meaningful way. Instead, they felt like they were trying to mimic the aesthetics and story delivery of the original three games. They had the town of Silent Hill, tortured male protagonists and perspectives, and copious amounts of fog.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588693" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588693"></a><figcaption>A disturbing figure waits at the end of a hallway in this grainy still from P.T.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then in 2014, P.T. came along, and was seemingly the creative shot in the arm that Silent Hill needed. Directed by Hideo Kojima, P.T. had players traverse and down the same hallway over and over uncovering a story about family murder, discovering a bloody fetus in the bathroom sink, and encountering a ghastly creature named Lisa. Not long after its release, however, P.T. was revealed to be a small look at a cancelled game titled Silent Hills. Yet despite the teaser being both cryptic and cancelled, it arguably pushed Silent Hill into new, uncomfortable territory for the franchise, and provided players with a small taste of something that could never be.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, the series was dormant, without a mainline entry for over a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2024, however, Konami resurrected Silent Hill, delivering a full remake of Silent Hill 2 that expanded on some elements from the original. But while this remake was well-made and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">critically-acclaimed</a>, it ultimately was treading territory that the series had seen before. It became clear that if we wanted something truly <em>new </em>from Silent Hill, we'd be waiting a bit longer. Fortunately, it didn't take long for Konami to deliver.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Silent Hill f spoilers to follow--read at your own discretion.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Enter Silent Hill f, which launched just this past month. The newest entry in the series, SHF takes Silent Hill out of the titular town and sets it instead in 1960s Japan. Its setting alone is a far cry from the Twin Peaks-esque view of middle America that the series is usually known for, trading hotels, diners, and record stores for schools, shrines, and awe-inspiring temples. The newest entry also adopts a “Silent Hill is a state of mind” approach, engulfing its small Japanese town setting in the trademark fog giving it the tension-filled sense of directionlessness. It feels familiar but strange all at once.</p><p dir="ltr">That feeling carries over to the narrative as well. Being set in 1960s Japan the game tackles topics of misogyny and the expectations for women at the time to be obedient housewives who must give up large parts of their identity in the pursuit of serving their husbands. Hinako is expected to marry a partner that’s preselected for her, taking away her free will and bodily autonomy. Whereas previous Silent Hill protagonists are psychologically tortured because of actions and choices they’ve made, Hinako is thrust into a situation she had no say in that drives her to near madness.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Silent Hill series has featured a female protagonist before, its feminist themes have never been quite this prominent. SHF and its various endings show the outcomes of not merely Hinako's "bad" choices, but all of the bad choices made for her. From being driven to murderous madness, drug addiction and acceptance, and even an ending in which she reclaims her free will to pursue a relationship naturally, Silent Hill f demonstrates how the series doesn't need to hone in on guilt, shame, and sin to pack a punch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588694"></a><figcaption>Hinako kneels on bloodied ground in Silent Hill f.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to new themes, the game also dives into the more ethereal elements of the series by having segments set in the spirit world. While this is not a first for the series, Silent Hill f gives it a unique spin by spotlighting Japanese folklore, shrines, and temples, giving the entire experience a more eastern religious feeling. This is a far cry from the way religion has been depicted in past entries, which have traditionally leaned into cults and other satanic-inspired entities.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill is a horror game series where the possibilities are endless. And while Konami has a tried-and-true formula established that has carried the series throughout most of its life, Silent Hill truly shines when it takes risks with the established formula. Silent Hill has always been about overcoming psychological terrors in the face of real world anxieties and life expectations. There’s no reason it should always be beholden to a singular setting or formula.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We are so stoked to reveal that Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will grace the cover of the December issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine! <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">Subscribe today</a> to receive this issue when it launches digitally on November 4, with physical issues hitting mailboxes in the weeks following. Like all subscribers, you'll also receive complete access to all our digital archive of past <em>Game Informer</em> issues to explore at your leisure.&nbsp;</p><p>Today is a very special day for <em>Game Informer</em>, too, because this is the first time ever (<strong>somehow</strong>) that we've had a Dragon Quest game on the cover in our more than 30 years of history. This issue highlights both Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and, in a feature accompanying the cover story, the history of the Dragon Quest franchise, going all the way back to 1986.</p><p>This issue's cover image showcases the new and, dare we say, reimagined look of Dragon Quest VII in this new remake from Square Enix. Square Enix worked with a local premium doll maker to create real-life dolls of the protagonist Hero and their accompanying party, and then scanned them into the game. This approach, alongside the team's work to recreate Estard and the surrounding locales to resemble handcrafted dioramas, gives the entire package a cozy and unique look. That's reflected in the cover image below, which features Prince Kiefer, Hero, and Maribel trying to avoid the gaze of a dangerous golem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the story itself, video editor Alex Van Aken and I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to visit Square Enix's new Shibuya office, play the game for a few hours, and interview the team behind it. We also interviewed a key figure of this long-running franchise for more than 90 minutes, but you'll have to wait a bit longer to hear more about that! We have plenty more to say when the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue launches digitally next month, as we'll be posting exclusive articles and videos all month long, but it's safe to say we had a great time and are looking forward to sharing more about this remake.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It seems as though everyone is fighting to create the most popular extraction game right now, with games like Arc Raiders, Marathon, Escape from Tarkov and more battling each other for the crown. However, another challenger has waddled in from out of nowhere: Escape from Duckov.</p>
<p>Escape from Duckov is a PvE extraction game where you must roam around a map, grab as much loot as you can, then extract from the area without getting killed and losing all your ill-gotten goods. The twist? You're a duck. In fact, it's all ducks. It's ducks with guns and knives murking each other.</p>
<p>Created by Team Soda, a Bilibili game studio, the game launched to Steam on the 16th October. Since then, it has quickly risen in players, shooting up to a peak of roughly 61,000 after one day, before continuing the climb up to its current peak (as of writing) of 221,963.</p>

<p>For those unaware, the name Escape from Duckov is a play on Escape from Tarkov, arguably the first major extraction shooter in its popular form. That game is due to get its own Steam release in November, so perhaps Duckov will give eager fans something to pond-er over in the meantime. Sorry.
</p><p>Currently on sale for £15.83 / $15.83 / €15.83, the game has landed at the number three spot across global top sellers on Steam, behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>. Not bad for a game that just swam onto the platform a few days ago.</p>
<p>Escape from Duckov is spreading its wings just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-already-has-servers-slammed-by-almost-100000-players-in-two-hours-as-weekend-playtest-starts">Arc Raiders concluded its own server slam play test</a>, and right before Marathon is due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">have its next closed technical test following a shaky first impression</a>. Strictly speaking Escape from Duckov as a PvE game isn't strictly a competitor to these releases despite its cheeky name, but who knows? Maybe Escape from Duckov will continue to do well in these harsh digital waters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Game performance on the ROG Xbox Ally X is seemingly held back by its stock operating system, as installing Bazzite OS can lead to significant performance improvements in select games, according to a recent test.</p>



<p>The test was conducted by YouTuber <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CyberDopamine">Cyber Dopamine</a>, who installed <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite OS</a>, which started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS on Steam Deck before becoming a great alternative OS for the system, on the newly released gaming handheld, and tested performance in two games - <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-rog-xbox-ally-x-bazzite-os-performance-tests">ROG Xbox Ally X Bazzite OS Performance Tests</h2>



<p>In both the second entry in the series developed by Warhorse Studios and the open-world game set in the Wizarding World developed by Avalanche Software, Bazzite OS brought significant improvements over the stock Windows OS, delivering the best results in Performance Mode (17W). In Silent Mode (13W), however, the performance difference was minimal.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Game</th><th>Power Mode </th><th>Windows Average FPS</th><th>Bazzite OS Average FPS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</td><td>Performance (17W)</td><td>47</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</td><td>Silent (13W)</td><td>35</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Turbo (35W)</td><td>60</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Performance (17W)</td><td>50</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Silent (13W)</td><td>38</td><td>37</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Even when the performance difference is minimal, the ROG Xbox Ally X running Bazzite OS still seems to come out on top. The performance in both games proved to be more stable, with none of the performance spikes seen under Windows. In addition, Bazzite OS brings some quality-of-life improvements over Windows in terms of usability, with a much better and faster sleep mode that makes the handheld much more practical to use.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though its stock OS brings some issues, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful and capable PC handheld, and one of the best on the market.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind</a> has lots of houses. Some of those houses house houses. House Indoril is one of those housed houses, more specifically the one to which Indoril Nevevar, the bloke Morrowind's protagonist is a reincarnation of, belonged. After about two decades of waiting, the modders behind massive project Tamriel Rebuilt are set to start dishing out Indoril membership cards with their next expansion.</p>
<p>Damn, shout the three great houses you can join in base Morrowind, the salespeople of Hlaalu, the grizzled warriors of Redoran, and the spoiled shroom-dwelling sorcerers of Telvanni. There goes our very long window to convince Vvardenfell's most capable magic gauntlet deliverer to join up with us and improve our Sotha street creed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This next expansion to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morrowinds-tamriel-rebuilt-mod-now-has-as-many-quests-as-the-base-game-and-expansions">ever-growing modding project</a> is set to add in a heartlands section of an all new Orethan region which surrounds the city of Almalexia (AKA Mournhold) on the mainland section of the province, as outlined by the devs in a teaser <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/poison-song-teaser">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"Adding the slice of Orethan Heartlands to the release unlocked one of the holy grails that TR players had been waiting for more than twenty years – the ability to join House Indoril," wrote the wonderfully-named Sultan of Rum. "Much effort had already been spent in the mid-2010s to create a unique character for House Indoril, resulting in the wonderful interactions seen in Roa Dyr in 2019’s Aanthirin expansion. A couple of years ago, however, we consolidated and largely transformed this characterization into a comprehensive design document, including a plan for a full Indoril questline."</p><p>"The addition of the Gorne and Nanaav chapels to the already extant Roa Dyr gives us three major Indoril power centers, which is enough for the first part of their overarching questline," they continued. "All three chapels will have separate relatively low-level questlines introducing you to local issues and the personalities of the ruling Indorils. Indoril Sandil of Gorne – the most forward-thinking and adaptable of the three – may agree to become your patron for real advancement in the venerable House, should you humor his fascination with the legacy of Nerevar in a series of higher-level quests."</p>
<p>As for what you can expect of the faction more generally, the modder specifies that the short answer is a battle to turn around the fortunes of Morrowind's former most powerful party, who've been left shellshocked by a deal that pesky Vivec's struck with the Empire's Tiber Septim. "Seeing the surrender of Morrowind to an outlander warlord as a cataclysm, the surviving Indoril lords have been gripped in doubt and misfunction ever since – mirroring what is happening to their patron, the goddess Almalexia," Sultan of Rum explained. "In their nihilism, they have proven unable to unite in the face of serious challenges to their hegemony, much less effectively counteract the increasingly brazen encroachment by houses Hlaalu and Telvanni."</p>
<p>And here I thought Poison Song, whose creators say they're aiming to be in the process of finalising it in "a matter of months", was gonna be all about belting out that one Alice Cooper tune with your Indoril mates. It's almost as if I should have known that theory was doomed the moment the modders reminded me in their post that Poison Song is the name of a history book in the original Morrowind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing power can be frustrating, whether you’re chilling at home or exploring out there in the wild. If you’re looking for a backup solution that can juice all your essentials up and is easier to carry around with you on the go, Anker makes some solid options. Even better, you can grab one of its best power stations for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Anker Solix C1000 portable power station by 50%, bringing it down to just $398.</a> That’s a serious discount on a solution that takes care of all your energy needs, but the offer ends soon. Grab it for less while there’s still some time left.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11 Ports to Charge All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>For under $400, Solix C1000 offers 1800W of power with a 2400W peak output. Without sugarcoating anything, this is enough power to juice up pretty much all your essentials. The 11 built-in ports are a mix of AC outlets, USB-A, USB-C, and a car socket, meaning whether you’re looking to charge your smartphone or a kitchen appliance like a coffee maker, it can power it all. According to Anker’s own testing, the Solix C1000 can run a projector for up to 23.4 hours, a portable coffee maker for 2.7 hours, an electric grill for 1 hour, and even a kettle for just under an hour. You can manage everything using the Anker app on your phone. That includes checking the power status, getting low power alerts, and even customizing charging speeds using it.</p>



<p>Recharging the power station itself is fast, too. If you plug it into a wall outlet and enable UltraFast recharging via the Anker app, it can go from 0 to 80% in just 43 minutes. Prefer using solar panels to recharge? The Solix C1000 should be up and running in just 1.8 hours. Battery longevity is impressive, thanks to its LiFePO4 battery, which is rated for over 3,000 charging cycles. That translates to around 10 years of use without worrying about degradation.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the power station is surprisingly small. In fact, it is about 15% smaller than other 1kWh-class power stations. Carrying it around on your trip won’t be an issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/">This deal brings the price down to less than $400, after a whopping 50% discount.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this power station drop to in a long while, which is why we recommend acting fast to grab it before the deal expires.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>It just got more expensive to keep up with Warner Bros. new DC universe. Just a couple of weeks after <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2 wrapped up, HBO has quietly announced another set of price hikes. The move comes shortly after CEO David Zaslav <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">foreshadowed</a> putting a fresh squeeze on existing customers.</p><p>The hikes range from $1 to $2 a month, and from $10 to $20 annually. Here are the new prices, effective October 21:</p><div> <ul> <li>HBO Max Basic with ads: $11 monthly ($1 increase) / $110 yearly ($10 increase)</li> <li>HBO Max Standard: $18.50 monthly ($1.50 increase) / $185 yearly ($15 increase)</li> <li>HBO Max Premium: $23 monthly ($2 increase) / $230 yearly ($20 increase)</li> </ul> <p>This latest batch of increases, which users have 30 days to decline before getting auto-renewed at the higher rate, comes just a year after the last round, which saw the standard ad-free plan and 4K ad-free plans both go up by $1 a month each. At this rate, HBO with ads will be more than HBO for cable used to be before the end of the decade.</p> <p>“I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively,” Zaslav <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">told Wall Street</a> last month.</p> <p>The latest subscriber crunch, which includes a crackdown on password sharing, comes months ahead of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>‘ debut in January 2026, followed by a raft of other new shows and movies. In other news, Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html">announced on Tuesday</a> that it’s happy to sell if anyone is looking to buy.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-price-game-thrones-last-us-superman-2000637662]]></content:encoded>

It’s a constant balancing act of keeping your employees satisfied, making your park profitable, and meeting your guests’ needs, whether that means having enough bathrooms or just not getting eaten by a velociraptor. Jurassic World Evolution 3 once again puts you in the role of park manager, giving you a chance to do what the John Hammonds and Simon Masranis of the world could not: run a thriving, lucrative theme park with attention-grabbing dinosaur attractions and minimal violent deaths. With a complex set of management and customization tools, Evolution 3 gives you more control over your park than ever before. The result is an incredibly engaging management sim that’s a high point in an already satisfying series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the first two, Jurassic World Evolution 3 shares a lot of DNA with other theme park sims. You’re responsible for laying down paths and electrical infrastructure, building amenities that appeal to your clientele, and creating experiences that get more guests through your gates. Rather than roller coasters and haunted houses, though, the attractions are all about the dinosaurs. Just about any species will garner business, but having a variety is the key to long-term success — and thankfully, you’ll have a wealth of different dino types to choose from. There’s always a bit of a thrill in seeing these legendary creatures come to life, especially when you unlock the more recognizable species from the films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, when you go to Disneyland, there’s almost no chance that Mickey and the princesses will escape their enclosures and maul the park-goers. That adds an extra layer of danger to Evolution 3, and park managers will have to maintain a high safety rating to continue to pull in money. Think of it as a chill, cozy management sim punctuated by moments of panic and terror. You’ll have to keep your dinosaurs happy by meeting their food, environmental, and cohabitation needs. Some need room to roam or prefer to live in packs, while others can thrive in small areas with only a bit of pasture to nibble on. Carnivores require either fresh meat or live prey, while herbivores need greenery, fruit, and nuts. Flying and swimming dinosaurs need special enclosures, since fencing in a pteranodon is about as useful as hiding from a T-Rex in a bathroom stall. It’s really satisfying to get into a loop of researching dig sites, sending expeditions to those sites, extracting DNA, and finally, finding the perfect spot to incubate your newly discovered species. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that seems like a lot to manage, it is — but the campaign does a great job of walking you through the increasingly complex mechanics. Head of PR Cabot Finch, who you might remember from the previous Jurassic World Evolution games, returns as your guide as you visit existing parks in progress around the world and restore them to greatness. In a nod to the original Jurassic Park, the campaign begins in the Montana badlands and eventually takes you to Las Vegas, Hawaii, and throughout Europe and Asia, adding a lot of variety to the local scenery. Finch is accompanied by a team of scientists and dinosaur experts, but the real star is Jeff Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm pops up from time to time to remind everyone that trying to control nature inevitably leads to disaster.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Think of it as a cozy management sim punctuated by moments of terror. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’re already familiar with the series, the campaign mode is an effective way of familiarizing yourself with Evolution 3’s new features. The biggest addition is the introduction of in-park breeding. Previously, you could only synthesize dinosaurs based on how much of their DNA you extracted from fossils found on expeditions. Now, once you’ve synthesized compatible males and females of the same species, you can set up a cozy nesting area and wait for them to get busy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This mechanic adds a few interesting new wrinkles to the tried-and-true Jurassic World Evolution formula. You can work with your scientists to create a breeding plan, or preferably just wait and see if nature takes its course. Who knew it would be so fun to play matchmaker to a bunch of prehistoric creatures? Once the next generation hatches, juveniles might have different needs than their parents.  For example, while grown carnivores prefer to hunt their own prey, baby raptors and T-rexes will need stores of prepared meat in their pens. The tallest dinosaurs can reach the foliage on treetops, but their offspring will need nourishment closer to the ground. If you let breeding go on unchecked, pens can get overcrowded, which leads to breakouts and general panic among your guests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re managing these dinosaur family units, you’ll also have to curry favor with the entertainment, security, and conservation factions, another new feature. You can gain reputation by completing certain contracts, which are basically well-paid side missions, and improving the quality of your parks. Gaining a positive reputation with all three factions becomes very important in the last few chapters of the story, but they don’t necessarily want the same things. Pleasing them becomes yet another balancing act that adds more depth to the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign in Jurassic World Evolution 2 felt more like an extended tutorial, but this time around, you have more breathing room to find your own management style. Its objectives serve as a backbone to the overall story in which an activist group called Extinction Now! regularly hacks into your communications and sabotages your parks. As you make your way around the globe, you’ll also need to put a stop to Extinction Now!’s histrionics. The first few parks are heavily guided, but once the map opens up and you go international, you have a lot of welcome freedom to meet your objectives in whatever way you see fit. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pleasing the new factions is yet another balancing act that adds depth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the fun of the management sim genre is being able to create something entirely from scratch, which you can do in sandbox mode. This mode has been a staple of the Jurassic World Evolution games, and Evolution 3 offers even more customization options. To start, you can choose any of the locations from the campaign, generate an island with its own unique topography, or use the square maps for a perfectly flat, obstacle-free mass of land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have control over almost every aspect in the sandbox, including your starting funds, certain dinosaur behaviors, and beyond. You can make it more challenging for yourself with a shoestring budget or choose unlimited funding to remove all cost barriers to creating the dinosaur theme park of your dreams depending on what you are in the mood for. You can take on contracts to make extra money, but for the most part, sandbox mode is an unguided experience. It’s easy to lose track of time when you’re making sure your paths are perfectly aligned or setting up an unforgettable park tour with maximum dinosaur visibility. And unlike in the campaign, where Cabot, Malcolm, and the rest of the cast are frequently chattering at you, the sandbox is quiet and zen. Well, at least until the indoraptors get loose.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The third gameplay mode, scenarios, was my least favorite of the three. These timed challenges, which can take anywhere from 12 minutes to a couple of hours, have specific objectives and restrictions. In one, you’ll have to take manual control of one of your ranger teams and take photos of wild dinosaurs; in another, you might be barred from editing the existing dinosaur pens regardless of the well-being of those inside. I couldn’t get on board with this time-trial approach to park management; for me, it was antithetical to the zen-like experience I’m looking for in a sim, and the objectives weren’t interesting enough to make them worth the effort. I found myself missing Jurassic World Evolution 2’s Chaos Theory mode, which sadly appears to be extinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even though I didn’t personally vibe with the Scenarios, it’s impressive that Evolution 3 offers options for just about every kind of management sim fan. If you need a story to guide you through the gameplay, the campaign has you covered. If you want to build something that’s entirely your own, you can do so in the sandbox. And if you actually like high-pressure time trials, you’ll probably find Scenario mode more satisfying than I did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m even more impressed with the quality-of-life updates Evolution 3 brings to the series. With the right infrastructure, you can automate maintenance and medical care, saving you from having to manually track down those units every time there’s a crisis. Aspects that were convoluted or confusing in the previous games, like creating park tours, are far more straightforward. There are more tours to choose from beyond the standard Jeep rides and gyroscopes from the movies; you can set up a hot air balloon tour or build a Cretaceous Cruise that allows guests to canoe through rivers and lakes. Boosting your transportation score by setting up monorail stations and tracks throughout the park feels much more intuitive this time around. As you expand, you can easily edit the existing tracks to expand their reach — or just set up an underground hyperloop to make traversing the park even simpler. A lot of rough edges have been smoothed out.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Management sim zen</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I ran into a few technical issues while playing, though most of them have already been addressed by a patch. Most notably, the “continue” and “load” options were missing from the menu every time I started it up, so I had to begin a new game and load manually from there every time I wanted to get back into my ongoing campaign. This meant more long load screens and hearing the opening voiceover over a dozen times, which isn’t ideal. Again, that thankfully appears to have been fixed, but I also experienced a few crashes when trying to revisit my Indonesia park, which meant going through that same loop of starting a new game and loading all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another drawback of playing Evolution 3 before release is that I didn’t get to check out the community creations. Because it has so many more customization options than its predecessors, it makes sense that players would want to share their creations with the world. It’s a fun idea on paper, though I can’t say for certain whether it works in execution since there was an extremely limited player pool before launch.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">In the first Jurassic Park movie, there’s a moment when the main characters see dinosaurs in the wild for the first time and they’re almost frozen in amazement. The Jurassic World Evolution series has done an incredible job of recreating that feeling since its first installment. Seeing your first dinos leave their incubation center is always a thrill, and it gets even more exciting when your park becomes populated by pteranodons, megalodons, fierce carnivores, looming long-necked herbivores, and hybrid species that defy man and nature. Jurassic World Evolution 3 builds on an already impressive foundation to give aspiring dinosaur theme park managers more control than ever before. New features and quality-of-life updates make the third installment the pinnacle of the series, even if the Scenario mode doesn’t hold a candle to the previous game’s Chaos Theory. If building and maintaining a dinosaur theme park is your idea of a good time, Evolution 3 has plenty to offer.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has further detailed its plan to break apart or be sold. In a news release today, the media giant that owns the developers of Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter games said it has received "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties already to acquire the entirety of the company or just Warner Bros.</p><p>These parties were not named outright, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg recently reported</a> that Paramount submitted a $20/share bid for WBD, which the company rejected. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported</a> that Netflix and Comcast might be in the mix, too. Netflix already is invested in the gaming space and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">continues to ramp up its efforts</a> after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">some previous setbacks. </a></p><p>WBD said its board will "evaluate a broad range of strategic options" moving forward as it relates to the company's previously announced plan to sell the entire company or break it up in multiple sales or spin-offs.</p><p>CEO David Zaslav said he's trying to find a buyer or multiple buyers to help "unlock the full value of our assets." WBD board of directors chair Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr. added, "We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value," but that it's important as well to "broaden" the scope of potential transactions to find a deal that pays the company the most possible money for its assets.</p><p>WBD did not set a deadline or a timetable for when it will complete this newest strategic review for these "strategic alternatives" to the previously announced separation plan. That plan, meanwhile, is booked to be completed by mid-2026, if it happens at all.</p><p>Also today, WBD announced <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-max-prices-increases-plans-2025-1236557671/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another price hike for HBO Max, and it's the third in three years.</a> WBD's stock price is soaring today, up more than 10% so far.</p><p>As for WBD's gaming efforts, the company has said it will focus on core franchises going forward with the highest potential of making money back. Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>.

The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.</p><p>One we do know about is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-691445">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which launches in 2026 from developer Traveller's Tales. As for the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is coming October 30, but it's published by Atari, not Warner Bros. A project that is not coming to market is Wonder Woman, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">WBD canceled the game and closed the studio, Monolith.</a> The company also closed Player First Games and WB San Diego earlier this year.</p><p>WBD management said the breakout success of Hogwarts Legacy gives the company the confidence that it can "get back to producing high-quality games built for long-term consumer engagement." The company said it expects its video game division to return to profitability in 2025 with the games division looking to become a "more significant contributor to growth in the years ahead."</p><p>WB's longtime gaming boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he is leaving the company but will stay on for the time being to help with the transition process.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> director Nicolas Doucet is adamant the PlayStation 5 has "really brought something special", amid criticism of this generation of hardware being an incremental improvement over the last.</p>
<p>It's been five years since Sony released the PS5, but many of its exclusives have been crossovers with - or sequels to - PS4 games. Astro Bot, however, was a showcase of the PS5's capabilities, as Doucet explained to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-ps5-generation-has-brought-something">The Game Business</a>.</p>
<p>"When you put graphics side-by-side between an end-of-lifecycle PS4 game and early cycle PS5 game, you could argue, to an untrained eye, that it's hard to see the difference," Doucet admitted.</p>

<p>"But early on [with PS5] we got the DualSense prototypes, with this haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. And we tried to understand what could be different about having this kind of trigger, so you can simulate pulling something, or cracking something, or crushing something... We tested all of that.</p><p>"When you've gone through [that process], you get to appreciate the changes," he continued. "There are some leaps, but they're maybe less obvious than when we went to HD graphics. That's something that you can just stare at the screen for a few seconds and understand. With the controller, you have to get it in your hands and get a feel for it.</p>
<p>"But I do think the PS5, between the DualSense and the SSD, really brought something special. With the SSD… I'm thinking of things like the Souls games, where you die a lot. And when you die, you used to have to wait a long time before you get a second try. With the SSD, that becomes really, really fast. So, in terms of just the pleasure of play, that's really increased."</p>
<p>What's more, Team Asobi is focused on PS5 exclusive games, despite Sony releasing its first party games on PC.</p>
<p>"We really focus on PS5," said Doucet. "We want to take full advantage of the DualSense and SSD. There is always a way to cross bridges if we ever need it. But really, the main focus is on the PlayStation console."</p>
<p>Doucet also prefers console development as it avoids incompatibility issues with varying PC setups.</p>
<p>"It's specific hardware that is absolutely set," Doucet said of the PS5. "You know that what you see in your office making the game, is definitely what people will see in their home playing the game. That allows us to focus, because you're not putting in time dealing with compatibility or permutations. It's why I've always liked consoles."</p>
<p>Further, Doucet discussed the length of Astro Bot too, and the benefits of developing a more concise, focused experience.</p>
<p>While there is a "minimum scope" for a project to be considered a full game, the team didn't want to spread itself too thin.</p>
<p>"We use the analogy of food," Doucet explained. "When you're really hungry, if I propose to go to a buffet, you can eat anything you like and that's going to sound appealing. But as you go through that meal, maybe by the end of it you've eaten too much and you almost regret it and you don't necessarily appreciate what's left, and maybe you keep a lukewarm memory of it.</p><p>"Whereas if we go to a place where it's going to be just enough, you're going to keep a good memory and maybe you want more. The way we think of it is to not overload the player so that in the end they feel fed up."</p>
<p>Doucet's comments<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-ok-to-make-a-small-game-says-astro-bot-director-on-its-aa-level-success"> echo his own from GDC earlier this year</a>, where he stated it's "OK to make a small game". "A lot of choices we made with Astro Bot could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter," he said. "We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>
<p>Which games do you think prove the success of the PS5? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>It’s Jackbox Party Pack time once again, and can you believe we’re on Jackbox 11 now? How time flies. It feels like it was only last year that the JPP was barely learning to walk. , this time around brings five brand-new games into the fray, and while they do all feel familiar, it’s one of the strongest Party Packs in recent years, thanks to some really good execution.</p>
<p><iframe title="GAMEPLAY TRAILER | The Jackbox Party Pack 11 | Available OCT 23" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8IwlJvXhgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Doominate is this time around’s writing game. It has you and your friends trying to ruin different phrases, people, or things by putting a spin on them. This can be very clever, and it was for the most part, but it is also the game most likely to end up with you and your friends sending yourselves to hell as fast as possible by exposing your sins. The execution here is a lot of fun though, and while the Death character in this is a little unfunny, the overall presentation is really good.</p>



<p>Hear Say is my standout, but it’s also the most awkward of the bunch. You and your mates need to make stupid sound effects for this one, with prompts including things like trying to make a sound like gargling mouthwash, to doing a Miss Piggy vocal warm-up. This is about as close to Dropout’s Make Some Noise as we’re going to get in video game form, and it’s a blast online. The mini-games are bad in it though, and the game would be better without them.</p>

<p>I do also think that there’s a divide between playing online and in-person. You can mute your online mics when playing online, which means you can keep all of your sound effects that you’re making a surprise, which feels preferable to everyone being in the same room and already hearing what others are doing, and potentially also ending up in the background of each other’s takes. For as boisterous as it wants you to be, there’s also that awkwardness of public performance.</p>

<p>The obligatory drawing game comes in the form of Cookie Haus, which&nbsp;has you all glazing cookies in different shapes and naming them. The commitment to icing physics adds to the entertaining feeling of the whole affair, and pandering to the weird requests of the customers is a good time all around. Trying to work around the weird shapes you end up with really helps boost your creativity as well.</p>

<p>Suspectives bring a little social deduction to the table, as between four and eight people try to fool each other and catch the criminal among you. You start off having to answer a slew of survey questions, which then provide the basis for back and forth of interrogation, evidence, debate and voting phases, as you try to narrow down the main suspects. It’s a fun time, but it definitely helps to be pretty close friends and family through this, though you could obviously fib during the initial surveys. It’s also potentially the trickiest mode to organise and play. It really benefits from having the higher player count, but game nights are difficult to organise when everyone in your friend group now has kids to argue with over whether it’s bedtime or not.</p>

<p>Finally, we’ve got Legends of Trivia, which is easily the best trivia game we’ve had in ages. This has you all working cooperatively to defeat all manner of beasts in RPG-alike combat, and eventually find the legendary Bookwyrm. The questions are varied in topic, delivery, and style, and there’s an extra strategic layer of being able to split your answers if you’re uncertain, and item management that helps make this an absolute blast to play. I normally dislike the trivia games, but Legends of Trivia sets an entirely new standard for them all.</p>

		If Jackbox Party Pack 11 is anything to go by, then the second decade of Jackbox is going to be great. There's a familiar feel to the pack as a whole, but it's really well put together and there's a great injection of noisy new ideas.	</p></div>

			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares announced that its next project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sinking City 2</a>, is being moved to the first half of 2026. The first and most tragic reason is the continued assault on Ukraine by the Russian Federation, with the developers having to deal with power loss on top of the constant worry for their own safety. Sergiy Oganesyan, Head of Publishing at Frogwares, stated:</p>



<p><em>Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to. At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time. </em></p>

<p>The development of The Sinking City 2 is also going slower because Frogwares is shifting the sequel's genre from the first installment's action/adventure to survival horror. Lead Game Designer Alexander Gresko explained:</p>



<p><em>Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation adventures for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episode 1 & 2 Impressions - A Tale to Tell]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions-a-tale-to-tell.1330498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Telltale Games created a formula for adventure games that, when done well, is a near-perfect way to absorb a narrative interactively. So many have failed to do it right since their heyday, even Telltale themselves, that releases in that episodic choice-driven style have been few and far between. From what I can tell, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/dispatch-is-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch </em>has taken all the right lessons</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dispatch </em>is set in a world of superheroes, where they are so abundant they even solve the world’s pettiest problems and crimes, like de-escalating an argument over someone cutting in line.</p>

<p>You play as Robert Robertson, a former hero who does not have superpowers, who gets a job at a dispatch center for superheroes. You’re tasked with managing a team of still-reforming supervillains to fight crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Dispatch </em>is a classic workplace comedy set in an absurd world. Weird powers lead to weird personalities, and powerful people will have powerful egos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with the style of Telltale adventure games, <em>Dispatch </em>will be readily familiar to you immediately. There are some QTEs during scenes (which you can turn off), and many dialogue choices will be met with a “so and so will remember that” in the corner of your screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest deviation, and I suppose this may change in future episodes, is that there’s no roaming around or character control. It’s all cutscenes, dialogue, and then some other added gameplay elements I’ll get into with specific episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really, large chunks of <em>Dispatch </em>are like an interactive TV show, which bears out in the playtime with each episode being about an hour (so far anyway). There’s still some interesting gameplay going on, however.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Episode 1 – Pivot&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first episode gives you all the setup for the world and the character you play, Robert Robertson. He is the third generation of Mecha Man, both his father and grandfather dying as heroes as they served the Southland area of Los Angeles. They were well-beloved, leaving quite the legacy for Robert to live up to.</p>

<p>As the episode starts with the history of the world and your character, we get to see Mecha Man in action. Hot on the tail of Shroud, the villain that killed Robert's father, we infiltrate a steel mill full of his goons.</p>

<p>Things don’t go well, and Robert survive,s but his Mecha Man suit does not. Without that, he can’t be a hero anymore, as he has no powers. And as you see his apartment in the opening minutes of the game... Robert's not exactly flush with cash for repairs.</p>

<p>The story goes on from there, but I don’t want to go into the plot too much to let you experience it yourself. Robert's motivations and personality come through from the opening seconds of the game, and the history of Mecha Man does a great job of showing just how important being Mecha Man is to him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One scene is a perfect example of why the episode works and sets up what we're in for with <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

<p>The scene takes place in a bar for superheroes, which does a great job of showing you the world of <em>Dispatch</em>. Heroes are so mundane, so numerous that this isn't some elite club -- just a bar in a normal neighborhood. The decor looks like it'd be a decent stand-in for a bar just about anywhere.</p>

<p>In the scene prior, we're introduced to Blonde Blazer, who rescues the suitless Mecha Man from some thieves who were beating the hell out of Robert until she got there. She takes him to the bar for Robert to unwind and get to know him.</p>

<p>Blonde Blazer works for Superhero Dispatch Network, and you eventually learn that she's there to learn a little about Robert to evaluate whether he'd be a good fit for the company. Considering the name of the game, he turns out to be a pretty good fit.</p>

<p>The scene is pretty short but efficient and effective. The quick interactions with Blonde Blazer and a couple of other characters in the bar and just the setting of the bar itself set up the main thrust of the story, introduce hugely important characters, give you a great sense of the world, and shows you the exact sort of tone and humor to expect from the game.</p>

<p>Of the humor, there's one specific joke I want to talk about in this episode. I think the humor mostly sort of works this episode, but some fall flat for similar reasons as this next one.</p>



<p>The thieves Blonde Blazer helped Robert with were all wearing different colored beanies, so Robert jokingly refers to them as skittles. At the bar, Blonde Blazer laughs, saying she hadn't even noticed that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert replies, “you know what they can taste the rainbow in jail.” Fine enough joke that mostly works. Decent setup, decent payoff.</p>

<p>Then Blonde Blazer says, “What do you mean? Like different colored dicks?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah, so close. This sort of wink-wink, nudge-nudge moment comes up a few times in Episode 1. They just don't end up working and feel like a prude's attempt at crude humor sometimes. Having played some more of <em>Dispatch</em>, particularly the next episode, I think it falls into a better groove where the irreverent humor lands most of the time.</p>

<p>If you’re reading a few impressions or reviews on <em>Dispatch</em>, I imagine there’s going to be a lot of <em>The Boys&nbsp;</em>comparisons. The crude humor with shocking visuals is somewhat in <em>Dispatch</em>, but at a much lower level. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very early on, you fight a guy who is naked with penis flapping in the wind throughout the fight. Because it happens so early, you'd think there would be more things like it. There's really not, though.</p>



<p>It feels like <em>Dispatch </em>wants to dip its toes in every so often, coming across like its a kid getting away with something than embracing the joke. So, the inevitable <em>The Boy</em>s comparisons don't work for me, as <em>The Boys</em> commits to its identity fully and forcefully. <em>Dispatch </em>just wants to be naughty every so often.</p>

<p>Overall, I think Episode 1 does a great job setting up the world of Dispatch and introducing some of the major characters.</p>

<h2>Episode 2 - Onboard</h2>

<p>I'm glad Episode 2 is coming out at the same time as 1, as there's still a whole lot more of the world to learn and characters to meet.</p>

<p>Here, Robert finally gets to work as a dispatcher, and you’re introduced to the team of heroes you’ll be working with. "Hero" may be overstating how to describe them, as they're a bunch of still-reforming villains. Nicknamed the Z Team, they're not the easiest to work with.</p>

<p>One is a man who looks like a bat but can turn more bat-like at times -- he's smart and a former finance criminal. One's a hothead who controls fire, another an arrogant gal who turns invisible -- the list goes on, but suffice to say they are all very vocal and have some loose morals.</p>



<p>Episode 2&nbsp; is where some more gameplay elements enter as well, as you will be dispatching your team to various calls, from fights, to kaijus, to security details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team members have unique stats, with some better at fighting, others who are smarter, etc. They can level up and you can put to improve stats as you see fit, and there are even some unique abilities they can gain too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each call for dispatch will give you some keywords and descriptions to give you a hint as to what stats may be better suited for a job. Depending on what you choose, you’ll see a graph like the above where the orange area shows what the hero or team of heroes covers on that graph, and the white area shows what you need to cover. The white part is revealed after you choose, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the time, you won’t cover it all, so you’re at the whims of a bouncing ball in the white area that you hope eventually ends in the area you have covered, or you'll fail.</p>



<p>Sending heroes to calls, them handling the call, and then returning to base from calls all take time, making you have to juggle a lot of things at once. Calls are on the board for a limited time before you automatically fail them, and you don't want to be caught out with no one to send. Or worse, having only one or two to send that are obviously not suited for the call.</p>

<p>It’s all pretty simple, so don’t expect anything too crazy.&nbsp;<em>Dispatch </em>will just throw a lot of choices and timers at you at once. It's engaging the entire time, and it’s certainly never boring.</p>

<p>While all that is going on, there are a lot of entertaining conversations on the team, whether it's a comment on the call they're sent to, who they're paired with, or just some random conversation as everything is going on. It really lets the all-star cast of incredible voice acting shine.</p>



<p>The other bit of gameplay is how Robert can more directly help the team through hacking. These are presented as little puzzles where you open up pathways to move around and collect information or codes you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hacking is simple at first, but they do add some more elements, like some of them being timed, virus protection that chases you around the pathways as you try to quickly input a code, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on how you feel about some quick, simple puzzling, I think your mileage will vary. There’s nothing there to wow you, but there are a few standout ones that directly involve members of your team that ratchet the tension nicely. Like quickly hacking some water tanks that may douse you're fire-powered hero on the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, Episode 2 is where everything started to gel completely. The cast of characters is fun, and dispatching is totally engaging, making the time fly by. Episode 2 is great at making the huge cast shine, and that's where the game's greatest strength lies.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the opening of <em>Dispatch</em>. While it may be less interactive than the Telltale games of old, <em>Dispatch </em>streamlines how you interact with its narrative and makes the gameplay elements intrinsic to the game itself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a one-two opener, it's a great opening. Episode 1 spends a lot of time with Robert, the main character, and the second episode sets up the gameplay and huge cast of characters, putting its "secret sauce" of incredible voice talent front and center.</p>

<p>This is a style of game that I think people yearning for more of that Telltale goodness from years ago will be very satisfied with. I can't wait for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-killed-adam-driver%E2%80%99s-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason.1330486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kylo Ren/Ben Solo actor Adam Driver recently revealed that after working on the sequel trilogy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797"><em>Star Wars</em> films</a>, he and acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh pitched a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie to Lucasfilm. But because the movie was set after <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-okay-lets-talk-about-star-wars-the-rise-of-skyw-1840561224">2019’s<em> Rise of Skywalker</em></a> and starred Ben Solo, who dies at the end of that film, Disney allegedly passed on the project, which was tentatively named <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/adam-driver-star-wars-soderbergh-jarmusch-4e08164d0419759f1b5b50d69864975d">In a new interview with the <em>Associated Press</em>,</a> Driver talked about his career, his love of working with talented filmmakers, and the struggle to get projects funded and approved. And during this conversation, he talked about a previously unknown<em> Star Wars</em> film that he and Soderbergh were pitching to Lucasfilm and Disney around 2021.</p>

 <p>“I always was interested in doing another <em>Star Wars</em>,” Driver told the <em>AP</em>. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. [Lucasfilm] had reached out. I always said: With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second. I loved [Kylo Ren] and loved playing him.”</p>

  <p>So Driver teamed up with director Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt to create an outline for a film that would star Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo, who in the sequel trilogy has fallen to the Dark Side and become Kylo Ren. However, by the end of <em>The Rise of Skywalker,</em> Solo has redeemed himself, turned good, and eventually sacrifices his life to save Rey’s. Apparently, according to Driver, Lucasfilm execs loved it. So the group hired Scott Z. Burns to write a full script, which Driver told the <em>AP</em> was “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.” Next, it was time to pitch the movie to Disney. And that’s when it all fell apart.</p>

 <p>“We took it to [Disney CEO] Bob Iger and [Disney co-chairman] Alan Bergman, and they said no,” said Driver. “They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that. It was called <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo,</em> and it was really cool. But it is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”</p>

 <p>The AP reached out to Soderbergh, who confirmed Driver’s story and added, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”</p> <p>According to Driver, the plan was to be “judicial” and “economical” with the proposed film’s budget, and for it to be in the “same spirit” <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311">as older <em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, which are “handmade and character driven.” But sadly, Disney didn’t want to bring back Ben Solo. Meanwhile, remember when Disney brought the fucking Emperor back to life because it gave up on the sequel trilogy’s main villains halfway through? We live in the worst timeline.</p>
