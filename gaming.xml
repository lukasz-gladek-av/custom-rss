            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-battlegrounds-director-discusses-the-importance-of-the-games-community<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PUBG: Battlegrounds celebrated its seventh anniversary this year, and it’s still going strong. The free-to-play battle royale shooter has welcomed millions of players from around the world during those seven years, and the development team has been focused on releasing new content and updates to keep that massive community engaged.</p><p>“The key thing that I’ve learned over the past seven years is how important fans are,” said Taehyun Kim, Production Director of PUBG: Battlegrounds. “Our game has been serviced globally and it has been played in many countries and by many people around the world. So we keep looking for ways to satisfy diverse countries and diverse fans.”</p><p>Kim has been a member of the PUBG team since its initial phase of development in 2016. He worked his way up to Production Director, where he is now responsible for guiding all aspects of the game’s progress. We got a chance to sit down and chat with him in Cologne, Germany, where he and his team were on hand for gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Throughout our discussion, Kim stressed how vital he thinks it is for developers to stay in contact with their player base. He’s even been going out of his comfort zone to engage with fans publicly in new ways.</p><p>“I had a livestream with Korean users, and it was really, really challenging,” Kim said. “I’m a developer, not a professional emcee, so I was afraid. ‘Oh, what if I make a mistake in front of this many people in real time?’ But I think, of course it is difficult, but I need to keep challenging myself and I have to continue this effort.”</p><p>That effort is one of the reasons he came to Cologne. He attended PUBG: Hot Drop Cologne, an in-person event that allowed fans to meet the game’s devs, partners, and other special guests. It was one of the first times Kim has had direct contact with Western players, which is something he wants to continue to improve at.</p><p>“I’m Korean, and I’m more comfortable speaking in Korean, so I have been communicating with Korean users using livestreaming,” he said. “But that was kind of my preparation to more effectively communicate with Western and English-speaking users. Currently we are looking forward and we are looking at different ways to more effectively communicate with our users around the world. So starting with this gamescom, we are going to keep continuing this effort to communicate with our fans.”</p><p>Of course, building a community relies on more than devs connecting with players. It’s also about allowing players to form connections with each other. August was Clan Month, which added weekly clan challenges and a new rewards system. It also allowed players to join the fan clans of eight popular esports teams. It all builds to a special tournament at the end of the month, when clan members get the chance to team up with professional players.</p><p>“For the clan system, what we want to offer to our players is to create an environment where they can create a new community and they can enjoy the game together, they can complete the missions together, and get the rewards together,” Kim said. “So doing this, they can enjoy the game with more fun with their squadmates and their clan members.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/27/pubg-key-art-1724780420723.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kim and his team also know that for a community to stay active, they need updates and new content. He stressed that he and the dev team have a clear design philosophy and are very careful about what actually gets incorporated into the game.</p><p>“Through our communication events in Korea, I’ve learned that what is more important is not to do something big, but to do something consistently,” he said. “Our theme is survival, so we do not want to undermine this core gameplay.”</p><p>With a player base as huge and diverse as PUBG’s, player feedback comes from every corner of the world. Different players want different things, some of which directly contradict each other. So Kim and his team have to always keep that design philosophy in mind.</p><p>“For us, community feedback is very important, but we are getting a lot of feedback from many countries and from many types of users,” he said. “Sometimes, feedback is very different, even for just one feature. So we think what is important is we need to incorporate the feedback which is more relevant to our game and also we need to set a benchmark that the incorporation process should not undermine our core gameplay.”</p><p>As always, PUBG: Battlegrounds has plenty for players to look forward to. A zombie mode is on the way, an upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 is in the works long-term, and Kim said there are plans for plenty of other things that he can’t reveal yet. If you want to get in on the action, you can download PUBG: Battlegrounds for free on PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and a mobile version is available on iOS and Android.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle.967833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the actual play series <em>Dimension20</em> wrapped up a live show tour through the UK and Ireland. During this tour, they performed their latest actual play, <em>Dimension20 Time Quangle</em>. For those who couldn't be there in person, Dropout will be bringing the show to VOD.</p>
<h2>The Dimension20 Time Quangle VOD announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of Dimension20 <em>Time Quangle</em> coming to VOD happened via a trailer on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi9jQrvdAuY">Dropout YouTube</a> channel. The trailer itself shows footage from different venues on the tour, showcasing both audience reactions and the performers' showmanship.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension20-time-quangle-brennan-lee-mulligan-screenshot.jpg?itok=6zL3aqLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension20-time-quangle-brennan-lee-mulligan-screenshot.jpg?itok=qBGQrgmr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Dimension20 <em>Time Quangle </em>actual play's central gimmick is that it features characters, players, and locations from different Dimension20 series. Every show is effectively a self-contained improvised remix of <em>Dimension20</em>, with characters, locations, being shuffled around.</p>
<p>As host Brennnan Lee Mulligan says in the trailer, "What if I told you that not only do you not know who we are going to play or what setting it's in, we don't f--king know who we're gonna play or what setting it's in?"</p>
<p>It's an enticing hook since the anthology series has spanned multiple genres. They include <em>Nevermore</em> (Horror), <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-fantasy-high-junior-year-trailer-highlights-new-looks-for-bad-kids-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fantasy High</em></a> (School Drama) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></a> (80s action movie).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the anthology-style presentation makes <em>Dimension20</em> stand out from other actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <em>Legends of Avantris</em>. The liveshow stars Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM, Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, Siobhan Thompson, and Lou Wilson as the players.</p>
<p>According to the video description, the first two shows of <em>Dimension20 Time Quangle</em> will be released September 12 and September 19 on the premium subscription streaming platform, Dropout. The remaining shows will be coming to the platform December 2024.</p>
<p><em>Dimension20</em> is only one major show available on Dropout. The <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/awards/dropout-emmys-game-changer-dimenson-20-ineligible-1235996243/">Emmy-nominated</a> streaming service contains extensive episodes of improvised comedy shows like <em>Make Some Noise</em> and Game Changer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231635/emudeck-machine-steam-machines-crowdfunding<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve once dreamt of building Linux-based game consoles called Steam Machines. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019#:~:text=%E2%80%94Ashley%20Carman-,23.%20Steam%20Machines,-Valve%20Corporation">They flopped</a> — but the dream eventually became reality <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">as the handheld Steam Deck</a> instead. Now, a particularly noteworthy Steam Deck enthusiast is reviving the idea of a console-sized Steam Box, one with his own retro gaming twist.</p><p>Rodrigo Sedano is the founder of <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">EmuDeck</a>, a program beloved by the Steam Deck community. It automatically installs, configures, and enhances emulators for Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and other retro consoles so they work beautifully on Valve’s handheld.</p><p>Now, he wants to make it even easier. He’s preparing to sell you a console-shaped custom gaming PC preloaded with that entire Steam + EmuDeck experience, plus a wireless controller, all ready to go. </p><p>He’s calling them EmuDeck Machines, and he’s <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">currently crowdfunding the idea on Indiegogo</a> for prices starting at around $400 — with an incredibly ambitious promise to ship them in December of this year, just four months from now. </p><p>They’ll house (weak) Intel N97 or (stronger) AMD 8600G chips in a Sega Dreamcast-inspired shell, with four USB ports around front for additional wired controllers or peripherals. By overclocking the AMD 8600G’s integrated Radeon 760M graphics, he claims he can get what looks like Steam Deck-beating performance out of his pricier $700 model:</p><div><figcaption><em>EmuDeck Machine configurations.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: EmuDeck</cite></p></div><p>There are lots of reasons to wait before putting money down on a crowdfunding campaign, though. While I love EmuDeck, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsj/details/experience/">he seems to have</a> other software design, web design, and management experience, he admits to <em>The Verge</em> that he’s never shipped a hardware product like this before. </p><p>He says his US and EU partners are telling him that getting FCC and CE certifications should only take one month. His current prototype is just a Mini-ITX board in a wooden box, while he waits for his potential case manufacturing partners in Spain to deliver the Dreamcast-shaped console case he’s dreamt up. He’s planning to assemble the PCs himself, as a family business of sorts.</p><div><p><strong>A note on crowdfunding:</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter</a>, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div><p>But I think it’s at least <em>plausible</em> because he says he’s not necessarily expecting to sell more than 100 of these as a side project — and because he says these PCs will use off-the-shelf parts. It’s a standard Mini-ITX desktop motherboard and chip, in an 8.66 x 8.66 x 2.55-inch chassis. (He tells me they will have an external 155W power supply.)</p><p>Sedano says he’s been building computers since he was 14 and sees this as a hobby, too, but he’s getting serious about it in a few ways. EmuDeck is now a registered limited liability company in Spain (<a href="https://sede.registradores.org/site/mercantil?lang=en_EN">we checked</a>!), and he says he’s locked down several suppliers to make sure he’ll have the components. He’ll offer hardware support and a warranty, he claims.</p><p>He also may not need Valve’s support to make this a reality; the operating system he’s preloading <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">is Bazzite,</a> a promising fork of the SteamOS interface with a different underlying operating system (Fedora). I’ve loaded it on a Lenovo Legion Go and the ROG Ally X at this point, and I’ve been mostly impressed by how well it works. Bazzite founder Kyle Gospodnetich tells me his team gave EmuDeck their blessing, though Bazzite isn’t currently helping EmuDeck tweak the software.</p><p>It’s a little surprising we haven’t seen many Steam Boxes like this before, and Bazzite says it isn’t aware of any others in the works. Perhaps other companies have been waiting on Valve? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#:~:text=Valve%20hopes%20the%20Steam%20Deck%20will%20inspire%20new%20Steam%20Boxes%2C%20too">The Steam Deck maker told us in late 2022</a> that it’s actually excited for other manufacturers to make small SteamOS PCs — after Valve releases a general image of SteamOS 3 for those manufacturers to use. </p><p>As of this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">there are signs</a> that Valve’s getting closer.</p><p>If you’d rather tinker instead of looking for a turnkey console gaming experience, you could of course build your own Bazzite box with EmuDeck. Or, add an HDMI dock or hub to a handheld. Or, you could possibly even do <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLnxj1ltd5vk">what YouTuber ETA Prime did</a> and turn an old Steam Deck into a mini PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Excited for 2024’s RLCS World Championship? The massive Rocket League event is just around the corner, and competitors are gearing up to take on one another in what will be some of the most intense car-soccer action fans will ever see. </p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about RLCS World Championship 2024, including its prize pool, dates and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-world-championship-2024-prize-pool">RLCS World Championship 2024 Prize Pool</h2>



<p>This year’s RLCS has a massive prize pool of $1,165,500 for which the 16 qualifying teams will be competing for. Here is the official prize pool split:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st:</strong> $300,000</li>



<li><strong>2nd: </strong>$150,000</li>



<li><strong>3rd-4th:</strong> $99,000</li>



<li><strong>5th-6th:</strong> $84,000</li>

<li><strong>12th-14th:</strong> $22,500</li>



<li><strong>15th-16h:</strong> $12,000</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>On top of this massive prize pool, the winners of the RLCS World Championship will also be able to hold high the historic World Championship Trophy. </p>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-world-championship-2024-official-dates">RLCS World Championship 2024 Official Dates</h2>



<p>Curious as to when the RLCS World Championship 2024 is? <strong>The event, which will be taking place at Dickies Arena in Forth Worth, Texas, will be taking place from September 10-15.</strong></p>



<p>With the event inching closer and closer to fruition, many fans are getting excited to see their favorite teams compete against one another, but what teams are actually competing?</p>



<h2 id="h-teams">Teams</h2>



<p>The RLCS World Championship has 16 teams competing this year. Here is a list of everything team competing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gentle Mates Alpine</li>



<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Karmine Corp</li>



<li>G2 Stride</li>



<li>Gen.G Mobil1 Racing</li>



<li>Spacestation Gaming</li>



<li>OG</li>



<li>PWR</li>



<li>QuikTrip Pioneers Gaming</li>



<li>FURIA Esports</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Anything</li>



<li>Gaimin Gladiators</li>



<li>Limitless</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-format">Format</h2>



<p>For this year’s format, we get to see eight teams from the bottom 16 seeds compete against the top eight seeds. Although, there will still be a Swiss stage, where all 16 teams will compete against each other. </p>



<p>The top eight Swiss teams will then be seeded into a single-elimination bracket. What is interesting in this year’s tournament, is the top four Swiss teams will start with two chances before the final four, where teams ranked 5th-8th will only have one life when competing. </p>



<p>That extra life definitely gives the top four Swiss teams a heavy advantage, adding quite a bit of pressure against the other teams. This tournament series is already looking to be incredibly competitive.</p>

Because of that, they claimed, Black Myth: Wukong had not been able to pass bug detection tests and was thus delayed indefinitely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, IGN understands that no tech issue that would delay Black Myth: Wukong has been reported to Xbox. Rather, the Xbox delay is the result of an exclusivity deal neither Game Science nor Sony have publicized, the source said. The source described the rumors of tech issues on Xbox as "inaccurate."</p><p>IGN has reached out to both Game Science and Sony for comment on these reports.</p><p>The new information follows a series of confusing rumors and contradictary statement stretching back to June. Observers first noted the delay when Xbox Series X|S vanished from the Black Myth: Wukong trailer shown during Summer Game Fest. In its <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>, Game Science said that it was still optimizing the Xbox version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>"We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards," Game Science's FAQ read.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-addresses-black-myth-wukongs-delay-on-xbox-series-xs">Microsoft released its own statement</a> on June 21, saying, "We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that."</p><h2>Black Myth: Wukong is a technical monster</h2><p>The rumors of a tech issue were fueled in part by Baldur's Gate 3's Xbox saga in 2023, which saw the Xbox version delayed until December due to difficulties optimizing for Xbox Series S. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-reveals-impressive-optimization-efforts-for-xbox-series-s-port-of-baldurs-gate-3">Larian was eventually forced to remove split-screen co-op from the Xbox Series S version</a> in order to get Baldur's Gate 3 to Microsoft's platform.</p><p>The rumors were given further credence by the fact that Black Myth: Wukong is a technical monster, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">our review noting that its fidelity was enough to even make a top-end rig with an RTX 4090 sweat</a>. Game Science has apologized for any tech problems players encountered, and today <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-patch-10814860-makes-some-crucial-fixes-and-nerfs-one-boss-in-particular">released a 1.6 GB patch with various fixes and adjustments</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One way or another, Black Myth: Wukong is doing just fine, pushing Steam to an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-lifts-steam-to-37-million-concurrent-players-for-first-time">incredible 37 million concurrent players</a> for the first time earlier this week.

The developer revealed Runewords as an expansion-exclusive feature that will let players combine runes in order to essentially craft new abilities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux9zeqdMF-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To create a Runeword, players will need to combine a Rune of Ritual and a Rune of Invocation. These effectively serve as a resource generator and a resource spender, respectively. The Rune of Ritual will specify a type of action that must be done in order to activate it, with an example being casting a skill with a cooldown. Fulfilling that Rune of Ritual will generate a new resource, Offering, which is then used in turn to activate the Runeword's Rune of Invocation. If a player has more Offering than what the Rune of Invocation requires, they gain Overflow, which grants that Runeword bonus effects that are proportional to the amount of Overflow.</p><p dir="ltr">Only two Runewords will be equipable at a time, and they will use the same sockets that currently are used for gems. The same Runeword can't be equipped twice, and there are three rarities of each rune, with higher rarities being more powerful. Runes can be acquired throughout the Vessel of Hatred expansion, but there will be a specific area, The Undercity, where players can farm for them as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The powers gained from Runewords can have a variety of effects. One Runeword, for example, will grant players access to the Sorcerer's Teleport ability. Another will channel the Druid's Petrify skill, stunning enemies and increasing damage dealt to them. In total, Blizzard said each class will have two skills and one Legendary Aspect represented in the pool of possible Runewords.</p><p dir="ltr">Runes can also be used for crafting. Combining three of the same Rune will create a new rune, with a chance of it rolling at a higher rarity. Runes in conjunction with a Resplendent Spark can also be used to craft certain Mythic Unique items, giving players yet another way to obtain some of the game's most sought after items.</p><p dir="ltr">Runewords are just one of the new features coming in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion on October 8</a>.

Red Thread Games’ adventure/rhythm/beat-em-up hybrid has its strengths, and when it’s functioning as a socially conscious, modern version of a Telltale Games adventure, the lives of its merry band of superpowered misfits are genuinely engrossing. When it tries to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dustborn-impressions-preview-characters-combat-rhythm-1851630273&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dustborn-impressions-preview-characters-combat-rhythm-1851630273">below-average beat-em-up</a></span> that trades relationship-building for some of the flimsiest action combat I’ve experienced this side of the Wii era, however, I’m less enthralled.</p><p><em>Dustborn </em>feels as if it’s trying to explore too many things, making the end result come off like a rough draft of every possible idea the team had for the game. It’s filled to the brim with mechanics, characters, and themes that sometimes feel contrived and underbaked, as if they were an idea someone wanted to incorporate whether the game had the bandwidth to incorporate it thoughtfully or not. Its cast of (mostly) superpowered nomads is as diverse in background and culture as you’d expect of a group growing larger as it travels across a dystopian America, but as their tour bus fills up, it becomes clear not every character is going to get the same room to grow as others.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-recommend-id="image://6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo scratches his chin while Pax and others stand behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Theo scratches his chin while Pax and others stand behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-recommend-id="image://6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo scratches his chin while Pax and others stand behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It was around midway through <em>Dustborn</em> that I realized not all characters were created equal. Pax, the hero of our story, meets nearly a dozen people who join her and her friends’ cross-country road trip, and at the start, each of these characters has a distinct path you can set them on depending on your choices. For example, Theo, the boss of this group of mutant smugglers making their way across America, can end up viewing Pax and her crew as his equals, his employees, or as surrogate children by the end of <em>Dustborn</em>. The game is constantly reminding you that some of his responses are determined by how you’ve been treating him throughout the game, and will ultimately culminate in a specific ending based on your relationship. It’s an interesting, albeit on-the-nose, way of letting you see how the way you treat someone can affect their worldview.<br></p><p>However, this mechanic is never implemented for cast members who show up in the second half of the game. Instead, those less malleable characters end up feeling like narrative devices designed to get Pax and friends out of a sticky situation or manufacture drama that never actually materializes, and they ultimately feel like little more than an idea that wasn’t cooked long enough. This problem extends beyond the game’s character writing and bleeds into a story that cannot seem to pick a lane.</p><p><em>Dustborn</em> starts out straightforward enough. Pax, her friend Sai, and her ex Noam are all working with a man named Theo as an undercover punk band smuggling a data key across an alt-future version of America. In this world, President John F. Kennedy wasn’t the one killed in his 1963 assassination attempt. Instead, it was his wife Jackie Kennedy who lost her life, and in reaction to this loss, the president founded Justice, a policing force that descended into fascism, especially when targeting “Anomals,” superpowered individuals who can affect different elements with their voice. For example, Pax can create negative feelings with her vocals whereas Noam can calm a heightened situation. The group has to make it across the country undetected in order to finish the job and reach a better life.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-recommend-id="image://6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax looks at a sign depicting an older JFK repping Justice For America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax looks at a sign depicting an older JFK repping Justice For America." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-recommend-id="image://6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax looks at a sign depicting an older JFK repping Justice For America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That in and of itself is a strong enough foundation for this road trip, but every time Pax’s tour bus stopped, I knew I was going to meet another character, find out about some other layer to the country-wide conspiracy our heroes are contending with, or learn something new about this crew. By the time I was halfway across America, <em>Dustborn </em>already felt like it was caving under the weight of its ambition. It’s clear the team wanted to touch on different cultures, conflicts, themes, relationships, and character archetypes, but every time it expanded its focus I could feel it losing sight of the strong baseline it had already established. Eventually, the grounded stories started to feel like they were getting lost in the noise.<br></p><p>There are parts of <em>Dustborn </em>I don’t think I could even coherently describe to you because they came and went so fast I don’t think I quite got what the game was going for. Entire sections feel like detours to a different story that wasn’t finished, with constant escalations and deescalations of stakes and giant lore drops that feel disconnected from moment to moment. <em>Dustborn</em> is at its best when it’s examining how a group of persecuted people navigate the cynical endgame of a fascist America and still try to find hope and connection. So often, those ideas are derailed by ineloquent genre-blending that never pays off. Entire characters are swallowed whole in the final moments as they get fed into the gaping maw of convoluted turns <em>Dustborn</em> takes, and I’m left wondering why the game had to balloon into this cluttered katamari of disparate elements when it was already doing enough.</p><figure id="" data-id="34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-recommend-id="image://34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax holds a bat on her shoulder over a broken robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax holds a bat on her shoulder over a broken robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-recommend-id="image://34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax holds a bat on her shoulder over a broken robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I wrestle with the big picture because I really, <em>really</em> enjoyed the smaller moments in <em>Dustborn</em>. Before it started adding characters for characters’ sake, it<em> </em>had me wrapped around its finger as I watched sisters reconnect, downtrodden people find hope within each other, and a group of oppressed people fight for their freedom in an unjust world. Those were the moments that kept me going when a new contrivance or convoluted twist derailed what I was here to see. But ultimately, those were the least intrusive parts of <em>Dustborn</em>, as the combat remains the most egregious things the game adds on top of its already too-full plate. It’s annoyingly imprecise, its bells and whistles from Pax’s arsenal of vocal attacks don’t add enough interesting flair to give the game its own identity, and the only real redeeming part of it is that it gives you the option right out the gate to do it less.<br></p><p>The game’s rhythm sequences, in which you play as the titular Dustborn punk band, fare a bit better and are challenging enough, but I never looked forward to them because I frankly found the music lacking. Maybe that was intentional, considering Dustborn is just a cover for a smuggling operation, but I’m not booting any of these songs up on Spotify. <em>Dustborn</em> constantly bites off more than it can chew, even for quick gags like an entire turn-based battle sequence that pays homage to RPG classics. It’s not even that these ideas are inherently unsound, it’s that the execution never matches the highs of its relationship writing.</p><figure id="" data-id="ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-recommend-id="image://ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dustborn hovers over an injured Pax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dustborn hovers over an injured Pax." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-recommend-id="image://ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dustborn hovers over an injured Pax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I feel like I’ve spent the majority of this review dogpiling on a game I mostly enjoyed. Maybe that’s because I’m frustrated by the squandered potential smothered under a pile of excess, like someone unwilling to say “when” to the person holding the Olive Garden cheese grater. Part of me feels like I need a game like <em>Dustborn </em>right now; one that believes that people joining together can change the world and that despite how fucked everything is around them, there is still something to fight for. I think as I’ve gotten older, I’ve started backsliding into the same cynicism I felt as a teenager. I’ve watched the world get worse around me as those who held me up have been beaten down just as hard. How long must we stand together and fight against systems that would rather we lay down and die before things change? How much fight do I have left in me to find out? Large parts of <em>Dustborn </em>poked at my anxiety about the state of the world, and despite its unabashed belief that Pax and her friends could make the world a better place, I feel myself becoming more jaded at the notion. Perhaps the world, much like <em>Dustborn</em>, isn’t as easily definable as good or bad, just full of good people trying to make the most of the situation they’re in. I want to believe as much as the game does, and maybe that belief is enough for me to look past its overambition.<br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're familiar with the name EmuDeck, you're likely a Steam Deck owner looking for <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">an easy and user-friendly way to run emulators on your Steam Deck handheld</a>. Now, <a href="https://github.com/dragoonDorise">one of the coders</a> behind that software suite is dipping their toes into branded gaming hardware with <a href="https://x.com/EmuDeck/status/1829172047559397518">the EmuDeck Machines project</a>, now seeking <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">funding on IndieGogo</a>.</p>
<p>The EmuDeck Machines obviously come with EmuDeck software preinstalled to let users easily "play your retro games from your couch." But they also promise to let you run games from Steam and other popular PC launchers through the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Linux-based, gaming-focused Bazzite OS</a>. The vibe is definitely similar to that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">Valve's own aborted Steam Machines effort</a> from years back, albeit in a less "official" capacity.
</p><p>"I used to be a PC guy but in the last 20 years I switched to the Mac and in the Apple ecosystem choosing a computer is easy," project lead DragoonDorise told Ars in an email. "But then I found myself wanting a gaming rig so I started my search and boy oh boy I was lost. The PC industry seems to be trying to trick you every step of the way, gazillions of options, hard to understand what's good and what's not. If you are tech savvy it's not hard, you know what to get and what to avoid. Then it hit me, I made emulation easy with EmuDeck, why not make hardware easy too?"</p>
<p>"The idea behind the EmuDeck Machine is to make hardware easy just as EmuDeck did with software," DragoonDorise <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/this-is-emudeck-110939776">writes on the EmuDeck Patreon</a>. "This is not focused to tech savvy people. It's for people that want a no-hassle experience, just buy and play," they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6751/">added on Reddit</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>What’s inside?</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/emudeckspecs.jpg" data-height="1420" data-width="1350" alt="The EM1 is tuned for older emulators and games, while the EM2 promises to run more recent software."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/emudeckspecs.jpg" data-height="1420" data-width="1350">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The EM1 is tuned for older emulators and games, while the EM2 promises to run more recent software.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The EmuDeck Machines come in two promised configurations. On the low-end EM1 model, a $365 early bird price gets you an Intel N97-based system with 8GB of RAM and no dedicated graphics card. That's enough to run a game on the order of <em>Hades</em> at a smooth 60 fps and run emulators of systems through the PS2/Wii era.</p>
<p>Upgrading to the $676 EM2 gets you an overclocked Radeon 760M GPU and an upgrade to 16GB of RAM. That promises smooth gaming performance for high-end games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Returnal</em>, according to DragoonDorise, as well as support for PS3 and Xbox 360 emulators. If the Indiegogo project is fully funded, DragoonDorise also promises an optional Docking Station will be made available next year to provide "Radeon 7600" graphics power to the EM2.</p>
<p>Both models come with 512GB of storage, which can be upgraded with external USB hard drives and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMCPY4VG/?tag=arstech20-20">Gamesir wireless controller</a>. It all comes packaged in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6ad2/">8.6-inch square case</a> that's clearly inspired by the Sega Dreamcast, with four USB ports where the usual controller ports would be.</p>
<h2>Caveat emptor</h2>
<p>Though DragoonDorise says they currently only have a "working prototype" of the EmuDeck Machines, the IndieGogo project promises an ambitious schedule where hardware will be shipping by December. "The only thing I'm missing right now is the shell, all the rest is already taken care of, " DragoonDorise told Ars. "Where I'm gonna get my components, cables, etc. all of that is already spoken for. And the times I posted in IGG are according what my manufacturer told me. If we end up having any delay I'll just be transparent with my backers."</p>
<p>Should potential backers worry that a software coder is pivoting to hardware for the first time? "I have experience with distribution as I used to run an online store back in the day selling hundreds of devices per month," DragoonDorise tells Ars. "I've never been on the side of the manufacturer, though, but you know what? When I started coding EmuDeck the most I knew about Linux was how to change directories and little more and that ended up being a big success because I cared about the project, I believed it could be something that people will love to use. This is the same, my heart is poured in this thing."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/emudeckschedule.jpg" data-height="1488" data-width="1330" alt="The proposed schedule for production and shipping seems ambitious, to say the least."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/emudeckschedule.jpg" data-height="1488" data-width="1330">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The proposed schedule for production and shipping seems ambitious, to say the least.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, though, DragoonDorise's comments make the EmuDeck Machines effort sound more like a fun hobby than an attempt at an ongoing business. "This is a project I'm doing mostly for fun, just like EmuDeck," they told Ars. "I built a mini ITX PC... and I thought, 'Hey this is cool, let's do this,'" they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj5dya/">wrote on Reddit</a>. "I've always dream[ed] of making a video console, so this it," they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6n1l/">continued in another Reddit comment</a>.
</p><p>As of this writing, the EmuDeck Machines effort has attracted nearly $13,000 in pledges in just under 24 hours. But DragoonDorise tells Ars he's making just $50 on each unit sale, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6k61/">writes on Reddit</a> that they're "not trying to get rich here with this, I'm not even expecting to make money. I'm doing this because I think [it] is a fun project and I thought people would like it."</p>
<p>In the Patreon comments, DragoonDorise adds that they tried to make the machines affordable for customers, but that "Indiegogo takes a big cut... they are going to make more money than I will."</p>
<p>For fans of the EmuDeck software, DragoonDorise also promises on Patreon that work on EmuDeck Machines hardware "doesn't mean things will change on the software side of EmuDeck, if anything it will bring more features." In fact, features like <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/emudeck-2-2-3-2-96522491">CloudSync</a>, <a href="https://emudeck.github.io/tools/steamos/steam-rom-manager/">ROM Library</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/EmuDeck/EmuDecky">the EmuDecky plugin</a> were added to EmuDeck "because I envisioned the EmuDeck Machine with those features so many months ago," they write, "and those have ended up being in the regular EmuDeck for every one of you."</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> will receive some huge changes alongside its Vessel of Hatred expansion, changes that include a complete restructuring of the game's difficulty system and its endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed during a recent (very lengthy) livestream, Blizzard has announced World Tiers, Diablo 4's current difficulty system, will be removed. In their place will be a system that is much more similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>. Players will journey through Normal, Hard, Expert, and Penitent difficulty before reaching the start of the endgame at Torment 1 difficulty. Each difficulty will see players earn additional XP and gold.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux9zeqdMF-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Unlocking the new Torment difficulties will be tied directly to progressing through the Pit endgame activity introduced in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn update</a> earlier this year. There will be four Torment difficulties in total, with each difficulty representing a significant increase in challenge. Players will only be able to unlock Torment 1 after conquering Pit Tier 20, after which subsequent difficulties will be unlocked every 15 Pit Tiers. The highest level of the Pit will be Tier 100, but each tier will be more challenging than in the current version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Torment difficulty will be where players start to find the best items. Sacred items will be removed entirely, while Ancestral items are being reworked to only drop at Torment difficulties and to be more rare. However, they will also be much more powerful, as they will have a guaranteed Greater Affix stat and feature more potent Legendary powers. Higher Torment tiers will reward more Ancestral items, rewarding players who push the game's highest difficulties.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the game's difficulty changes are to make Diablo 4 feel more consistent across its various content, instead of the difficulty varying wildly in the current version of the game depending on what endgame activity you are pursuing.</p><p dir="ltr">The difficulty changes will go hand-in-hand with upcoming changes to leveling and the Paragon system in Diablo 4. The level cap come Update 2.0 will be reduced to 60 (down from 100), while Paragon points unlocked through leveling will be shared across all characters on a realm i.e., the Eternal, Hardcore, and Seasonal realms. As players predicted, this will coincide with a numbers value squish for damage and health, making the game more readable instead of bosses having trillions of health and players dealing billions of damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will actually be able to earn more Paragon points come the update, but there will be a five Paragon board limit. Blizzard said this change is to encourage players to fill out each board more, instead of simply rushing to each Glyph node. Each class will receive a new board, and each existing board will be rebalanced accordingly.</p><p dir="ltr">With the release of Vessel of Hatred, Paragon Glyphs will be upgraded by doing the Pit instead of Nightmare dungeons (which will instead reward Masterwork materials). Instead of an XP system used to level up Glyphs, it will instead be a chance or fail system, where players will have a guaranteed chance to upgrade their Glyph if completing a Pit tier 10 levels or more higher than the Glyph's current level and a less than 100% chance when completing lower level Pit tiers. Glyphs will have a new max rank of 100, and will see a radius increase at rank 15 and 46. Rank 46 will also upgrade the Glyph to a Legendary Glyph, after which it will gain a powerful, multiplicative stat bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">All of those changes will be in addition to Vessel of Hatred's new class, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">the Spiritborn</a>, new skills for each class, the return of Mercenaries, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">addition of runewords from Diablo 2</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">group-based endgame dungeon, the Dark Citadel</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred releases October 8</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna have announced a strategic partnership, which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>In a statement, Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertainment, said<em> “At Remedy, our primary focus continues to be what we do best—crafting industry-defining video games that have earned us global recognition. Now, the time is right to expand the reach of Remedy’s beloved franchises to an even broader global audience through film, television, and more. In Annapurna, we have found an outstanding partner who shares our ambition and passion for immersive storytelling. We are excited to see them bring the universes and characters we have created to life in new mediums, thanks to this unique deal.”&nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>“The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television, and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life,”</em> said Megan Ellison, Founder and CEO of Annapurna. <em>“By leveraging Remedy’s innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums.”</em></p>
<p>Previously, Remedy had a co-development partnership for Control 2 with 505 Games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/28/remedy-acquires-the-rights-to-the-control-series-from-505-games-includes-control-2-and-condor/">Remedy acquired the rights to the Control series from 505 Games</a>, which included Control 2 and the co-op project Concord. In May, Remedy did announce the cancellation of another co-op game that had the codename<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/remedy-cancels-co-op-multiplayer-title-project-kestrel/"> Project Kestrel</a>, and this was in development with Tencent as a partner.</p>

<p>There have been attempts in the past to bring Alan Wake to the movie screen before, stretching all the way back to 2010. And back in 2020, Gary Whitta expressed interest in writing a script for a Control movie, though this has not gone anywhere. Who knows? Maybe Gary will get the call up to write the movie now.</p>

            <p>
Against the Storm - the critically acclaimed city building roguelike from Eremite Games - is set to get its first major expansion, titled Keepers of the Stone, on 26th September this year.
</p>
<p>
Against the Storm, if you're unfamiliar, challenges players to survive the apocalyptic Blightstorm ravaging the kingdom by gradually upgrading the Smoldering City at its heart. That requires setting out across multiple biomes and establishing a series of settlements, success in each location only coming if players can meet the Scorched Queen's endless demands.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to the newly announced Keepers of the Stone expansion. This promises to build on the base game's already superb action by introducing, firstly, the Coastal Groves biome, where settlements start along the water. Here, players can build the Strider Port, enabling them to launch expeditions for treasures lost in the surrounding depths.

<p>
Keepers of the Stone also introduces the Frogs - a new species joining the existing Humans, Beavers, Lizards, Harpies, and Foxes - who are particularly proficient with stone masonry, enjoy the rain, and can increase the rate at which new citizens join settlements. Frogs also demand special upgradable Frog Houses, rather than the usual shelters.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the expansion adds new upgrade tree rewards in the Smoldering City - all intended to benefit the Frogs - alongside three new Legendary Cornerstones, one new Epic Cornerstone, three new Rare perks, and five new Uncommon perks. Additionally, it brings 12 new orders reflecting the Frogs and their capabilities, plus 14 new music tracks.
</p>
<p>
Keepers of the Stone launches via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3075500/Against_the_Storm__Keepers_of_the_Stone/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/against_the_storm_keepers_of_the_stone">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/against-the-storm--keepers-of-the-stone">Epic</a>, and the Windows Store on 26th September (no price has been announced just yet), and will be accompanied by a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1336490/announcements/detail/4258802537449103613?snr=2___">substantial free base game update</a>. This introduces fishing - enabling players to acquire resources from variously sized ponds in glades, providing they build a Fishing Hut first - as well as an increased level cap, new buildings and resources, plus various balance changes and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>
"It's a pleasure to play something where every detail takes you back to the heart of what a game excels at," Eurogamer contributor Ruth Cassidy wrote in their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/against-the-storm-review-a-perfectly-chaotic-city-builder">five star review of Against the Storm</a> last year. "Every layer... reveals something more compelling than the layer above it - where that layer stands as something already deeply interesting in its own right."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2 is real, and it's promising. I can confirm as much after having had the chance to try a brief demo of Episode 1 during Gamescom 2024. This sequel has had to go through an untold number of hurdles, starting with the cancellation of the original project (announced in 2010) and the disbandment of Ukrainian developer GSC Game World.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after a few years, the studio was reformed. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, the team went on to make STALKER 2 at long last. However, the troubles were far from over, starting with the Russian invasion of Ukraine that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> them to stop development for a while and relocate to Prague, and there was even an office <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-suffers-office-fire-due-to-electrical-installation-malfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fire</a> at some point.</p>
<p>The game is now basically complete, however, and it also looked fairly polished from what little I played. Granted, it would be impossible to even attempt to judge a game this big after a half-hour session where players were also left to understand the mechanics on their own. Still, the Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals certainly look great, and the atmosphere is top-notch.</p>
<p>After the hands-on, I chatted with Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka and PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov to discuss the game's short road to release. As a reminder, STALKER 2 will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X on November 20, and it will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце Чорнобиля — Developer Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bi17nPEG7jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>First of all, I wanted to ask how the team is doing. It would be a big understatement to say you've been through a lot. Now that you are so close to the finish line, what does it feel like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:</strong> I would say there's all kinds of anxiety and excitement. We are preparing both versions of the game, including a build for Microsoft, because we need to pass through the certification for the Xbox version, and we need to do it in advance. Starting yesterday, we also started to receive public opinions from Gamescom, and it was pure anxiety.</p>
<p>Currently, it's slightly changing because we see the reception and we see that actually people like what we are delivering. Having this kind of feedback from the fans is something that reinforces the team spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Last year, at Gamescom 2023, you allowed people to play STALKER 2 for the first time. How did last year's hands-on allow you to gather feedback, and what did you improve based on that feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>We had a lot to process. We were observing what the majority of the players were feeling. We also had a strike team discussing their impressions daily on what the players were doing in the demo and what they talked about. Based on that, we reshaped the way AI performs their actions, how they choose their targets, and how they fight against the player. Most essentially, we have redone the dialogue system, so talking to other NPCs became, I would say, more fluid and more natural. I guess there were many more tiny things that improved, too.</p>
<p><strong>Performance, too, I'd wager.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yes, but that is something that we didn't just gather from the users' feedback. We just knew it had to be done. If you play on Xbox Series X, you will see the console version running at 60 frames per second, which is proof of all the efforts of our team in terms of performance.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> I must say that the overall feedback that we had from last year's event had a big impact on our decision to postpone STALKER 2 because it was the first time people played it. All of them said it was a true STALKER experience, shaping up nicely, but still needed some time in an oven. Since we don't have a publisher and it actually, of course, costs us money, but we don't have a publisher, so we have a certain degree of freedom of deciding when to release. So that was really useful in terms of gathering this feedback together to actually improve the game, postpone, and take time to polish certain things. We're super glad that we actually showed it, that people played it, and that we learned there were certain ways to go to improve on our way to release.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that you are self-publishing, but you do have a partnership with Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> That's right. That's a Game Pass partnership and Microsoft is not pushing us in any way to release on any date or just put the content out of the game or something like that. Actually, Microsoft, they are super supportive of us. We didn't exactly ask someone from Microsoft to be our friends, but Sarah Bond is obviously a friend of the game. Phil (Spencer) was super supportive, all the teams from Microsoft were. They didn't put any additional pressure on us. So basically, we're self-publishing, and then we have a Game Pass deal with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Did they help you with the optimization of the Xbox versions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Well, our team is mature enough to take care of many aspects of the game themselves. Yet, the Xbox team knows best how the Xbox performs and what's better to do in a case like we need to go deeper into the optimization. The Microsoft team visited several times, providing essential expertise on what else we could do that we didn't think of. It's not over yet. Aside from Xbox Series X, we're still working on optimization for Xbox Series S. It's going well, and the Xbox team is contributing a lot.</p>
<p><strong>I guess the Xbox Series S is the toughest platform to optimize for because it's weaker than the others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>In our case, it's quite achievable. On Xbox Series X, we have two available modes. One of them is Performance Mode, where the game is running with 60 FPS and slightly different graphics than in Quality Mode, which looks super awesome with all the reflections and high-resolution textures, but runs at 30 FPS. We are trying to achieve a similar experience on Xbox Series S by combining these two approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean it will run at 30 FPS on the Xbox Series S with the same settings as the X's 60 FPS mode?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Not yet. So far, we have it at 25ish FPS on the Xbox Series S, but we still have space to optimize.</p>

<p><strong>On the PC side, you're working with NVIDIA, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yes. We are going to have software ray tracing. As for hardware ray tracing, it's too early for us, but we are experimenting with that. We are trying to have it on the release date, but it is highly unlikely you will have it at launch. But NVIDIA DLSS will be there.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, let's talk about the game itself. Have you shared an estimate of how long it will take to complete STALKER 2 on average?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>So far, I can judge only through the playthroughs me and my colleagues I had my colleagues had, but you know, when we play, we are way different from each other, as we are focusing on different stuff. I would say it will take approximately 25 to 40 hours to beat the game, and yet, within one playthrough, you won't see all the content we have because the story is nonlinear, and your decisions impact what you're going to see and some locations will change based on the decisions you made. So, I would say that to beat the game once, it will take 25 to 40 hours. But to see the whole game, you would need several playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>I know you confirmed that there will be several endings to the story. Can you share how many?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>I think it was just confirmed yesterday on IGN, so it's super fresh. It will be three.</p>
<p><strong>On the game's Steam page, it says that you'll support mods. Can you discuss that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yeah. STALKER is a known franchise not only because of the games but also because of the support from the mod community, which has thrived for the last 15 years, and we don't really want to abandon these people. So, after the release, I can't say when exactly, but we want to do it as close as possible to the release date, we will have the official mod support. We are cooking up some new, interesting initiatives for next year.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to distribute the mod tools?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to download mods in STALKER 2, or is it going to be out of the game like most PC mods?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>That's something to be defined, but we are striving to support both PC and console.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>Yeah, we're actually already supporting them with Mod.io in the original trilogy. I can't confirm whether it's going to be Mod.io or something else for STALKER 2. But the thing is, the modding scene is a little bit of a Wild West right now where you need to download files, replace files, et cetera, so we want to make it structured. There are certain ways on the market to make it structured: Steamworks, Mod.io, and others. We're exploring, we're playing for that, and we want to do it as close to release as possible, but we cannot just guarantee it's going to be on the release, but we are doing our best efforts to be there on time.</p>
<p><strong>You also mentioned multiplayer support coming after release. What else can you say about it, if anything? How long after the release, and what would it be like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I don't think we have many updates on that side. We are now fully concentrated on single player.</p>
<p><strong>Is it still planned to be relatively soon after release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is supposed to be an update after the release.</p>
<p><strong>A free update?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Yes. But for now, we're making the single player as polished as possible. Everything connected to multiplayer probably belongs to our post-launch phase, so we just don't have an update on that right now.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Multiplayer is supposed to be a free update coming after launch.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. Putting aside the multiplayer topic, are you going to continue to improve STALKER 2 post-launch with new features?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>First of all, we are going to have to do the story DLCs. These will be huge story DLCs which would expand on the story of the characters and the zone itself. Before the DLCs are released, we will provide several free updates for all players. You shouldn't expect any cut quests because we are not cutting anything from the story. Yet, there are a few things that our team wants to deliver, but we know they're tiny things that will be very nice for the players, but they can wait till the post-release. So, you can expect several free updates along with the patches and bug fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>We're crafting a game that we really hope, and we're working hard on that, will not be a game to be forgotten two weeks after release. As Slava said, we're going to support it. At the moment, we're doing our best efforts to polish the game. If there is anything not quite there, of course, we're going to fix it post-launch just to make it technically better. At the same time, we plan to support this game for a while, so it's not just something to be released and forgotten.</p>
<p>Obviously, the three DLCs are part of this plan to keep it updated. Probably, part of our efforts will be dedicated to the technical stage until the release, and then we're going to continue with free updates and DLCs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What are you doing with the additional time you have with this last two-month <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delayed-november-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>It's specifically to improve polish. During this period, we are fully focusing on fixes and optimization. We are not adding anything new; we just want to make sure that the players will get the best experience on the release date, so that's why we needed this additional amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>And to spend some more money on that as well, because it's a big team and we're basically financing the game ourselves, so it's also additional expenses for us. That's the other side of the delays that not everyone talks about</p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Everything comes at a price.</p>
<p><strong>That's why publishers often say no, just release the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>Probably yes, so not having a publisher is nice. We can spend more money *laughs*.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the team at GSC Game World right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>430 plus. New members come in constantly; I think it was 430 plus when I checked last time, so somewhere around there, all working on one game.</p>
<p><strong>That's more than I expected. I mean, CD PROJEKT has fewer developers working on the new The Witcher game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>Do you want a fun fact? This guy (Slava) worked on Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We are 430 plus. New members come in constantly; I think it was 430 plus when I checked last time, so somewhere around there, all working on one game.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Interesting. What can you tell me about the A-Life 2.0 AI system? What kind of behaviors will fans notice while playing STALKER 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>In every region, with some slight exceptions, you may run into encounters that will be generated based on where you are, what's happening around you, and what happened before. Let's say that a couple of NPCs go near an Anomaly, they start to fight each other, another NPC someone steps in the fight and dies. You can observe all that. But this part of A-Life is quite simple because it's based on the generic components: NPC, mutant, Anomaly. There are also special encounters, which are little bit tiny stories, and all of them have their own specifics, and they'll be able to be more interesting, I would say, showing off how the AI works. There can be quite unexpected events.</p>
<p><strong>Can you help NPCs during these encounters?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Typically, it's something about finding someone's stash. These are simple tasks. Every Stalker scattered stashes across the zone to keep their stuff. Maybe someone sends you there to pick it up, yet something happens along the way or around the stash. That is one of the examples of the short stories you'll encounter in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-debuts-new-harry-potter-quidditch-champions-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games released a new Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions trailer. This trailer gives those excited for the game an exclusive look into the gameplay, specifically the PvP mode, the customization, skill trees, the various Broom upgrades, Career mode and much more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions - Official Launch Gameplay Walkthrough Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMJpa5uyugw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is just over five minutes, giving players glimpses into everything they could possibly need to know about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-pre-orders-available-now/">Harry Potter game</a>. For those who prefer a solo experience, the career mode starts at the Weasley Burrow in the Garden Cup, where you'll get to face off against familiar faces from the iconic franchise while fully customizing your character to look however you want them to.</p>
<p>You get to represent one of the great three wizarding schools, Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Durmstrung Institute, or Hogwarts School of Wizardry at the Triwizard Schools Quidditch Cup. If you are successful in your competitions, you'll be able to go on to the ultimate challenge of competing at the Quidditch World Cup.</p>
<p>Compared to other games that are out, the abilities and customization you can unlock in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions are purely through in-game progression, and none of it can be bought with real-life currency. To unlock new abilities and customization, players will have to work to get skill points that can allow them to access special moves and broom upgrades. The broom upgrades allow players to move faster, gain more agility, and more to help them become a Quidditch champion.</p>
<p>For those who are excited about the PvP element of the game, you can choose your role, which can be either a Chaser, Keeper, Beater, or Seeker, much like the traditional roles that are shown in the movies. While you can choose the role you control, you also have to control an additional Chaser as well.</p>
<p>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions<a href="https://www.quidditchchampions.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> releases on September 3, 2024</a> for the digital editions, which will be available across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and PC. For those who want the game's physical edition, you'll have to wait until November 8, 2024. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be released some time during the holiday season, but there isn't a specific set date for it yet.</p>
<p>For those who may be on the fence about purchasing Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, the game will be available to PlayStation Plus members at no additional cost from September 3 through September 30, 2024. Those playing it via PlayStation Plus will also get an additional redeemable cosmetic they can use in-game.</p>
