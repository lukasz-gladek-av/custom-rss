<p>Improvements to vehicles, photo mode, and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0650ed79dac82/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">has released</a> yet another patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on Switch 2, introducing a number of fixes and improvements to vehicles, photo mode, quests, the open world, and more.</p>
<p>One of the key improvements is the implementation of AutoDrive, which would previously be a bit hit and miss – quite literally. It seems this has now been smoothed out, allowing vehicles to avoid obstacles a bit better and make navigation generally a bit more pleasant.</p>
<p>It's kind of remarkable to see the team at CDPR continue to apply improvements to Cyberpunk five years after its initial release. Yes, the game was a bit of a mess at launch, but it's since been moulded into what might be one of the best open world games of all time. Heck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG9Hn3aT7jo">our lovely video producer Alex thinks so</a>, anyway!</p>
<p>So let's check out the full patch notes...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated AutoDrive. When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Johnny always spawned in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applying CrystalCoat to the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru caused its wheels to flash in different colors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Photo Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work with any gender.</li>
<li>Disabled NPC collision, which will make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision (e.g. on car hoods).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the poses didn't work for Royce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freedom</em> - Fixed the journal entry that appears when the player chooses not to steal the Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred."</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath</em> - Fixed an issue where, after V fails to pursue and stop Semimaru and receives a text from River saying he'll contact V soon, the follow-up message never arrives.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath -</em> Fixed an issue where the Yaiba Semimaru could flip over during the chase, preventing the player from entering it.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath -</em> It's no longer possible to trigger the quest if River died during <em>The Hunt</em>.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath</em> - Players can now acquire the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru through AUTOFIXER even if they failed <em>The Hunt</em>, which normally unlocks the side quest where the vehicle is obtained.</li>
<li><em>Nitro (Youth Energy)</em> - Fixed a game crash that could occur in certain circumstances after leaving the Yaiba showroom event.</li>
<li><em>Nitro (Youth Energy)</em> - Fixed an issue where the proxy interface UI in the Yaiba showroom is cut off when the "Larger HUD Elements" setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several localization and lipsync issues in various languages.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to disable vignette. It can be found in Settings → Graphics → Basic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on PC and Mac where Ray-Traced Reflections might not display correctly when enabled under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with displaying text messages from Delamain.</li>
<li>Various fixes for fluff vendors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The patch is out now, so hopefully you've got it downloaded already, but if not, simply boot up your Switch 2 and this should trigger the download automatically.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-2-gamescom-preview-climbing-the-charts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-straight-roads-2-gamescom-preview-%E2%80%93-climbing-the-charts.1294662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in 2020, Malaysian game development studio Metronomik released <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-release-august-25/">No Straight Roads</a>, an action-adventure game deeply rooted in music coming with a distinct visual style, and some great boss battles that made it easy to look past the general simplicity of the entire experience. After releasing the Encore Edition featuring additional content, the development studio started working on No Straight Roads 2, a sequel that promises to significantly expand every one of its predecessor's features, from music to gameplay.</p>



<p>During last month's Gamescom, I had the opportunity to meet with Metronomik co-founder and Game Director Wan Hazmer and Business Development Manager Rie Matsuura to talk about the second entry in their series. Much like in 2019, when I met him during the very last <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-hands-on-preview/">E3 in Los Angeles</a> to to talk about the original, Wan Hazmer was very enthusiasiastic about the project, and I feel he had every right to be, as No Straight Roads 2 immediately felt like a massive step up over its predecessor, which did a lot of things right, but whose relatively small scope ultimately impacted the experience negatively.</p>



<p>With No Straight Roads 2, Metronomik is not taking any chances. Bunk Bed Junction is not only heading out of Vinyl City for the first time, but they are also expanding the band, as keyboard player Casey and another yet-to-be-revealed band member will join guitarist Mayday and drummer Zuke. And, for the first time, they will feel like an actual band playing together, as all characters will actually participate in combat when not controlled by any player, fighting mobs and bosses together. The introduction of mobs is only one of the things made possible by Metronomik getting bigger as a game development studio, as the support from publisher Shueisha Games and the addition of more developers allowed the creation of a proper AI system for mobs and characters, but also the creation of much bigger stages that will address the extreme linearity of the original.</p>

<p>The unique combination of music and action gameplay of the original is also getting significantly expanded in No Straight Roads 2, as the new entry in the series will explore Jazz besides EDM. This new genre, which is considerably more complex than most modern music, will be explored in a rather unusual way, as the developer has injected a Malaysian flair into it, which is sure to make the experience rather unique. The addition of a more complex genre will also impact gameplay in some form, Wan Hazmer told me, although it was difficult to tell exactly how from the short demo playthrough I watched during the session. One thing this playthrough made sure of is how boss fights will once again be the highlight of the experience. The one featured in the demo did an excellent job showing how the gameplay complexity has increased, with mobs joining in the fight, and the music's intensity indicating when the boss is about to unleash a powerful attack. With some new cues indicating when an attack can be parried, perfect dodging, a stun mechanic that allows players to stun enemies if certain conditions are met, a combat arena that changes depending on how the battle is going, taking advantage of a green screen setup in a very clever way to offer some visual storytelling, it's clear how No Straight Roads 2 is setting out to be a more involving experience than its predecessor that will surprise the vast majority of players.</p>



<p>With Hi-Fi Rush in some way revolutionizing the action-rhythm game landscape, I expected No Straight Roads 2 to take more than a few pages from its book, but that is not precisely what Metronomik is doing with their game. While it is undeniable that Tango Gameworks' action title has influenced the game, Metronomik is focused on keeping its identity, using music differently and far less restrictively. Unlike Hi-Fi Rush, where the player is punished for doing things to the beat, No Straight Roads 2 provides incentives for doing so but with no downside if the player doesn't. This is not only a way to make the game more accessible and less restrictive, but also to implement more varied music. In Hi-Fi Rush, every song is rhytmically simple in a 4/4 beat, which makes it easy for players to follow even if they have no music education. With No Straight Roads 2 exploring different musical genres, this wouldn't have worked as well and would have proved to be even more restrictive and punishing. In terms of music, No Straight Roads 2 will also feature all original music, so licensing issues will not force the developer to alter their game down the line.</p>



<p>With so many improvements across the board, including multiplayer, No Straight Roads 2 is setting out to be a much better game than its predecessor. The little I have seen of the game being so interesting already, I cannot wait to see what else Metronomik has come up with, especially how the new bosses will top the already excellent bosses of the original and how the yet-to-be-revealed character will impact an experience that already looks to be tons of fun. Unfortunately, the wait may still be a little long, as No Straight Roads 2 is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC and yet-to-be-confirmed consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A UK-based video game reseller claims Sega was behind a police raid that seized a trove of Nintendo development kits from his home, according <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/09/sega-accused-of-using-police-to-recover-nintendo-dev-kits-it-had-negligently-disposed-of">to a report from <em>Time Extension</em></a>. The seller, who reportedly purchased the collection from a scrapyard, accuses Sega of getting the police involved to recover the dev kits after mistakenly throwing them out.</p><p>The seller tells the outlet that he purchased the rare finds for around £10,000 (~$13,526) from a worker who showed up at the scrapyard with “a van-load of items that had reportedly come from Sega’s office clearance.” Sega <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/after-more-than-20-years-sonic-will-no-longer-overlook-one-of-the-uks-busiest-roads">moved its Europe office</a> from Brentford, West London, to the city’s Chiswick Business Park earlier this year.</p><p>On July 14th — around three months after the purchase — police arrested the seller and raided his home, according to <em>Time Extension</em>. “I was woken at around 7:30 am by a loud knock at my door,” the seller tells <em>Time Extension</em>. “When I opened it, I was met by approximately ten officers from the City of London Police. They informed me that I was under arrest for money laundering and that they were there to seize development kits and game cartridges.”</p><p>In addition to Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DSi, 2DS, 3DS, Wii, and Wii U dev kits, the collection also included a bunch of prototype games, including <em>Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</em>, <em>Sonic Generations</em>, <em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Winter Olympic Games</em>, <em>Phantasy Star 0</em>, and many others. It’s unclear whether the games were seized by police.</p><p>Just days after releasing the seller, police reportedly asked him to sign a “formal disclaimer request” that asks him to relinquish ownership of the dev kits, indicating that he fairly obtained the consoles. The seller hasn’t heard back from the police after refusing to sign the disclaimer, nor has Sega reached out to him despite being “named in six separate pre-action protocol claims,” he tells <em>Time Extension</em>.</p><p>The rare consoles are still in the hands of the police, and it’s unclear whether they’ll ever see the light of day, <a href="https://x.com/VGPMuseum/status/1965390297900126545">sparking frustration</a> from the video game preservation community. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Sega with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776260/sega-police-raid-nintendo-dev-kits#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776260/sega-police-raid-nintendo-dev-kits]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordvpn-is-free-for-20-months-but-heres-the-condition-you-need-to-meet-2000624896</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nordvpn-is-free-for-20-months-but-here%E2%80%99s-the-condition-you-need-to-meet.1294650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people don’t realize how exposed they are when browsing online until something goes wrong. The truth is, <strong>every click, search, and connection leaves a trace that can be tracked or exploited</strong>. That’s why so many users turn to VPNs (<em>Virtual Private Networks</em>) to protect their digital lives.</p>
<p>And right now, NordVPN (the world’s leading VPN) has an incredible offer that feels like getting nearly two years of service for free: Thanks to a 73% discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">it’s as if you only pay for 7 months at the regular rate and get 20 months free</a>. Spread across the entire 27-month duration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">that works out to just $3.09 a month</a> instead of the usual $11.59. In practical terms, you’re<strong> locking down your online safety for pennies a day</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<h2>Why a VPN Matters More Than Ever</h2>
<p>Think of a VPN as your <strong>own personal shield when you’re on the internet</strong>: Instead of leaving your browsing open to hackers, advertisers or your internet provider, NordVPN protects your data with military-grade encryption (check out Gizmodo’s full review <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn">here</a>). That means no one can peep into your history or watch over your online activities.</p>
<p>NordVPN is especially trustworthy because of its <strong>no-logs policy.</strong> Other providers log your activity, while NordVPN does not record your browsing history at all. And if you want even more protection, its Double VPN mode sends your connection through two different servers and double the encryption but still with your speed kept surprisingly fast.</p>
<p>Aside from simple browsing privacy, <strong>a VPN unlocks doors you might not have considered</strong>: Ever been stuck mid-stream because the show you wanted to watch was geo-restricted where you are? With NordVPN, you can stream off one of its 7,000+ servers in more than 120 locations across the globe, which makes geo-blocked content accessible and video streaming sharp.</p>
<p>Another reassuring touch: speed. Some VPNs are notorious for slowing down your speed, but NordVPN is built to remain fast. Its huge server network means you’ll always be able to get one close by so streaming HD content or video calling remains smooth.</p>
<p>NordVPN doesn’t end at VPN fundamentals either: The Plus plan, currently reduced to about $3.99 monthly also features improvements like Threat Protection Pro. It operates close to antivirus, eliminating malware, irritating ads and trackers that bog down your system otherwise. Aside from this, you are given NordPass, a built-in password manager that protects your logins and puts them under control behind strong encryption.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about how many devices can be covered, NordVPN makes it simple: <strong>you can protect up to 10 devices simultaneously</strong> on a single account.</p>
<p>Best of all, NordVPN comes with a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. That means you can try it without risk, and if you don’t believe so, you simply get your money back. Ultimately, the numbers make this deal impossible to refuse: You pay 7 months at the standard rate, and NordVPN adds 20 extra months on top, for free.</p>

This is quick and easy to do, and you can then activate your Shift codes on the same website or via the in-game Social menu or via Borderland 4's Social menu at launch.

			<p>Sometimes you can tell how a game will play at a first glance, with the huge explosion of Hades clones generally easy to recognise. I went into my first experience with Hell Clock fully expecting a take on Supergiant’s classic but what I found was actually something far more original and interesting, albeit not without some issues and flaws. While it shares the general rogue-like approach of Zagreus’ adventures, the actual gameplay is far more in keeping with classic Diablo, and scratched a nostalgic itch I didn’t realise I had.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Clock | Launch Trailer | Play Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EXoQ_s6ppw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of the game is its real historical backdrop, taking place 8 years after Brazil’s War of Canudos, a tragic event in which tens of thousands of refugees were slaughtered by the new Brazilian Republic in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This is a historical event about which I was totally unaware before coming across this game and it shows how well games can educate alongside entertain. This is exactly the kind of experience that my erstwhile colleagues are looking at in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/playing-with-history-now-live-on-kickstarter/">‘Playing With History’ book</a> and I’ll be recommending they take a gander at Hell Clock.</p>


<p>This real world context doesn’t mean that the game is hyper realistic, however. Indeed, such is the depth of historical trauma surrounding the War of Canudos that the game’s dark fantasy aesthetic feels like a metaphorical attempt to come to terms with those memories. This is most obviously seen through the monstrous bosses that represent major figures in the invading army. These are truly grotesque and prove extremely challenging until you’ve refined your build.</p>


<p>While the general tone of Hellclock is dark the graphics benefit from an excellent balance of light and shade. A cel-shaded comic book effect helps enemies and backgrounds to stand out and there is a decent range of environments across the various stages – although the layouts themselves tend to repeat relatively quickly. Depending on your choice of skills and powers there can be a vast amount of visual effects on display soon and this can be both a blessing and a curse. Fully powered up attacks look incredible but can bring the framerate crashing down – particularly in the last main area of the game.</p>
<p>Performance as a whole here was decent until that last area (one that I won’t spoil here) where the solid 75fps gradually dropped until it fell off a cliff. The one time I beat the final boss was a battle of attrition with 5fps and took fully 35-40 minutes whilst watching a YouTube video. This is not what the game is intended to play as though and says a lot about my general stubbornness and desire to see the ending for this review.</p>

<p>In fact, the main loop of Hellclock is all about speed and min-maxing your builds. The standard mechanics include the titular Hellclock which constantly counts down towards your death – only pausing during boss battles. At first you have a measly 7 minutes but there are upgrades to unlock that increase this and bosses also drop extra time pick-ups when defeated. This mechanic ensures that every run is a test of your dps rather than skill which clearly appeals to the Path of Exile and Diablo players but is a far cry from the Hades style I was expecting.</p>
<p>There is an option to disable the clock and play the game in a more strategic way but after completing the game this way I would advise against it. While this mode does prevent the constant time pressure it ends up becoming a war of extreme attrition and the resultant drawn-out kiting of damage-sponge enemies can quickly sap your enjoyment. I would go so far as to suggest that the devs should probably remove this option and stick to their preferred approach.</p>

<p>Playing as a resurrected victim of the massacre, you’re armed with a revolver that serves as your primary weapon. I was a little disappointed that there are no alternatives here (rifles, shotguns, or sabres could have mixed things up build-wise) but you can level it up and apply buffs through equipped relics to increase your damage. Basic shots are free but all other attacks require mana to activate so there is a balance to be drawn between attacking and allowing your mana to recharge. The real build strategy comes in choosing from a wide range of spells to add to your arsenal.</p>
<p>These skills range from support effects such as dash and shield to more offensive abilities such as rapid fire and high damage explosives and all are well designed to fit in with the general aesthetic. Each set of skills is unlocked as you progress through the game’s acts but some of the early skills remain useful right up to the end. I found a combination of magical crosses that surrounded my character and life steal from equipped relics was overpowered as it meant I survived far longer than my damage output should have allowed but I think this has been balanced in part through patches (and of course would not have helped with the Hellclock in play).</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hellclock is a solid game that offers something new to both the roguelike and Diablo genres but may not have the wider appeal of titles such as Hades due to its focus on min-maxing and DPS over skill. The confused approach of offering game modes that actively undermine the title’s central gameplay mechanic, and the current performance issues in the latter stages, are real negatives but the first can be avoided and the second is being worked on. If the idea of a roguelike Path of Exile appeals, then Hellclock may well be the game for you.	</p></div>

            <p>CD Projekt have rolled out a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch with fixes and tweaks for some of update 2.3's additions. The most noteworthy is what sounds like a pretty hefty revamp of how the autodrive function goes about conveying your ride from A to B.</p>
<p>If you missed it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">arriving back in July</a>, update 2.3 was the final set of new stuff CD Projekt plan to add to the first Cyberpunk, a game they've been physically unable to stop themselves from delving back into over the past couple of years, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Cyberpunk 2 having been in the works for a little while now</a>. To be fair, most of its contents were vehicle and photo mode-related, with the autodrive function and similar Delamain taxi system heaflining alongside some new rides.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you might guess from this <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">patch 2.31's notes</a>, autodrive's a feature that's come with a few kinks for anyone who's tried it. I've been able to rely pretty well on it to get me where I want to go in the on-and-off Cyberpunk playthrough I've had going for about a month now, but it has suffered from constantly jamming the brakes on in a very jarring fashion, as well as occasionally getting stuck or rear ending some poor fellow in a tiny Makigai MaiMai.</p>
<p>The devs have clearly been at work on those hangups, writing that as of this patch: "When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably." Sounds great, assuming other traffic have been se to automatically give way at junctions, otherwise there'll be a rise in Kiroshi dashcam footage of Thortons being t-boned in the near future.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Patch 2.31 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Mac and Nintendo Switch 2!</p><p>This update includes an AutoDrive upgrade and Photo Mode adjustments. It also addresses common issues encountered by players. For details, check the full list of… <a href="https://t.co/Jdpx1DI4V5">pic.twitter.com/Jdpx1DI4V5</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1966081108199809196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Aside from that, there are some fixes for the quests surrounding update 2.3 vehicles like the Semimaru and Muramasa, as well as on that saw Johnny Silverhand always spawn in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cabs. He's always been in back for me, so I must have gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Moving to photo mode, CD Projekt have made "most" of the character poses added update 2.3 work with folks of any gender and disabled NPC collision in the mode. That collision removal's in an effort to "make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision", such as perching Rogue or Kerry on the bonnet of your car.</p>
<p>The last couple of bits I'll highlight are PC-specific fixes. One's for "an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink", which is an equally hilarious and horrifying hardware happening. The second's for path tracing not activating properly in "certain scenarios".</p>
<p>Obviously, patches are the enemy of load orders, so it's worth checking or waiting for mod updates if you don't fancy disabling the likes of this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies">story-driven rent system</a> if you've got them installed. Don't want the landlord selfies being borked next time you chip in, you know?</p>

                  Amazon is clearing out AirPods Pro 2 after the new model launch.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s grand keynote happened only two days ago, and though <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-blur-the-line-between-health-wearable-and-wireless-earbuds-2000655557">the AirPods Pro 3 were the highlight</a>, Amazon had a different idea: clear out the remaining AirPods Pro 2 at an unbeatable price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">they’re down to $199 instead of the usual $249, and that’s as low as it gets for one of Apple’s most popular earbuds</a>. Amazon wants to move the last of its stock, and if you don’t care about extras like heart rate monitoring or calorie tracking, the AirPods Pro 2 are more than enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>



<h2>Advanced ANC Earbuds</h2>
<p>The reason the drop is so tempting is that <strong>these earbuds remain some of the most advanced true wireless earphones</strong> Apple has ever produced. They pack the H2 chip which powers improved sound quality and smarter noise cancellation. Active noise cancellation works to block out the hum of traffic, chatter on your commute, or background noise in the office, and Transparency Mode lets the world back in whenever you need to stay aware. On top of that, Personalized Spatial Audio adapts sound to the shape of your ears for a immersive surround-like feel.</p>



<p>The earbuds’ sound profile is accurate and detailed, with bright, even balance between highs, mids, and bass. If you’re looking for audio quality without the bulk of over-ear headphones, this remains one of the best everyday choices.</p>
<p>Apple overhauled the fit to be more comfortable with several ear tip sizes in the box that help create a snug seal. That makes it more effective at noise reduction and reduces ear fatigue during extended listening sessions. Battery life is more than adequate for daily use, <strong>with up to six hours of continuous use on one charge and 30 hours total if you count the charging case</strong>. The case itself charges through USB-C now, so you can charge it with the same cord you’re using for a MacBook or iPad.</p>
<p>There’s the convenience factor, too: <strong>Pairing with iPhone, iPad, and Mac is virtually instantaneous</strong> and technologies like automatic switching mean you’ll remain connected without further tapping or change-of-setting crap. If you’re engaged in a FaceTime call on your MacBook and then get up to answer a call on your phone, the AirPods Pro 2 switch just along with you.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see Amazon cut the price this aggressively on a flagship Apple product. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab a pair, this is pretty much it. At $199 instead of $249, the AirPods Pro 2 bring high-end Apple features to your daily routine without asking you to overspend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Dual Wield Joy-Con Charging Dock For Switch 2 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b2b8b2977436/review-genki-dual-wield-joy-con-charging-dock-for-switch-2-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Genki — which recently made headlines by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">settling a lawsuit with Nintendo</a> after it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">showcased 3D-printed mockups of the Switch 2 during CES 2025</a> — has supported the arrival of the new hybrid console with a selection of accessories and cases. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/joy-station">Dual Wield ($39.99)</a> follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo">Force Field 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Sleeper Case</a>, and offers a means of charging four Joy-Con 2 controllers at once.</p>
<p>This isn't a new or groundbreaking concept, of course; we saw similar controller charging docks during the original Switch's lifespan. These products certainly have their uses, especially if you have one Switch 2 console but multiple Joy-Con for local multiplayer sessions, but is this worth the $40 asking price?</p>

<p>The Dual Wield certainly ticks all of the boxes when it comes to basic functionality. It consists of the charging dock (which is powered by a USB-A to USB-C cable, included in the bundle) and a pair of 'Delta' Joy-Con controller grips. These can charge your Joy-Con in two ways: there's a USB-C port on the top and a charging port on the bottom, which magnetically interfaces with the dock.</p>
<p>When charging on the dock, you'll see a pair of red LEDs light up for each Joy-Con – these turn to green once each Joy-Con is at full capacity. To eject the Delta grip, you press the button in front.</p>
<p>So far, so good, right? Sadly, the Delta grips themselves leave a little to be desired. It's not that they're uncomfortable to use – in fact, I'd go as far as to say they offer decent ergonomics when it comes to long play sessions. The bigger issue is that there's a lot of 'flex' on each Joy-Con, and it's actually possible to pull them off the grip without too much effort.</p>

<p>While a good, hard yank will also dislodge the Joy-Con from the official grip, it's much easier with Genki's offering. Nintendo's grips also avoid the 'flex' issue by including built-in prongs, which are what your hands grip during play. With the Genki Delta grip, you're mostly holding onto the Joy-Con themselves rather than the grip, hence the worrying amount of movement.</p>
<p>I also don't like how hard it is to see the Joy-Con's LED lights through the dark, transparent casing of the Delta grip. The light is dim, and it's sometimes hard to make out if the Joy-Con are switched on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Genki Dual Wield isn't a total miss; the Delta grips are comfortable to use, and the dock itself looks attractive enough to integrate into most AV setups. My biggest gripe is how unstable the Joy-Con feel when they're attached to that Delta; Nintendo's official grip is far superior.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> Relaxed Mode mod is now available for download, featuring plenty of QOL improvements that can make the game more enjoyable for those struggling with some of its elements, such as the high challenge level.</p>



<p>The mod, which has been developed by didrio and can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/92?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, features a selection of balance and quality-of-life enhancements that can be fully configured, allowing users to only use some of the features the mod offers. Among these are balance changes with all damage reduced to 1 mask, Rosary Beads and Shards multipliers, healing changes, Swift Step and Clawline no longer consuming silk, health bars for enemies and bosses, increased iframes after receiving damage, and more. Although some of these changes undoubtedly make Hollow Knight: Silksong a little easier, the vast majority of them make for a more enjoyable experience, especially for those who never played the first entry in the series and were unprepared for the high level of challenge the new game shows right from the beginning.</p>



<p>Team Cherry seems to be aware that Hollow Knight: Silksong presents a high challenge level right from the beginning, and has confirmed that some balance changes will be included in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-team-cherry-first-patch-makes-early-game-easier/">first patch</a>. Specifically, the patch will reduce the difficulty of early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter, reduce damage from Sandcarvers, reduce mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices and more. Personally, I didn't find the two bosses mentioned by Team Cherry to be particularly challenging, but I can definitely see how they can be difficult to take down for players who aren't used to the sort of balancing that's more common in Soulslike games, rather than Metroidvania titles.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

To celebrate the highly-anticipated launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> this Friday (12th September), 2K are unleashing a huge takeover of the capital's transport hub across the weekend, with game imagery, interactive elements and a tonne of loot flooding the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your approach, look out for a number of billboards between the BFI IMAX and the station, featuring spoof fragrance ads and a Ripper bursting through the glass on the side of the railway bridge. As well as 3D chains and shards, this poster lights up, with the character's eyes glowing throughout the night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the main concourse, the massive digital screens will feature character art and the game's "break free" messaging, while cosplayers decked out in Vault Hunter gear roam amongst the crowds, interacting with passers by. Head down to get your hands on your very own Ripper mask and a share of the free Borderlands 4 merch on offer, including hoodies, t-shirts, caps, Claptrap totes, lanyards and keyrings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/10/roadside-special-build-1757492892927.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3D Borderlands 4 billboard outside London Waterloo station</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also set to be two Snapchat experiences live across both Friday and Saturday. Activate an AR lens to transform head to toe into a Ripper, and try your luck with an interactive vending machine, which will be spitting out prizes for those who score enough points in its integrated Borderlands 4 mini-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The domination will continue at the tube line level, with wanted posters and wraps spouting "Keep Order" propaganda on behalf of the game's villain, The Timekeeper. Resistance will of course peek through, with signature Borderlands-style graffiti and artwork plastered across the walls and ticket barriers, showing rebellious Rippers breaking free from their shackles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kairos influence extends down the escalators, with The Timekeeper watching over the summit, and Synths following passengers down on the digital screens. Even the travelator linking the Bakerloo, Jubilee and Northern lines has a Borderlands flourish, courtesy of Claptrap himself.

Be sure to keep an eye out for other underground ads which may have been given the Borderlands 4 treatment…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full Borderlands 4 takeover experience will be live at Waterloo Station throughout September 12-13.

It looks like Sonic and Shadow are heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, though perhaps not in the way you'd expect.
</p>
<p>
Known Fortnite leaker Wenso has shared datamined evidence on social media of Kicks themed around the two Sega hedgehogs based on in-game data, suggesting in-game trainers will be added to the game. 
</p>
<p>
The designs resemble <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">Puma's forthcoming Sonic the Hedgehog collection</a>, which will be available to purchase from 30th October - perhaps that's when they'll be added to Fortnite too, though Wenso noted there are no shop assets yet.

<p>
The Fortnite shop already includes <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?game=br&amp;type=kicks">Kicks</a> for brands like Nike, Adidas, Vans, and Puma.
</p>
<p>
Puma's collection also includes sneakers themed on sidekick Tails, though these are yet to be discovered in the game.

<p>
Does this mean we'll also get full skins to play as? That does seem unlikely, in part due to character proportions but also that Sonic canonically has not wielded a gun - although Shadow, of course, has.
</p>
<p>
Still, I think Sega is likely to go the way of Nintendo and not want its characters shooting each other. Perhaps we could see more clothing items in addition to those Kicks?
</p>
<p>The Fortnite crossover could also coincide with the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, due out later this month. Indeed, the racing game's premise is crossovers with other series, so perhaps it works both ways.</p>

<p>And an old foe returns in a timed in-game event</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DxM gyro and live event" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4892c75f309f/dxm-gyro-and-live-event.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Marvellous</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> has been out in the wild for around about a week now and, if you checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">our 6/10 review</a> of the game, you'll know that gyro controls were missing from action at launch. Boo!</p>
<p>Now, producer Kenichiro Tsukuda, <a href="https://x.com/dxm_game/status/1965228970770596351">via the game's official social media account</a>, has dropped some details on an upcoming patch that will sort our gyro woes, alongside a bunch of other fixes. Here's the post, plus the accompanying text detailing the upcoming patch notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planned Bug Fixes<br>
- Fix Rebellion’s behavior in the Teos Omos Desert.<br>
- Fix a bug where a violation of the End User License Agreement was incorrectly displayed when a network error occurred.<br>
- Fix for character models failing to load during event scenes.<br>
- Fix for Supply Bases becoming inaccessible.<br>
- Fix a bug where battle music fails to stop playing.<br>
- Fix other minor bugs.</p>
<p>Planned Additions and Adjustments<br>
- Added option to enable gyro controls for Nintendo Switch™ 2 and PlayStation®5.<br>
- Added options to adjust strength of camera acceleration and inertia.<br>
- Changed camera sensitivity settings to be separately adjustable for vertical and horizontal axes.<br>
- Changed early-game quest “The Bout With Ash” to allow players to pick up weapons inside the arena.<br>
- Improved loading times during online play.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no date on when exactly this patch will drop, but we're excited to see gyro-aiming get sorted so quickly. The other standouts are reduced loading times and camera improvements, which could make for a less stodgy feel to proceedings as we all keep our big metal fingers crossed for more meaningful performance gains and upgrades down the road.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, while awaiting the patch, you can also brush up on your mech-fighting skills against an old foe, as one of the original game's toughest boss battles has returned as a timed event that's running from right now until September 15th.</p>
<p>Yep, if you're a long-time fan, you'll need no introduction to Zeruchroar, who is back and looking for a scrap (cheers for the heads-up, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/11/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-brings-back-old-boss-for-a-new-event/">Forbes</a>). Now this was quite a nasty battle back on the first game, so luckily, if you are intending to try it, know that there is at least a reward in the form of some new blueprints and a "glitched fusion upgrade" should you best the rotten beast. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Oh, and just head to your base in-game to get an alert to start the timed event.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing features such as AutoDrive upgrades, Photo Mode adjustments, fixes, and improvements.</p>



<p>The 2.31 patch, which went live earlier today, updates AutoDrive so that the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtaking blocking vehicles and no longer stopping at traffic lights when driving to a selected point of the map. Free Roam mode has also been improved to follow traffic rules and navigate Night City more reliably. The patch also introduced some Photo Mode adjustments, as mentioned above, making most of the new poses introduced in the previous update work with any gender, disabling NPC collisions, and more.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 patch also brings a slew of quests and open world fixes, localization issues, adds a toggle to disable vignette, and addresses some PC and Mac specific issues, such as an issue were NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled and an issue where path tracing didn't activate properly in certain scenarios, ray-traced reflections not displaying correctly under certain conditions, stability and performance improvements and more. You can learn more about everything the 2.31 patch brings to the game in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/503961862016073928?l=english">official patch notes.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn more about the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion and the 2.0 update, which massively overhauled most of the gameplay systems, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/road-kings-gamescom-2025-q-a-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98you-are-the-hero-of-the-open-road%E2%80%99.1294524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment revealed Road Kings, the latest chapter in their successful series of racing simulation games after MudRunner, SnowRunner, Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, and Roadcraft.</p>



<p>Whereas most of the previous games focused on off-road driving, though, this one is squarely aimed at delivering the definitive trucking experience. Players will start out as rookie drivers behind the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South, from Jacksonville to Savannah. They will have to keep an eye on everything that real truck drivers do, from regulations to fuel, unpredictable weather, and much more. There's even going to be a narrative component that ties everything together, exposing the human element to the drivers and everyone involved in trucking.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to chat with Saber Interactive Porto Game Director Peter Mack and Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits about Road Kings, which is scheduled to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141130/Road_Kings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X consoles (a Nintendo Switch 2 port is still under evaluation).</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Peter, which game did you work on before this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This is the first project I've worked on at Saber Porto. My experience before this was working with smaller LEGO games at another company, but I've now been with Saber Porto for many years.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so this is the first project you've been doing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> With Saber Porto, yes.</p>



<p><strong>How long have you been working on this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This project started production around three years ago and was in pre-production for a year before that.</p>



<p><strong>Does this run on your proprietary engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> No, it's Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using any of the signature features, such as Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes, we're taking advantage of a lot of features that are now available.</p>



<p><strong>I don't know if you can share that, but is Road Kings also coming to the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I would have to get back to you on that.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> We haven't quite decided that. Yeah, we're investigating it, but we're looking at our pipeline and stuff. One of the things to add to his answer about technology is that yes, it runs on Unreal, but we are leveraging the knowledge and experience that Saber has developed with Snowrunner, road crab, Mudrunner, you know, and any fantastic. We know vehicles. We know big vehicles, and we know trucks. You can really feel that it's solid, real, when driving. We have been praised for our realistic simulations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Saber has done many racing simulation projects about trucks and stuff like that. Where does Road Kings sit in this portfolio?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I feel this is a spiritual successor to all of the simulation-centered titles that have come before it. It's inspired by them and it makes a very nice complement to Saber's other racing simulations.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Yep. Right in the middle! We are very proud of it. We've added that Saber spirit to it, where you are the hero of the open road. It is a true truck simulator, but you do so much more. You help people in need, you help communities in need...</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> It's very human.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> It's about trucks. At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</p>



<p><strong>You said there is a story in Road Kings. Can you talk a bit about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. As I was just saying, trucks are a huge part of society, so they are involved in a lot of very important things to a lot of people. We tried to create a story that touches on these facts and what we've learned by talking with truck drivers and understanding their lives. We tried to create a narrative that the player, as part of an immersive simulation, can engage with or not. If you like to just sort of work and drive for long-haul trips over the road, you can, but if you want to engage with a sort of narrative experience, you can do that, too.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Especially in America, where trucking is very important. The country is really big, and we don't have trains like in Europe, so the trucking culture in America is very unique. Tapping on what Peter said about that spirit and human factor, that is really important.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There are also all the changes that are happening in the industry right now. When we were doing research for Road Kings, we were reading about and speaking with people about their fears about the impact technology has on trucking. If you look at blogs lately, it's about autonomous trucks and when they are coming and what they are going to do to this very important aspect of society that has existed in the United States for hundreds of years, and how it's going to be affected. Along with that, there's the change in the technology of the trucks. There is a change going on in the climate and the increasingly unpredictable weather, which often affects drivers and puts them in danger. All these things are for us narrative components to bring into stories you encounter in the game..</p>



<p><strong>Can you share how long the story of Road Kings is going to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I understand it's topping out at about 10 hours of gaming, but that's pretty much if you sail right through and if you do story beat after story beat.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> I mean, it's a simulation game. You can play forever beyond the story.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There is also a layer of procedurally generated conditions and stories that you can encounter. For example, the dispatcher can call you up. Again, taken right from the pages of drivers, blogs, and diaries, they call you up and tell you that they made a mistake and the job you're doing is wrong, and can you do them a favour and take it to the other side of the state? And if you say yes, if it's convenient and makes sense, you get a reputation with the dispatcher, and if you say no, you get paid as normal. So, in addition to it being endless in terms of the simulation, there's even the sort of endless aspect to the small stories you can encounter.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The weather is dynamic, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Does it include icy conditions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Let us get up toward Missouri and we can talk about that, but right now you're in sort of north Florida to southern Georgia. So, we don't have snowstorms for now, but we're looking at it.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk about the asynchronous multiplayer mode?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a leaderboard for the player-created companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Is it cross-platform? Can you invite a friend who plays the game on another platform?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Indeed!</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support Road Kings post-launch, with more content and features?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Absolutely. 100%. We already have a lot of content planned for after launch. We find that this game lends itself very easily and naturally to expansion, not just in terms of geography, but in terms of truck types and customizations. All is expandable post-launch, but we also see very easily that we can add more stories and more narratives and more dispatchers, and more companies. I think we have fifteen more companies already lined up to be considered.</p>



<p><strong>Would these be premium DLCs, or possibly some free DLCs, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I think we're looking at a plan that includes all of the above.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you both for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Watch out! EA claim to have created "the most dangerous ring in gaming" for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale, and they won't stop waving their lethal hoop around in a post that runs down the mode's features ahead of its first Labs playtest.</p>
<p>Prior to now, all we've gotten battle royale-wise have been teases, with the devs busy seeking feedback on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s more standard multiplayer bits during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">recent open beta</a>. Oh, and showing off their campaign's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">rampant helicopter destruction</a>, lest we forget the great sacrifice of those poor metal birds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In that <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing">blog post</a>, EA insist their battle royale'll still be plenty Battlefieldy, since it doesn't ditch the gadgets, explosives, environmental destruction, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/better-for-battlefield-6-vehicles-to-start-off-too-weak-says-producer-to-players-sore-about-tooled-up-engineers">vehicles</a> you usually have at your disposal in field battles. There'll be 100 players crammed into a specially built new map, armed with "two default gadgets" their chosen class to kick off the hunting for loot and experience points. Oh, and obviously the killing, can't forget about that.</p>
<p>Enveloping this gaggle is the usual battle royale contracting boundary, but EA claim to not have settled for any old harmful circle, as they outline below:</p>
<blockquote>We set out to bring the most dangerous ring in gaming to Battle Royale that instantly kills players upon contact. With urgent warnings as the fire approaches, soldiers will be pushed into more intense firefights as the game space continues to shrink. There’s no jumping in and out of it, no using it for cover, no walking through it - if you get caught in it, you are done. We’re excited to see how the ring affects the pace of the game and how it creates spontaneous showdowns.</blockquote>
<p>Jiminy crickets, a brim of bad times so deadly you've got to describe it like an obstacle from the classic children's tale We're Going on a Bear Hunt. I like the idea of instant murder over a countdown or gradual damage in theory, though that'll probably go out of the window the moment I'm a bit too slow to migrate towards the middle of the map melee.</p><p>Another detail worth noting is the makeup of the goodies players'll be able to grab during these fights. "There are five tiers of weapons to loot along with attachments, throwables (Ex. Frag Grenades), gadgets (Ex. RPGs), Strike Packages (Ex. Air Strike), armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorited weapons," EA outline. The mode also packs support class revives and "mobile redeploy options" that can bring you back if you snuff it because you've been blasted into oblivion while trying to snag your most beloved of bullet-dealers.</p>
<p>The battle royale testing is set to begin at some point this week, and you can sign-up to be given access <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">here</a> if this'll be your first jaunt into Labs ahead of Battlefield 6's release on October 10th.</p>
