<p>The game was released last Friday, 28th February, and on its first day reached a concurrent player count on Steam of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">over a million within its first day</a>.

<p>Capcom has put the high sales down to the game's broad global appeal, its inclusion in global events (like PlayStation's State of Play and The Game Awards), and holding multiple online beta tests.</p>
<p>"Capcom remains firmly committed to satisfying the expectations of all users by leveraging its industry leading game development capabilities in order to create highly entertaining gameplay experiences," the company said, perhaps alluding to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor technical performance of the game</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-warns-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-update-will-discontinue-your-online-session">patch for the game was released earlier this morning</a>, designed to fix a progress-blocking bug and more.</p>
<p>Capcom lists its top-selling games, what it calls <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles</a>, with Monster Hunter Worlds at the top with 21.3m units sold (as of December last year). It's followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> with 16.7m and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake with 15m.</p>
<p>Could Monster Hunter Wilds overthrow its predecessor? At the very least, it's cemented once again that Monster Hunter is Capcom's most lucrative series.</p>
<p>If you're just starting out on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-monster-hunter-wilds-mod-bypasses-capcoms-monetised-character-edits">mods have already been released by fans</a> to bypass character creator monetisation and tweak various settings.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this morning that Monster Hunter Wilds has already set new record sales. In the first three days since launch, the game sold over eight million units, becoming the fastest game to do so in the Japanese publisher's 45-year history.</p>
<p>This record-breaking milestone is not at all unexpected, given the immense hype surrounding the game after the highly successful entries Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. Moreover, this past weekend, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a user concurrency peak of 1.38 million on Steam, stepping into the platform's all-time top five for this chart.</p>
<p>Of course, user reviews are still quite low at 58%, mostly due to the game's performance on PC. For now, CAPCOM hasn't said if they will improve the game's technical side, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are a few mods that might help</a>. Overall, though, this is a great game if you're into this type of experience, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM has also promoted franchise producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, likely as a result of the series' excellent sales results. Starting on April 1, he'll replace Yoichi Egawa as the publisher's executive corporate officer and chief product officer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Warzone surfaced in 2020 as a free-to-play battle royale of epic proportions. Within just a few days, it had secured tens of millions of players worldwide, and it became known as one of the best games in the genre. Unfortunately, the game didn’t stand up well to the test of time, and after a couple of years, too many bad decisions were made, and players started rapidly abandoning the title.</p>



<p>Given that times have changed and players are still moving on, is Warzone being shut down? Activision won’t support a ‘dying game’ forever, but is Warzone going to be discontinued?</p>



<p>Join me as we find out the answer to that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-dying">Is Warzone Dying?</h2>



<p>In 2025, a prominent Call of Duty leaker revealed that the revival of Verdansk – due to take place in April 2025 – is the last-ditch effort for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">Activision to bring players back to Warzone</a>.</p>



<p>It was mentioned that if Verdansk isn’t a success and players aren’t retained, then <strong>Warzone will be shut down before Call of Duty 2026 arrives</strong>.</p>



<p>This comes as Warzone struggles under the weight of network issues, a plague of cheaters, and lacklustre updates that haven’t given the community a sense of hope for the future of the iconic battle royale.</p>



<p>The esports scene for Warzone is wavering; streamers are abandoning the game for other battle royales, and players worldwide are losing faith in the platform at large.</p>



<p>When you ask if Warzone is dying, you can just look at the streaming figures for the game:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: TwitchTracker.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warzone’s performance on streaming platforms like Twitch is at an all-time low. The peaks we’re seeing now are lower than ever before, which is a telling indicator that the game is dying.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-being-discontinued">Is Warzone Being Discontinued?</h2>



<p>Presently, Warzone isn’t being discontinued, but there’s a very real possibility that it will be within the next year or so.</p>



<p>If the leaks are to be believed, Verdansk is the last shot developers have at making Call of Duty: Warzone an ongoing success. It’s an attempt to revive the player base and bring millions of users back onto the platform. If it fails, Warzone could be shut down by the end of 2026.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been said if Warzone Mobile will be shut down, though. This speculation is in reference to the ‘main’ version of Warzone on console and PC.</p>



<p>What will you do if Warzone is shut down? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya Still Wants To Develop Scalebound with Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-develop-scalebound-with-xbox.1124466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent post on social media, Hideki Kamiya, who founded CLOVERS Inc. after leaving PlatinumGames in 2023, revealed that he’d still love to make Scalebound. The ill-fated RPG was cancelled in 2017 after years of discussions and rumours, but it seems that the Japanese gaming legend hasn’t forgotten about it – to the point that he still wants to make it.</p>



<p>Scalebound was in development at PlatinumGames for around four years before it was ultimately cancelled, and Kamiya was the game’s director. This isn’t the first time that the industry icon has pleaded for Xbox to pick the project up again, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shot-down">Shot Down</h2>



<p>PlatinumGames is famous for the creation of titles like Niear and Bayonetta, but Scalebound would have been a more ambitious game on a different level entirely. In Scalebound, players would have explored a world populated by dragons – and dragonriders. It was announced in 2014 with a trailer dropping at E3 (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/e3-is-officially-over/">has since died a death</a>), and prospective fans were excited.</p>



<p>The year before Scalebound was revealed, Microsoft penned a deal with Platinum, assuming control of Scalebound in exchange for pumping cash into the coffers to build it. It was shaped around a third-person action-RPG model, and it looked good enough on the surface, but it was ultimately cancelled by Microsoft in 2017.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SCALEBOUND Gameplay Trailer (E3 2016)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dgxcs_5cztw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It was cited that the game’s stoppage was caused by issues with the Unreal Engine, ‘an inability to live up to player expectations’, and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the game’s core elements.</p>



<p>But along came Hideki Kamiya, almost a decade after that cancellation, saying he still wants to make Scalebound:</p>











<p>His cry of ‘Let’s do it, Phil!’ came following a post from CLOVERS Inc. on Twitter. This post revealed that the team at CLOVERS was banded around Kamiya’s desk, reminiscing about Scalebound while watching videos of the game on YouTube. In the snippet, he said, ‘I’d love to make it again someday.’</p>



<p>In 2023, it was suggested in a discussion on a podcast that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scalebound-revival/">a revival of Scalebound</a> <strong>could </strong>be on the way, but we’ve heard nothing since.</p>



<p>Based on everything we know about Scalebound, would you like to see it made and finally released? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is set to be released in the summer, opening up another chapter in the decade-old open-world zombie game. As one of the most prolific games in the genre, Dying Light has enjoyed ten years in the spotlight, and that streak of success is set to persist with the arrival of the standalone game, The Beast.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Dying Light’s franchise director, Tymon Smektała, revealed that there’s a secret tucked away in the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast, and he believes nobody has found it yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easter-eggs">Easter Eggs</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://thethumbwars.com/dying-light-the-beasts-interview-exclusive-director-talks-missed-trailer-details-banned-games-and-lore-answers-10-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with The Thumb Wars</a>, Tymon Smektała suggested that the ‘general location’ of Castor Woods, the in-game map, is hidden somewhere in an easter egg in the game’s first trailer. He said it’s a ‘barely visible’ piece of text that’s written in a dialect that would ‘hint’ at where Castor Woods is located.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer, in case you want to go egg hunting:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Where is Castor Woods set?</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been through the trailer frame-by-frame, and I can’t see any unique dialect that would indicate where Castor Woods is set.</p>



<p>There are plenty of English language signs and storefronts, and everything from warning notices on generators to the emergency number on the back of police vehicles suggests we’re looking at another European adventure. The architecture is hard to pin down, though.</p>



<p>Harran, which was the centrepoint for the first game, was a fictional Middle Eastern city based on Istanbul, Mumbai, and Wroclaw. In Dying Light 2, players explore Villedor, another fictional location that’s an ‘amalgam’ of multiple European cities, including Germany, Belgium, and Poland.</p>



<p>I’m inclined to believe that Dying Light: The Beast is also set in Europe, but I can’t scale it down.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can do better – let me know in the comments if you’ve solved the easter egg.</p>

Nobody was hurt, but Hoffstetter understandably decided to conclude her marathon.</p><p>“We are all OK and have been with police,” she <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896449449100247336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter last night</a>. “We decided we are done with the marathon and need time to process! … Please send love to Emiru, Cinna, [camera person] Rosii, and Emily! Everybody is in shock but I’m so glad [we’re] together.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxaQlqmo_Zs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a follow up broadcast today</a>, Hoffstetter and Watts, still visibly shaken up, told viewers more about what happened before and after the stream clip that went viral, noting that they had to “hide in a shed for 15 minutes until cops came” after receiving what they felt was insufficient aid from workers at Santa Monica Pier (though Watts added that she didn’t think it was workers’ fault). The two also asked viewers to provide any additional details they might have to help identify the man. They went on to defend themselves against online suggestions that the situation wasn’t particularly serious because the man didn’t seem to have a weapon, which is a totally fucked thing to even need to do when there is clear video footage of <em>somebody trying to assault you</em>.</p><p>“He put his stuff on the ground to fistfight Emily,” said Hoffstetter during today’s stream.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am in hindsight very thankful that we were in the area that we were and that we were able to go into the store, because I think if we had been anywhere else on the pier, it would have been a very different situation,” said Watts. “Please take this stuff very seriously. It can happen to anybody if you’re male or female, but if you ask any girl streamer, they all have stories.”</p><p>To wit, nearly every female content creator featured in my book and many more I’ve spoken to over the years have all shared stories of stalkers and assailants, and as of last night, one, Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa – who in the past has dealt with <a href="https://gamerant.com/amouranth-stalker-update-jail-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalkers</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/amouranth-is-twitchs-smartest-troll-but-shes-on-thin-i-1847324266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swatters</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/18/twitch-amouranth-house-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even a suspected arsonist</a> – was robbed at gunpoint in her home. She tweeted about the incident <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896432533442904528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it was unfolding</a>, saying three gunmen had pistol whipped her to the point of bleeding in an attempt to get their hands on her crypto login info. Today she <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896600968797561248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted security camera footage</a> of gunmen following her into a portion of her home and then fleeing after one seemingly sustained a bullet wound.&nbsp;</p><p>“They pistol-whipped me but I got one,” Siragusa <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896433946919084342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted last night</a>. “Was at gun point they gave me phone and said log in with gun to my head, and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence.”</p><p><a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/03/popular-social-media-influencer-amouranth-pistol-whipped-in-home-invasion-robbery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Esports Advocate</a> received more details from a Houston Police Department spokesperson, saying that "during the time [the home invasion] was happening, Siragusa’s 36-year-old husband heard the commotion, armed himself, and entered the room. As the suspects attempted to flee, Siragusa’s husband was able to fire off an unknown number of shots, possibly injuring one of the suspects."</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, both Jakob Avery, managing director of Siragusa’s company, and Nick Lee, evidently still with Siragusa even after the aforementioned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 abuse incident</a>, took unspecified issue with the HPD’s account of events, but said they’d been advised against sharing more during an ongoing police investigation. Lee said that he believes he shot one of the intruders, all of whom had been in the process of drawing weapons, “aiming towards me, and shouting orders” before he opened fire.</p><p>Following the harrowing experiences of Siragusa, Hoffstetter, Watts, and Schunk – as well as those around them – many in the livestreaming community have suggested that bystanders and police will never make for sufficient protection, given their historically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/08/15/keffals-adin-ross-ishowspeed-swatting-twitch-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inconsistent responses</a> to these issues. Content creators, they say, <a href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1896465056625480016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to hire security</a>. That’s far from an option for most streamers, which <a href="https://x.com/LewSpears/status/1896496737604509800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serves as a silent deterrent for women in the space</a>. Others have pointed out that this is a multifaceted problem, and security only treats symptoms, not the sickness.</p><p>"It's not a one-off situation. It's not some random crazy guy," a streamer who goes by the handle <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blau</a> <a href="https://x.com/JojoPoehls/status/1896663929956536524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> of Hofstetter's situation during a recent broadcast. "This is the result of festering dialogue and conversation around women – around women creators especially. So before we start calling for 'Oh, we need security' [and] 'Oh, we should be more careful with IRL streams,' we need to start holding these fucking toxic clickbait engaging accounts, creators that are farming incel takes – we need to hold all of that accountable."</p><p>But in the meantime, streamers making millions, like Siragusa, can afford security. Avery told Aftermath that in Siragusa's case, that’s the plan.</p><p>“The team is currently looking to increase security on [Siragusa’s] property,” Avery said, “including more cameras, fortified perimeter, and hired security guards.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.

            <p>
If you've spent anytime at all plopping stuff down in 2019's wonderfully soothing minimalist city builder Islanders, there's a fair chance you've been won over enough that a sequel is potentially quite exciting indeed. So brace yourself: publisher Coatsink has announced Islanders: New Shores, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this "summer".
</p>
<p>
The original Islanders, to recap, was a game about strategically cramming as many amenities as possible onto a tiny (but visually pleasing) randomly generated island - all while attempting to maximise your score by making the most of each amenity's adjacency multipliers. That probably doesn't sound hugely exciting, but its chill vibes and relaxed action made for an unexpectedly hypnotic experience - a space management game as compelling as it was soothing.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Islanders: New Shores, a gently expanded follow-up promising the chance to "explore, build, and strategise like never before". This time around, Coatsink - which acquired the franchise from original developer Grizzly Games in 2022 - has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> studio The Station, and it's touting a variety of new features for its sequel.

<p>
For starters, New Shores introduces "boons" - one-time power-ups unlocked as players amass points, used to gain an advantage on tougher stages - plus two distinct modes of play in the form of High Score and Sandbox, each with their own saves. Elsewhere, there's talk of 44 unique building types and seven island properties, as well as a photo mode with its own filters and a turntable camera. You can get a taste of New Shores' action in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Islanders: New Shores just yet, but it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368930/ISLANDERS_New_Shores/">Steam</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch this "summer". And if it's anywhere near as good as its predecessor, it should be well worth keeping an eye on. Christian Donlan called the original Islanders a "thoughtful spin on strategy" and a "classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/islanders-console-edition-review-a-gloriously-dreamy-approach-to-city-building">his Recommended review</a> back in 2021.

Steamforged Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign so that those who missed out on the first campaign can enjoy the board game adaptation of Ubisoft's shooter. The campaign has two new expansions for returning fans.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/6-siege-pre-order" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign page</a>, the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game reprint will include the base game and all of its expansions. As the name implies, the game is a tabletop adaptation of Ubisoft's competitive tactical shooter.</p>

Each Operator has a unique kit or special ability, allowing you to breach through walls, fortify defenses, or set up special weapons and gadgets. The base game contained 20 Operators with the expansions introducing 40 more.</p>

<p>If you already backed the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game, this reprint campaign has two more expansions. One is a map pack, introducing the Skyscraper and Villa environments alongside cardboard obstacles. The second contains eight new Operators: Osa, Grim, Brava, Sens, Fenrir, Thorn, Solis, and Azami.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Rainbow Six: Siege board game reprint campaign has a pre-order incentive. If you back the game in advance, you'll get an alternate profile and miniature for the Zero Operator at no additional cost.</p>

<p>It has been claimed by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Warzone 3 won’t happen alongside Call of Duty 2026 if Verdansk’s revival fails to retain enough players. That includes either those currently playing or those returning for the map’s revival next month.</p>



<p>Warzone has been in a sorry spot for a while, and Verdansk’s imminent return is expected to move mountains, but for how long?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road?</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1896672391457349981">TheGhostOfHope wrote</a> a few exclusive details about Modern Warfare IV – otherwise dubbed ‘COD 2026’.</p>



<p>Amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details</a>, he claimed that Warzone 3 won’t be implemented alongside next year’s Call of Duty title if Verdansk fails to perform when it’s brought back alongside the Season 03 update. Earlier today, Activision revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">Season 03 is delayed</a> to April 3 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone to allow more time to finesse the update.</p>



<p>In March 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide pouring their hearts and souls into the battle royale. It changed the face of Call of Duty, creating an entirely new ecosystem that stood at the top of the genre for quite some time.</p>



<p>Things have changed since then, though.</p>



<p>Warzone has been on the rocks for a while, but Activision is hoping that Fornite OG-style event can bring back millions of players. It was claimed recently – also by TheGhostOfHope – that Verdansk will return as it was in 2020, which is sure to be a blast from the past for many players.</p>



<p>Do you think Verdansk is enough to save Warzone, or will the map’s imminent failure prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Call of Duty: Warzone?</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2026-is-being-developed-for-the-next-generation-xbox-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1124229/</guid>

<p>It’s been claimed that Call of Duty 2026, which is assumed to be another Modern Warfare title is in development for the next generation Xbox.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to break the news after it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 of Black Ops 6 would be delayed until April</a>. </p>



<p>According to Hope, the 2026 title is not being development for past generation consoles (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Call of Duty 2025</a>) and is being developed for the next generation of Xbox. If true, this could be our first real hint that the next-gen Xbox could release around Fall 2026.</p>



<p>Also pointed out by Hope is that apparently if Verdansk does not bring players back to Call of Duty: Warzone, a third game in the free-to-play Battle Royale will not release.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision nor Microsoft have released any information on Call of Duty 2026, or even Call of Duty 2025 at this moment in time. But according to our sources, the next game in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise is a Black Ops 2 seque</a>l headed once again by Treyarch Games following rough internal decisions that saw Sledgehammer Games wanting to develop their own fully-fledged Call of Duty title for 2027.</p>



<p>As always, take such rumors with a grain of salt, but Call of Duty 2026 being in development for the next-generation Xbox console is an interesting tidbit of information, if true.</p>



<p>What do you think of the next generation of Xbox potentially releasing in 2026? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ads for four unconfirmed Activision mobile games--Guitar Hero Mobile, Call Of Duty: Sniper, and Call Of Duty: Zombies Defender, and Crash Bandicoot Brawl--all allegedly feature what players believe to be AI-generated art.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes just a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/">Activision admitted to using AI-generated assets in Black Ops 6</a>. Additionally, it appears that some of these mobile games may not even exist, as only Guitar Hero Mobile has been officially acknowledged on Activision's social media.</p><p dir="ltr">The ads for these rumored games are reportedly appearing on Facebook and Instagram, and contain a link to a survey where players can share their opinions on the games, which have not yet been released.</p><p dir="ltr">The Guitar Hero Mobile ad in particular seems to have truly upset players who have viewed it. Art for the game features four oddly shaped guitarists, each holding an even more oddly shaped red guitar. The strange look of the ads doesn't appear to be the result of Activision trying out a new art style, but instead features what players believe to be the hallmarks of AI-generated art: blurry, oddly shaped, and non-cohesive assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Even stranger, it appears that some of these mobile games may not actually exist. Guitar Hero Mobile, Crash Bandicoot Brawl, and the Call Of Duty titles have yet to be officially announced by Activision, and Guitar Hero Mobile is the only game with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" rel="nofollow ">an ad that's viewable</a> outside of Facebook and Instagram ads.</p><p dir="ltr">Eagle-eyed fans did manage to dig up a <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" rel="nofollow ">Guitar Hero Mobile page on Geeklab</a>, a mobile marketing platform that helps developers gauge player interest. Geeklab's website says it exists to "create app store pages before the app is released, test product pages, research competitors, build assets, run surveys, run A/B tests, and optimize app stores." Clicking "get" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" rel="nofollow ">takes players to a survey</a> (also hosted on the Geeklab site).</p><p dir="ltr">The two Call Of Duty titles and the Crash Bandicoot Brawl mobile game do not yet appear to have Geeklab pages, nor do they have official pages on Activision's website, but Facebook and Instagram users are asserting that ads for all three games--plus Guitar Hero Mobile--are regularly running on the two Meta-owned social media sites. Art featured on the Guitar Hero Mobile Geeklab page also appears to include AI-generated assets, according to players. In addition to the bizarre shape of the guitarists and their instruments, the speakers on the stage appear to be facing in multiple directions at once.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you Activision," reads one sarcastic player comment on the Guitar Hero Mobile Instagram post. "Thank you for killing any interest I may have had in your games. Makes not supporting you way easier."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision declined to comment when asked about these ads and their reported use of AI-generated assets.</p>

<p>Activision has just announced the delay of the start of Season 03 of Call of Duty, which is set to herald the return of Verdansk in Warzone. Originally, the second season was set to end on March 20, but it’ll now be more than two weeks <strong>after that date </strong>that season three arrives.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Activision teased an announcement coming on Warzone’s fifth anniversary, which falls on March 10.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-delayed-but-not-for-long">Delayed, But Not For Long</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s Season 03 update will now arrive on April 3, but before we get there, the teams at Activision are preparing to make some major announcements. In 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/">Insider Gaming exclusively revealed</a> that Verdansk would be returning to Call of Duty: Warzone, and in a couple of weeks, that will be made a reality.</p>



<p>For the first time since 2021, players will be dropping in on Verdansk, which retains the original map layout gamers experienced way back in March 2020.</p>



<p>Recently, Activision also revealed the impending arrival of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-verdansk-collection-stores/">Verdansk Collection</a>, a new merch line set to hit the Call of Duty shop on March 10.</p>



<p>Here’s the social media post that announced the delay:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Season 03 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we’re taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on April 3. 

More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5th anniversary next week…</span></p></article></div>







<p>Fans of the franchise are critically aware that this has to be delivered <strong>just right</strong>, so they’re welcoming the delay with open arms. If the revival of Verdansk isn’t anything short of perfect, Activision will have a revolution on their hands. Warzone has been in the pits for the longest time, and even the game’s most prolific creators are losing interest.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to jumping back into Verdansk when it (likely) arrives with the new season on April 3? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> or in the comments.</p>
