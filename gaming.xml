			<p>Work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-visual-improvements/">Bloodborne&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-visual-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan-made remaster</a> is continuing, and judging from some recent videos, it is looking better than ever</span>.</p>
<p>Last week, fromsoftserve shared a few videos showcasing improved anti-aliasing and distant models. The modder also shared a 4 hours long video showcasing some late-game locations, which we advise you not to watch if you have never played the game and don't want to be spoiled. Needless to say, the video does an excellent job showcasing how much emulation has been improving in the past few weeks.</p>

<p>While it is definitely too early to say if there won't be any emulation issues, it looks like even a low-end, dated system may be able to run Bloodborne reasonably well via the ShadPS4 emulator in the future. A new video shared by BrutalSam showcases the game running via the emulator's 0.2.1 WIP version on a system featuring an old Intel i5-4440 CPU and a GTX 960 GPU with only 2 GB of VRAM. Performance is far from being optimal due to stuttering issues, but it's still very impressive for the emulator to run on such a dated system configuration.</p>

            <p>Valve are likely up to something hardware-related again, report <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Valve-is-testing-ARM64-support-for-popular-games-sparking-speculations-about-new-future-hardware.891851.0.html">NotebookCheck</a>. Their next chunk of plastic and wires – following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> – could swap PC gaming’s favoured x86 architecture for ARM, the type of processor favoured by the Nintendo Switch, Macs, and mobile phones.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3043620/history/?changeid=25321568">SteamDB</a> reveals a piece of software named 'ValveTestApp3043620' that's associated with dozens of PC games, ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry’s Mod</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, which in turn have tags like 'proton-arm64ec' and 'proton-arm64ec-experimental'. To "Occam’s Razor" an explanation for this, the mysterious app suggests that Valve are testing out a version of Proton (the compatibility layer that makes Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS) that could work on ARM64 processors.</p>
<p>The most boring outcome of this would be something like Valve just releasing SteamOS for MacBooks, Apple’s M series of mega-fast laptop and desktop chips being arguably the most famous examples of ARM architecture in action. Just as likely, though, is Valve assessing ARM as the basis of their next big hardware release, having stuck with x86 for the Steam Deck family.</p>

</figure>
<p>I don’t think the possibility of new Steam-branded kit is the story here – since the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-machine">Steam Machines</a>, Valve have been in the hardware game for over a decade, and have given no indications of packing it in. But the potential switch to ARM could bring some fresh possibilities, if also some risks.</p>
<p>For one thing, ARM chips are typically more power-efficient than their closest x86 counterparts, so could be very suitable as the basis for a new Steam Deck or wireless VR headset. ARM’s compatibility with the Android operating system might also make it a lot easier to add your favourite mobile games to your PC library; outside of emulation, this is only possible on x86 hardware in very narrow, limited ways.</p>
<p>However, the big challenge – for Valve and for Proton – would be maintaining performance and compatibility. While modern ARM chips are no less powerful than x86 ones, the fact that most PC games are built exclusively for the latter could pose problems in keeping framerates up. This isn’t so much of an issue when Proton is tricking Windows games into running on SteamOS, as both platforms were built with x86 in mind, but enabling those games on the completely different ARM64 architecture would presumably involve something more like full emulation. Which, generally, slows down performance.</p>
<p>Still, Proton’s whole job is to headbutt compatibility barriers into matchsticks, so who knows. And regarding the hardware itself, I’m not convinced it’s going to be an ARM-powered Steam Deck, partly because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-oled-is-here-but-valve-say-not-to-expect-a-true-next-gen-steam-deck-for-a-long-time">Valve told me last November</a> that a next-gen Deck is likely years away. A standalone VR headset is a decent bet, though given ARM has muscled its way into Mac Pros, its efficiency benefits don’t necessary mean portable use only. A new generation of Steam Machines, perchance? Watch this space.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s developers already have ideas for a DLC or sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Saber Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer, Tim Willits, spoke about their plans for a DLC or sequel. Willits stated that Space Marine 2’s game director has already “proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the dev team is currently taking a breather, they are committed to providing long-term support for Space Marine 2. Willits has confidently assured that they will not let down the Warhammer fans and are hopeful to be working on Space Marine content for a considerable time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speaking about DLC content for Space Marine 2, Willits stated that one major reason for having 25 million players in World War Z was releasing new content such as DLC packs, free classes, and more. He added that whenever they released such content, the team would observe a spike in sales as well as player count.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Willits also expressed his excitement about the future of Space Marine 2, stating that its success has changed their approach to everything. He shared, “This changes everything we do moving forward, from our small games like our third-party publishing games to A Quiet Place next month. We have Toxic Command coming up with Focus soon. Everything that we do now, this changes.”</p>

			<p>There are unusual names in gaming. Some evocative, some mysterious, and some that leave you with eternal questions about what the game is actually about. Caravan SandWitch manages the feat of being all three. That sense of mystery lies at the heart of Plane Toast’s laidback sci-fi adventure, as you explore the crumbling remains of a distant, insignificant planet, far from anywhere important.</p>

<p>Caravan SandWitch asks many questions in its relatively short runtime. Questions about loyalty and loss, about tenacity and tribulation, and about knowing when to let go. It’s surprising just how thoughtful it is, and how often the remaining inhabitants of this planet will tug at your heartstrings.</p>


<p>You’re Sauge. Called back to your home planet Cigalo by your sister Garance’s distress signal. The thing is, Garance has been missing for years, and the mixture of hope and hopelessness that this distress signal causes is well played out. After hopping on a space train home – soundtracked by some gorgeous French vocals courtesy of composer Antynomy – you find that Cigalo is on the decline, with few families remaining in the remnants of your homestead.</p>


<p>You’re given use of a gloriously chunky yellow caravan, and it’s in this that you set out to explore the surface of Cigalo. There’s the remains of various industrial sites strewn across the landscape, and you have the time to thoroughly explore each of them, discovering new pieces of tech, or simply marvelling at the forgotten corners of this distant world, sitting down to take in a stunning vista. Cigalo still plays home to various people, those who can’t or won’t leave, and along the way you can accept quests to make their lives just a little bit easier, helping to slow the seemingly inevitable decay of this planet and its occupants.</p>
<p>The central loop of Caravan SandWitch is Metroid-esque, as you gain new abilities for yourself and your caravan, which allow you to access previously impassable sections of the terrain. The way you do this is to collect components from the various bits of machinery lying unused around the world, before returning them to your hometown for the new parts to be fabricated.</p>
<p>At times, Caravan SandWitch can feel a little stretched out, the component requirements necessitating a lengthy scavenging session, but once you settle into the laidback, timeless nature of adventuring here, any frustrations melt away. There’s no combat, just clambering, scanning the environment and tootling about in your caravan looking for parts, all of which is consistently enjoyable.</p>

<p>For a sci-fi game, set within this crumbling and forgotten landscape, Caravan Sand Witch is surprisingly whimsical. It’s gentle and touching in a way that most games simply can’t be, furthering the idea that indie games allow far more innovation and emotion than their AAA peers.</p>
<p>I love the art direction here – there’s a particularly French feel to the design of the characters and the choice of gentle pastel colours – and it feels like the sci-fi sister to recent games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/03/dordogne-review/">Dordogne</a>. The fact that it’s paired with Antynomy’s evocative soundscape, the synth-led tones helping to add to the sense of distance, melancholy and mystery, and you have an audio-visual delight that few can match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-rocksteady-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Batman Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios is working on a new game starring the Dark Knight, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Earlier today, XboxEra's Shpeshal Nick said on X that he had heard that Rocksteady Studios was working specifically on a new Batman game, not a remaster or remake of previous entries in the series. Apparently, Sony is also trying to money-hat the game, so it may end up being a PlayStation console exclusive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not sure which studio people’s dream is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it. I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol <a href="https://t.co/EfcyRKWdZI">https://t.co/EfcyRKWdZI</a></p>
<p>— Marvel vs CapNick  (@Shpeshal_Nick) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1838116987236655458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Rocksteady Studios' latest project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, failed by all metrics, it makes sense for the studio to go back to the character that propelled the studio among the most respected development studios ever. Still, without an official confirmation, which may not be coming for some time, we have to take this reveal with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>The latest entry in Rocksteady Studios' popular series is Batman Arkham Knight, which introduced a much bigger map than its predecessor, and the Batmobile, which ended up being one of the game's most important features. <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">Last year</a>, the game was ported to Nintendo Switch with some baffling results, as the game ran at a staggering 0 frames per second in certain scenarios at launch. The game is also well-remembered by the PC community due to its horrible port, which required plenty of time and work to get fixed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-amd-bid-didn%E2%80%99t-go-through-due-to-handheld-mode-performance-and-efficiency-leaks-suggest-excellent-battery-life.988692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 had the chance to be powered by AMD, but the company lost the bid to produce the next Nintendo system due to handheld mode performance and power efficiency, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, AMD lost the bid due to its chip's performance and efficiency at 5 watts. The company reportedly wanted Nintendo to push the system in handheld mode at up to 15 watts to get truly next-generation performance, but the Japanese company didn't want to push its console that far, as they didn't want to have a heavier battery. Ultimately, NVIDIA's chip provided the same power as the AMD chip with much better efficiency and a far cheaper node, which was very important for Nintendo to keep costs low.</p>
<p>Battery life is likely&nbsp;<span>to be one of the highlights of the Nintendo Switch 2. Judging from last week's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaks</a>, the battery should provide around 20 wh, a slightly higher capacity than the original Switch battery. However, the system will consume way less power in handheld mode than its predecessor, granting much better battery life than the current generation console.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Intel Arrow Lake Cinebench 1T Leak | Nintendo Switch 2 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qlOQg2mEsw?start=508&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With leaks intensifying in the past few days, there's no doubt that an official reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 is not too far off. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Shirley Curry, aka the "Skyrim Grandma", is no longer posting gaming videos, she's told her viewers. An upcoming eye surgery is going to leave her recovering for some weeks and (more importantly to her) she is simply tired of playing games for an audience. </p>
<p>"It isn't fun anymore," she says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo">in a video</a>. "I'm tired of it. I'm bored with it, bored to death with it. So I am making the decision now - totally, finally - I am not going to be making any more gaming videos and uploading them."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the video message, she talks frankly about the dwindling desire to record her exploits in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>.

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>"It seems like I spend most of my time sitting in here at this computer," she said. "And lately... I walk in here and look at my computer and think: 'I've got to make a video today'. And then I just shake my head at myself and say: 'I don't want to, I have no desire to'. And I turn around and walk back out."</p>
<p>Over her time as a player of Skyrim, Curry has gained over 1.29 million subscribers on YouTube, (but she jokes she can count the number of actual regular viewers on two hands). She became popular enough that Bethesda scanned her likeness and have pledged to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-to-become-npc-in-the-elder-scrolls-vi">immortalize her as an NPC</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-news-exclusivity-races-setting">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, whatever it turns out to be. </p>
<p>Now, instead of gaming, she's going to spend time on other interests. And she might make infrequent videos about those, she says. She's fed up with doing it for gaming, specifically. But reading and other hobbies might still bring her to the camera now and then.</p>
<p>"I'm going to start making a quilt that I've been wanting to make for a long time. I designed the
squares a long time ago... and I will show you it bit by bit as I make it.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you something about a book I'm reading, tell you a little bit about it, just in case you'd like to read it."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the octagenarian YouTuber has cut down on her vlogging. In 2020 she was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-grandma-cuts-back-on-videos-after-pushy-comments">worn down by the time and energy demands</a> of making videos and started to do less. But, as she notes in this video, the amount of work would often creep back up over time. It's something she doesn't want to repeat, it seems, as she finds it difficult now to simply stay engaged.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, when I wake up of a morning and I'm so comfy in the bed, and it just feels so good and I think: 'Oh my goodness I've been here all night long, I'd love to just lay here all snuggled up all day long'. Isn't that terrible?"</p>
<p>Not terrible at all, if you ask me. I think about my computer some days and want to do the exact same. It isn't surprising to see Curry face similar difficulties to most vloggers and streamers too - pressure, tedium, expectation, "metrics" worries, personal health concerns... It doesn't really matter if you're in your 20s or your 80s. Work is work, and sometimes it's best to cut it out. My thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-hundreds-of-videos-over-9-years-88-year-old-skyrim-grandma-is-retiring-because-it-isnt-fun-anymore-im-tired-of-it-im-bored-to-death-with-it/">GamesRadar</a> for spotting this story.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> on PC last week, producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-doesnt-want-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods-on-pc-release">Naoki Yoshida asked fans to not mod "anything offensive or inappropriate" into the game</a>.</p>
<p>So far, modders have been pretty well-behaved, but Clive voice actor Ben Starr has of course made it into the game. I was expecting his face to be put on Clive's model (there's still time for that), but instead it's his glowing face from The Game Awards that's been added to Clive's cape.</p>

<p>Other mods have a more direct impact on gameplay. Modder Dehnonator has created a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/15">cheat table mod</a> that unlocks the higher difficulty Final Fantasy Mode from the start - as well as the Arcade mode's Ultimaniac difficulty.</p>
<p>Essentially, that means players can have a higher difficulty level but with base game stats for a particularly challenging playthrough. That appears to be what X user Limitless is running, but without using potions too.</p>

<p>You may then want to add in Akeela_Darchiev's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/23">Reduced Skill Cooldowns mod</a>, which reduces the waiting time between using Eikon abilities and so increases the tempo of combat.</p> <div>

<p>Combine that with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/26">another mod from Dadadada</a> and you really do get Devil May Clive (see header image).</p>

            <p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game - a game about "finding joy in the small moments" and living as a hobbit - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire players will be able to take part in a number of cosy, hobbit activities, such as fishing, gathering mushrooms and cooking up meals for their friends, when the game makes its debut. They will also be able to personalise their inherited hobbit hole, to just how they like it.</p>

<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-the-shire-wants-to-fulfil-the-fantasy-of-living-out-your-cosy-hobbit-dreams">cosy hobbit life sim from Wētā Workshop and Private Division</a> was initially slated for a release in the latter half of this year. However, earlier this month, the team announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">pushing its launch back into early 2025</a>, to make sure the game lives up to the studio's vision.</p>
<p>While the Tales of the Shire developer did not announce the release date at this time, as part of yesterday's Hobbit Day showcase (which you can check out above), it confirmed the game will now launch on 25th March.

</div><div>



            <p>Earlier in the month, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a> publisher Annapurna Interactive’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">entire staff resigned</a> after a dispute with boss Megan Ellison. Reported by<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling"> Bloomberg</a> as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation"> new report</a> from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prior to 2024, write IGN, tensions were already present. Opinions of Ellison within Annapurna Interactive "varied from indifference to latent mistrust given previous reports on her behavior toward employees," with anonymous sources citing "a strong fear of reprisal from Ellison in particular, given her resources, history, and reach."</p>
<p>Still, IGN also reports that work at Annapurna Interactive was "business-as usual" up until mid-March of this year, when employees were "suddenly informed" that co-founder and Annapurna Pictures CEO James Masi had been let go, causing a shake-up that reached right up to Annapurna president Nathan Gary. Annapurna claim that Ellison "reinstalled Gary as head of Interactive, and deemed Masi’s role unnecessary" - only for Gary to also leave the company around the same time. From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sources say employees were told in the following days by leadership within Annapurna Interactive that Gary had been fired along with Masi. The belief that two of their leaders had been fired seemingly out of the blue sparked confusion and fury, and a handful of individuals quit in protest, including at least one other Interactive leader.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ellison then held a video call, and "all the departed staff returned, including Gary and Masi, and discussions began for a potential spin-off of the company". The plan was for Gary and Annapurna Interactive’s staff to form a new company, named Verset, that would oversee currently existing Interactive projects. The developers that IGN spoke to were aware of the plans, and "were reassured their contracts would be fulfilled."</p>
<p>Verset was to become "the company’s indie arm," with former Sony producer Hector Sanchez to lead AAA and AA projects. This included "transmedia properties" - hence the recently announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">Remedy deals</a>. A lack of internal communication regarding these plans, however, lead to employees feeling "confused, concerned, and frustrated about the direction of the company and the future of its Interactive division, Verset or no Verset."</p>
<p>Around this time, write IGN, "discussions with Ellison regarding the spin-off appeared to have stalled out, and in August Annapurna officially terminated discussion." In a statement to IGN, Annapurna claim that "any implication Annapurna was backtracking on the deal is false. We agreed to high-level deal terms and signed a term sheet in early April, which makes it all the more surprising that we never got a response."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Stray-close-up-cat.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Multiple sources told IGN that, in the months leading up to the walk-out, they "began to see signs of Ellison exercising greater involvement over Annapurna Interactive's deals, projects, and budgets in a way that began to make them further uncomfortable with the direction the company was taking."</p>
<p>At the end of August, all 25 employees of the company - including Gary, Masi, and the rest of leadership - signed a joint resignation letter, giving two weeks' notice before departing the company on the 6th of September. This left Ellison, Sanchez, and CSO Paul Doyle "working on a semblance of Annapurna's gaming efforts." Despite the two week’s notice, IGN write, partner developers were not informed of the upcoming resignations. From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Annapurna Interactive sources say they received no guidance from the company during that period as to who should tell developers, when, and how. An Annapurna spokesperson reached out post-publication to IGN to deny this, claiming it had active and open conversations with the Interactive staff on how to communicate the news.</p></blockquote>
<p>As it stands now, IGN say that Annapurna have "splintered into two groups both of which are now working to pick up the pieces". On one side, the 25 departed staff that form the remains of Annapurna Interactive ("or perhaps a future Verset"), and on the other, a "tiny leadership team" at Annapurna to support "around 40 projects". An Annapurna spokesperson shared the following statement with IGN:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole situation is a baffler, but now we're focused on moving forward. We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership. If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hiring though!</p>

            <p>
Sony's eye-catching PlayStation 5 30th Anniversary Edition bundles were announced last week with a key component missing - the prices. 
</p>
<p>
Now, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-les-prix-de-quelques-references-des-editions-limitees-du-30eme-anniversaire-playstation-59567">Dealabs</a>' reliable leaker bilbil-kun has obtained US pricing information, and found the PS5 Slim 30th Anniversary bundle will cost $499.99 - a $50 increase on the usual model. This will likely translate to £449.99 here in the UK, and around €519.99 in mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>
Included in this bundle is the PS5 Digital Edition console, DualSense, a faceplate, a vertical stand, plus collectors items including a sticker.

<p>
The DualSense 30th Anniversary limited edition controller will meanwhile cost $79.99, with local pricing likely £69.99 in the UK and €79.99 in Europe. PlayStation typically sells DualSense for £65 here in the UK, around a fiver cheaper.
</p>
<p>
There's still no word yet on how much more the 30th Anniversary Edition version of the PS5 Pro will cost. As a reminder, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">vanilla version is priced at £700</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's 30th Anniversary Edition range will become available to pre-order via direct.playstation.com on 26th September, ahead of the range's release on 21st November, though stock will be limited.
</p>
<p>
Sony has cautioned that the collection will only be available "while supplies last", with the PS5 Pro in particular limited to just 12,300 consoles worldwide. Scalping seems inevitable.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> was released on PC last week and has set the fourth-highest concurrent player count for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> game on Steam.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 27,508 (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2515020/charts/">SteamDB</a>).</p>
<p>That beats out the likes of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1462040/charts/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> (13,803), <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2552450/charts/">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX</a> (11,152), and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2552430/charts/">NieR: Automata</a> (23,908), but remains behind <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/637650/charts/">Final Fantasy 15</a> (29,498) and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1113560/charts/">NieR: Replicant</a> (28,684).</p>

<p>It's no surprise that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/39210/charts/">Final Fantasy 14</a> remains the most played Square Enix game on Steam, with 95,150 concurrent players.</p>
<p>So while there's been criticism online for Final Fantasy 16's launch - particularly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Square Enix itself said its PS5 release underperformed</a> - its concurrent player count suggests it's beating out some of the company's most popular games.</p>
<p>Still, it remains behind another previously PS5 exclusive game, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2322010/charts/">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which also released on PC last week and reached a peak concurrent player count of 35,615. And that's despite being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-being-review-bombed-on-steam">review-bombed for its required PSN login</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/">Steam overall hit a new peak concurrent player count</a> this weekend: 38,367,277 users.</p>
<p>The previous peak was 37,240,223, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-prompts-yet-another-steam-record">release of Black Myth: Wukong last month</a>.</p>
<p>The new peak was due to huge numbers of players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, PUBG, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in a previous article, Steam users are blasting God of War Ragnarok for Sony's decision to mandate linking of a PlayStation Network account to play the game, as well as for some performance issues.</p>
<p>Thankfully, iArtorias already created a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mod&nbsp;</a>that removes the PSN account requirement by stripping away the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement. To install the mod, just download the latest release and copy the version.dll and PsPcSdk.dll files to the game folder. The modder also noted that users still encountering the login screen error should remove this file: C:\Users\[Username]\\Saved Games\God of War Ragnarök\[AccountID]\userpreferences. Also, upon the first popup that asks to link the Steam account, press the "NO" button.&nbsp;Some users have reported that blocking the GoWR.exe file with the firewall also helps in some cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, God of War Ragnarok PC port developer Jetpack Interactive has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2322010/view/4683269973728704642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a second patch during the weekend, fixing NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation would not properly initialize</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with NVIDIA Reflex would show as disabled in the UI when enabling Frame Generation</li>
<li>Fixed some timing markers with NVIDIA Reflex</li>
<li>Fixed the UI not showing Surround Sound in Audio Calibration</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where surround sound would apply stereo audio mixing causing some sounds to be too quiet or loud</li>
<li>Fixed UI controller icons being low resolution and blurry in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where controls would not work during quicktime events if Interact/Evade were swapped in addition to having Steam Input enabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on Steam Deck with a button not being mapped blocking completing a tutorial moment</li>
<li>No longer blocking GPUs with less than 6GB of VRAM from launching the game</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt, more patches will follow to improve the optimization of God of War Ragnarok to lift interest in the game (so far, it <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2322010/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peaked</a> at 35.6K concurrent users on Steam, which is less than half of the previous installment's peak).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s wild to think that it’s already been almost two years since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a> first came out. This past year, Sony has found their biggest successes from games that break out of their traditional narrative third-person adventure format – titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a>, specifically. It’s not easy to forget the kind of Hollywood-level, big budget games that Sony has traditionally been focusing on for much of the past decade. This PC re-release of God of War Ragnarok is a great reminder of just how visually jaw-dropping Sony games can be, and that magic comes across on a new platform with hardly any issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarök - Launch Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBwxyqq1ON4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On a PlayStation 5, the amount of accessibility and experience-customizing settings available in God of War Ragnarok are exhaustive and detailed. All of those settings carry over to this PC release, allowing you to fine-tune gameplay features, audio settings, camera controls, input options and so much more. For a lot of these options, they’re equally useful as either accessibility tools for gamers who need them or for simply making certain aspects of the game experience more convenient for you.</p>


<p>There’s even been a subtle tweak for the hints system, with a new setting for the PC version of the game letting you reduce the frequency of puzzle hints coming from your companions – this setting is also being rolled back to console with an update. Given that one of the main frustrations keen gamers had with Ragnarok was just how chatty and revealing these were, it’s good to have this option added.</p>


<p>Alongside all of that, though, is a massive amount of graphics settings tailored specifically to the PC – and Steam Deck – experience. Options for upscaling tech like DLSS and FSR and XeSS are available on day one, alongside an additional frame generation option. They’re the icing on the cake of all the specific granular graphics options you’d want to be able to tweak on PC, and with added support for ultra-wide screens. It’s shockingly easy to get God of War Ragnarok running on a variety of hardware at a solid frame rate and impressive visual quality – then again, it was designed with the base PS4 in mind.</p>
<p>The graphically rich, 4K world of God of War Ragnarok comes at the price of storage space, though. While the original PS5 release of the game took around 85GB up on your console, this PC release requires a staggering 176GB to be installed, and on an SSD, no less. There’s a reason people make memes about western game devs and the astronomical sizes of their games, and this release isn’t doing anything to help beat those allegations. I’m someone who enjoys having a variety of games installed and sitting around, just in case I decide to get to playing one of them when I’m in a certain mood. With God of War Ragnarok, you and your PC’s SSD need to be prepared and locked in to play nothing but this game, and that’s especially true on Steam Deck.</p>

<p>You’ll also need your PSN account prepared, which has already been a massive mark of controversy for Sony this year. After announcing that Helldivers 2 would suddenly require PSN-account linking months after release, players boycotted the game in hordes and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">eventually forced Sony’s hand into reversing that decision</a>. It has not been reversed for God of War Ragnarok though, and if you don’t have or sign up for a PSN account, you can’t play. If you live in one of the 100+ regions Sony has blocked from being able to purchase this game because PSN accounts aren’t available there, you also cannot play.</p>
<p>It’s a disappointing decision Sony has taken an incredibly firm stance on, and it’s a decision that seems so baffling in how little it benefits anyone involved – Sony included. There’s a certain justification for an online multiplayer game to require a PSN account to be connected, but it’s thinly-justified for a single-player story game to have that same requirement. Is it just stat padding for their next investor call?</p>

<p>For anyone comfortable with tackling the hurdles outlined above, God of War Ragnarok will be a flawless experience for you on PC. I was impressed by how gorgeous it looked and sounded on my desktop, and blown away by how similar the experience was when I brought it over to my Steam Deck. In many ways, the PC releases that Sony puts out of their games feel like the optimal way to experience them. God of War Ragnarok continues that trend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-release-date-revealed-alongside-new-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ten days ago, Private Division and Wētā Workshop <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-is-delayed-to-early-2025-to-deliver-the-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that their cozy single player life simulation game Tales of the Shire would be delayed to early 2025.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the Hobbit Day celebration, we got the new release date: March 25, 2025. That wasn't all, however, as the developers also provided a lengthy gameplay showcase.</p>
<p><em>We love Hobbits, and with Tales of the Shire, we want to immerse you in their world. That could mean tending your garden season by season, seeing what you can catch in Bywater pool, or just taking a stroll by the creek and enjoying the day. We knew that capturing the feeling of the Shire was really crucial to our player experience. The Shire is easygoing. It's a place where Hobbits rest in the afternoon sun on a cool summer's day. It's joyous, it's full of the laughter of chitchatting neighbors, and it's cozy. It's a place where you can cuddle up in your own Hobbit hole with a hot cup of tea.</em></p>
<p><em>One of our biggest goals is to really deliver on these feelings and immerse the players in them. Every aspect of the game has been carefully crafted drawing on our years of experience with The Lord of the Rings and with Tolkien's books always as our guide. Each bridge, path, plant, Hobbit home, and second breakfast is drawn from the original vision the game is a homage to all those wonderful details and the spirit we fell in love with when we first encountered the Shire.</em></p>
<p><em>The core of our game centers on building community and fellowship. You spend your time in the village of Bywater helping to lift the community up and sharing home-cooked meals with other Hobbits. As your ties to the community of Bywater and your bonds with your friends grow, your fellowship increases, which allows you to progress in the story.</em></p>

<p>Tales of the Shire will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. Pricing info hasn't been shared yet.</p>

            <p>Raise your thumb if you’ve ever impaled it on a HeroQuest skeleton’s scythe. Country’s gone soft these days, I tell you. I’ve seen those new Heroquest skellies. You couldn’t injure yourself on those scythes if you tried. It’s polearm-ical correctness gone mad! Well, good news if you’re nostalgic for a simpler time, where tiny scythes could maim you for life, and binary digits came in lots of eight and not a binary digit more. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-shadowgate">Beyond Shadowgate</a> is a vastly-expanded, modernised sequel to the classic NES adventure, created by the original’s designers, and it just released last week.</p>

<p>“With a world that is over five times larger than Shadowgate, Beyond Shadowgate captures the same look and feel as the 8-bit console version while including modern design sensibilities,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2332240/Beyond_Shadowgate/">Steam page</a>. How does one measure the size of a labyrinthine fantasy world, exactly? Ah, they’ve got a graph and everything! 250 rooms! 40 monsters! 180+ deaths! Oh! I’ve written about how much I love bespoke death events before, so this speaks to me. Here’s some story:</p>
<blockquote><p>35 years have passed since Jair defeated the Warlock Lord in the caverns beneath the living castle, Shadowgate. In that time, the land of Kal Torlin prospered and the events of Shadowgate were forgotten. But once again evil is stirring, scheming to bring the world to ruin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, 35 actual real-life years, I getcha. That 35 years also buys you a new hint system, controller support, day/night progression, and a few more modern bells and whistles. The developers' last outing was a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1822970/Shadowgate_VR_The_Mines_of_Mythrok/">VR adventure in the same series</a>, and while it looks reasonably handsome, I’m much more drawn to the lovely retro art in this one. I get the sense a fair few people were excited for it, hence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-forgotten-point-and-click-adventure-is-getting-an-official-sequel-35-years-later">its succesful Kickstarter</a>. Did you play Shadowgate? Should <em>I</em> play Shadowgate? Would you... <em>kiss</em> Shadowgate? Let me know!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The success of breakout hit <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> ‘changes everything’ for developer Saber Interactive, it’s said.</p><p>Speaking exclusively to IGN as part of a sweeping post-launch interview just over two weeks after Space Marine 2’s record-breaking launch, Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits said the success of the game would even positively affect its future projects.</p><p>While neither Saber nor publisher Focus Entertainment have announced a sales figure for Space Marine 2, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-to-get-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more-in-first-patch">Focus has confirmed over two million played at launch</a>. In fact, Space Marine 2 is the most-played Warhammer video game of any type ever released on Steam, with 225,690 peak concurrent players on Valve’s platform.</p><p>Willits won't go into hard numbers for Space Marine 2's success, either in revenue or profit terms, but he has gone on the record to say <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-id-software-execs-space-marine-2-is-selling-faster-than-any-of-their-games-including-doom-and-quake">Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on</a>, and that includes all the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, and Rage games id Software released over the 24 years he was at the studio.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Willits revealed that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he was id Software studio director on before leaving to join Saber in 2019. The suggestion here, of course, is that Space Marine 2, whose standard edition currently costs $59.99 on Steam and $69.99 on console, is already a highly profitable endeavor for all involved.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/23/gettyimages-971263864-1727078532488.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tim Willits. Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While Space Marine 2 leans on the power of Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 brand, its back-to-basics approach to the action genre and eye-catching alien swarm tech that puts hundreds of Tyranid creatures on-screen at once has wowed critics and gamers. Just shy of three weeks from release, Willits is hopeful Space Marine 2 will end up seeing the sort of player numbers Saber’s co-op zombie shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a> has. World War Z, whose zombie swarm tech was used as the basis of Space Marine 2's Tyranid swarm tech, has seen 25 million players since going on sale in 2019.</p><p>“With Space Marine 2, it really does change everything,” Willits said. “During our company party, I gave a little 30-second speech and I told the whole team, this changes everything we do moving forward, from our small games like our third-party publishing games, to A Quiet Place next month. We have Toxic Command coming up with Focus soon. Everything that we do now, this changes.</p><p>“And as employees, and I know this firsthand, when you have a big hit and you have that internet kind of popularity, there's more passion and there's more responsibility for the quality that you do. And you look at yourself through a different lens. And sometimes that success lens can be a little dangerous because then you get so paranoid about making sure everything is great that you overstress about things, but it's that success lens that really drives amazing games into the future. So I do believe that through the success lens that we have, we will just make far better products in the future.”</p><p>In practical terms, the success of Space Marine 2 means Saber staff can now “dream bigger,” Willits said. Saber will make good on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-explains-warhammer-40000-lore-restrictions-that-prevent-chaos-for-every-class-in-big-update-on-what-to-expect-in-the-future">its original post-launch plan</a>, which involves new missions, modes, maps, enemies, and weapons, but it will also make "adjustments" fueled by Space Marine 2’s now confirmed success — once the dust settles.</p><p>There is now the possibility of story DLC, Willits confirmed, with ideas floating around for a potential Space Marine 3. Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3">IGN has reported on the probably new enemy faction we’ll see in Space Marine 3</a>), and given the success of the game, this is now a case of when, not if.</p><p>“Our game director Dmitry Grigorenko, he has proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel,” Willits said. “We're literally just catching our breath. This is two weeks out. We just need to get the dust to settle. But I can confidently say that we will not disappoint our Warhammer fans in the future. It's too big of a success! I know that's an obvious thing to say, but hopefully we'll be working on Space Marine content for a long time.”</p><p>For Space Marine 3, Willits said, Saber would need to work with publisher Focus as well as Games Workshop once again. "We just have to figure it out. I would love to do it, yes,” he continued. “Yes, yes, yes! There's so many different factions... there are other chapters, too, that are interesting...”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In the shorter term, Saber is working on adding new classes, which will be released for free and, hopefully, will add some variety to Space Marine 2's gameplay. Willits wouldn’t be drawn on which classes are coming, though fans are hopeful for a Chaplain or an Apothecary. The post-launch plan, though, is informed by the continued success of World War Z, which has retained a loyal player base through the release of new and free classes in the years since launch.</p><p>“One of the reasons why we got 25 million people in World War Z is because every time we release a new DLC pack or a free class and we had a sale, people buy it. We literally see a spike,” Willits said. “We put out a video promoting a new character pack, we see a spike in sales. So it just drives attention and drives awareness.</p><p>“There's always one guy that says, ‘guys, come on, there's new stuff coming up.’ And then, 'okay,' so three other people are like, 'it's only five bucks, let's buy it.' And so you get this kind of group FOMO thing going on that really helps. And we had so much success with that model. That's what we'll do.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are focused on development. We look forward to sharing more when the time is right. There you go, brother.</p></div><p>Saber is already thinking about its other announced games in development as it continues to shift staff from projects ramping down to projects ramping up. Willits has already mentioned <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">A Quiet Place The Road Ahead</a>, a video game based on the hit horror movie franchise it's publishing next month, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a>, another co-op focused shooter that makes use of Saber’s swarm tech. With Space Marine 2 out the door, expect to hear more on Toxic Commando soon.</p><p>Then, there’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park Survival</a>, a single-player action adventure game set on Isla Nublar the day after the events of the beloved 1993 Jurassic Park film. There’s no release date on that one. And, further ahead, the big one: Saber’s troubled Star Wars <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake">The Knights of the Old Republic remake</a>, which the company continues to insist is in development.</p><p>When asked if the success of Space Marine 2 had increased the likelihood of KOTOR becoming a reality, Willits, expecting to be asked about the MIA remake, turned to a prepared statement:</p><p>“Right now, we are focused on development. We look forward to sharing more when the time is right. There you go, brother.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is just a couple of weeks away from launching. Fans are counting the hours down to return to the namesake town from Maine, United States, and today, we've got an unexpected treasure trove of new footage to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>The source is Spanish content creator MenosTrece, who <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2256710796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streamed</a> several hours of gameplay from the PC review build of the Silent Hill 2 remake on Twitch. Needless to say, unless he got special permission from KONAMI, the live stream violated the embargo and thus will be taken down as soon as possible by the publisher (and the content creator might face legal trouble, too). As such, if you're eager to check out the footage, watch it right away rather than waiting until a later time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the video quality is not so great, not even reaching the Full HD option. Still, we've embedded it below in case you want to watch it.</p>

<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was developed by Bloober Team, is powered by Unreal Engine 5, and will launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on October 8. Just recently, the latest trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-wont-be-available-on-other-consoles-until-10-08-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the game won't be available on other platforms (mainly Xbox consoles) until at least October 10, 2025.</p>

			<p>God of War Ragnarök is now facing "review bombing" on Steam, following Sony's requirement that PC users connect to a PSN account, in a repeat of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-steam-reviews-crash-following-news-of-mandatory-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2 review bombing</a> for the same reason. Sony eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverted</a> the mandatory PSN account, but that was only because, at launch, it hadn't been the case, and people were pissed they could no longer play the game they had purchased.</p>
<p>The PC port of God of War Ragnarök was a highly awaited title among fans, mainly due to the original hype built by the console release, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a perfect score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>God of War Ragnarok is exactly what we hoped for, and even more. It offers a masterfully told story using a more mature approach, seasoned with a unique setting, a rich characterization of the characters, and challenges that can keep even hardcore gamers busy at the highest difficulties. In other words, it is a title that is simply just too good to be missed.</em></p>
<p>The game finally debuted on the PC platform this week, nearly two years after its PS5 launch. As mentioned above, it became a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">victim of review bombing</a> by Steam fans, who are disappointed by the requirement to link a PSN account to play the game. Fans say that the whole "identification" process is a complete disaster, especially when it comes to submitting documents and government-issued IDs.</p>
<p>Here is how a user has expressed his sentiments against the decision, backed by the fact that such a decision puts user data at risk and can potentially lead to identity theft.</p>
<p><em>There is NO reason a single player offline experience should require any third-party login—especially a PSN account on a PC platform. This provides no benefit to the customer and only worsens the overall experience, adding unnecessary security risks on top of being an inconvenience to the user and not even allowing people in certain countries to have access to it.</em></p>
<p>This isn't the only reason the God of War Ragnarök has negative reviews. Other users claim that the game is filled with bugs, including crashes due to "lack of VRAM" along with lower frame rates (despite the presence of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-to-boost-performance-in-god-of-war-ragnarok-final-fantasy-xvi-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-and-enotria-the-last-song/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3</a>) and bad optimization. So, while several positive reviews are appreciating the port, it looks like most of them are commenting on the game's questionable state on PC. The port was handled by Jetpack Interactive, which also worked on bringing the previous installment to PC and will surely attempt to improve the optimization issues through patches.&nbsp;The PSN account problem, however, rests entirely in Sony's hands.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-6-update-console-mobile/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stardew-valley%E2%80%99s-1-6-update-is-coming-to-console-and-mobile-on-november-4.988596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-6-update-console-mobile/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Stardew Valley’s developer, ConcernedApe, has confirmed that the long-awaited 1.6 update is arriving on console and mobile platforms on November 4. Back in March 2024, 1.6 was deployed on PC, adding a string of updates to the game that console and mobile players have been patiently awaiting for these past few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-1-6">What’s in 1.6?</h2>



<p>Stardew Valley’s 1.6 update added a bunch of new content to the game.</p>



<p>The core features of the update revolved around new festivals and events, as well as a mastery system and a new farm type. This is the ‘Meadowlands Farm’ that proved to be a favourite with fans shortly after it was added to the game.</p>



<p>ConcernedApe expanded NPC dialogue, incorporating new gift reactions, and patching up missing dialogue that had been presenting an issue for quite some time.</p>



<p>Pets were also added, and they were given the ability to love their owner based on gifts received.</p>



<p>Per the seasonal rotation of the game, NPCs were given ‘winter outfits’ to keep them on theme.</p>



<p>These updates all came in side-by-side with stacks of new items, renovation options, crops, fish, and interactions with the environment. It was one of the biggest updates in Stardew Valley history, and it’s not long until console and mobile players can get their hands on it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Release date for Stardew Valley console &amp; mobile 1.6 update: November 4th</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1837953798289199323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Stardew continues to be one of the world’s most popular ‘cosy’ games, with some content creators having based their entire persona around this one game. It’s constantly sitting high in the charts on gaming and streaming platforms worldwide, and it remains a wonder that it was all pieced together by a single developer.</p>



<p>ConcernedApe confirmed that on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, the 1.6 update will be deployed on November 4. It’s better late than never, right?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online Has Made $15 Million a Month For 10 Years, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-15m-a-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-online-has-made-15-million-a-month-for-10-years-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.988593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-15m-a-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been suggested that The Elder Scrolls Online, which was released in 2014, has made $15 million every month since it launched. This claim goes hand-in-hand with a report that ‘ESO’, which is maintained by ZeniMax Online Studios, has raked in a whopping $2 billion since 2014.</p>



<p>Elder Scrolls Online is one of the most popular MMORPGs ever made. It allows players to explore the many realms that makeup Tamriel, the fictional setting of The Elder Scrolls universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-septims-is-that">How Many Septims Is That?</h2>



<p>The ‘$15 million a month’ reference was dug up <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1836976910628159719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Timur222 on Twitter</a>, who found the number on the profile of Gary Boodhoo, a former UX lead at ZeniMax Online Studios.</p>



<p>I’ve mentioned that this is a ‘claim’ because Boodhoo’s profile suggests he departed from ZeniMax Online Studios in 2016, just two years after The Elder Scrolls Online was released. On his profile, he writes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Interaction design and Information architecture for itemization of digital assets, working alongside Content and Business teams to drive $15M in monthly revenue for over 10 years.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s possible he’s still plugged into the ecosystem and just <strong>knows </strong>that’s how much the game has continued to make since being released a decade ago. He works now in a consultancy capacity but insists he’s still connected to The Elder Scrolls.</p>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is one of ZeniMax’s most successful games ever, and since being released ten years ago, it has succeeded at pulling in and holding the attention of millions of gamers worldwide. It’s still receiving sizeable expansions today, and with there still being more ground to cover across the game’s universe, it’ll likely remain online for several years to come.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-player-count-new-all-time-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-player-count-has-reached-a-new-all-time-high-record.988590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-player-count-new-all-time-high/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Steam continues to pull in millions of gamers, firming up its position as the premier digital storefront on PC. Hours ago, the platform hit a new all-time high player count record, with 38,367,277 users being active on the platform concurrently. Steam’s popularity is increasing exponentially – in 2020, peaks were sitting at around 18 million users.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-lot-of-gaming">That’s a Lot of Gaming</h2>



<p>Out of those 38 million users, around 12 million were actively playing a game when the new record was secured. In recent weeks, <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=24h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a few titles</a> have contributed massively to this growth on the platform.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ve got Counter-Strike 2, which remains Valve’s most-played game ever, sitting with a 24-hour peak of 1,459,492 players. Behind that ranks games like PUBG (787,340 peak), Dota 2 (731,193 peak), Black Myth: Wukong (533,128 peak), and Naraka: Bladepoint (298,908 peak).</p>



<p>In fifth place rests ‘Banana’, the strange, money-printing game that stormed up the charts earlier this year when users found they could potentially make hundreds of dollars simply by clicking a banana. It has been permeated by bot activity so that the active player count is inflated.</p>



<p>For shame.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, more games than ever are being played on Steam – and more are being <strong>released</strong>. </p>



<p>By way of a comparison, I’ll point out that in 2020, 9,699 gamers were released on Steam. In 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that number hit 14,422</a>, another all-time high for the platform. In 2006 – which is as far back as records go – just 71 games were released on Steam. From the single-dev indie games to the AAA titles, everything is finding a home on Steam.</p>



<p>In January 2024, it was estimated that more than 73,000 unique games were available on Steam, and that’s without mentioning the scores of DLC, expansions, and additional content. It is single-handedly holding up the bulk of the PC-based gaming market on its shoulders, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it surpasses 40 million concurrent users very soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/linkin-park-lol-worlds-anthem/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/linkin-park%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98heavy-is-the-crown%E2%80%99-is-this-year%E2%80%99s-lol-worlds-anthem.988587/</guid>

<p>Riot Games has confirmed that Linkin Park’s new track, Heavy is the Crown, is this year’s League of Legends World Championship anthem. This was all but known in recent weeks when several clues surfaced online pointing to the track – one of the first new songs from the group in several years – being this year’s LoL Worlds anthem.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-year-another-banger">Another Year, Another Banger</h2>



<p>The League of Legends Worlds anthem is typically a profile track that garners hundreds of millions of listens online. In recent years, some of the biggest artists in the world have lent their talents and profile to the League of Legends World Championship. Most recently, NewJeans provided the anthem.</p>



<p>Heavy is the Crown is one of Linkin Park’s newest tracks, taken from the group’s first new album in years – ‘From Zero’.</p>



<p>Recently, Linkin Park revealed a new lead singer in the form of Emily Armstrong, who has stepped in to provide vocal talents following the tragic passing of Chester Bennington in 2017.</p>



<p>Heavy is the Crown, which is expected to be one of the best LoL Worlds anthems in years, will premiere on YouTube tomorrow, September 24:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This year’s Championship will unravel in the O2 Arena in London, England. Between September 25 and November 2, the world’s greatest League of Legends teams will descend on the venue seeking their chance at winning the $445,000 grand prize. It’s one of the biggest events in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-events-calendar-2024/">the esports calendar</a>, and last year’s event broke global viewership records.</p>



<p>League of Legends remains one of the ‘Big Three’ esports titles, sitting at the top of the table alongside Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. It’s a monumental title that continues to spearhead the growth of the industry, and the League of Legends World Championship 2024 shouldn’t be missed, even if you’re not a huge fan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-30th-anniversary-prices/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A leaker has revealed some of the prices for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-playstation-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 30th anniversary collection</a>, which includes the limited edition PS5 slim and DualSense controller.</p>



<p>The information comes from reputable dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-les-prix-de-quelques-references-des-editions-limitees-du-30eme-anniversaire-playstation-59567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (via dealabs), who has revealed the prices for the PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) console bundle and the DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller. According to the leaker, the prices are as follows:</p>



<p><strong>PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) console bundle</strong> – <strong>$499.99 USD</strong> (rumored to cost €519.99 and £449.99)<br><strong>DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller</strong> – <strong>$79.99 USD</strong> (rumored to cost €79.99 and £69.99)</p>



<p>As rightfully pointed out by the community, the prices don’t appear to be as high as expected and while this information is nearly leaks at this stage and should be taken with a pinch of salt, the leaker does obtain his information from the backend of website stores, so it’s almost certain accurate.</p>



<p>While the dataminer couldn’t find any information on the other limited edition items, including the hotly anticipated PS5 Pro console bundle and PlayStation Portal, the prices of the two items suggest that they won’t be as high as people were hoping. However, it should be stressed that the 30th anniversary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a> console bundle, which will include a PlayStation 5 Pro (already retails for $699), DualSense&nbsp;Edge wireless controller, and more will almost certainly be over the $1000. Hopefully, us UK and European folk won’t get burned to hard on the conversation rates there (wishful thinking, I know).</p>



<p>What do you think of the prices so far on the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Edition PlayStation 5 and wireless controller? Did you expect them to be higher? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-preview-a-delicious-delight.988404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview-delicious-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frolicking through the Shire used to be a dream, but <em>Tales of the Shire</em> brings those dreams to reality. With an adorable art style, a world that feels alive, and excellent cooking mechanics, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is shaping up to be everything cozy <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fans were hoping for.</p>
<p>I was able to preview <em>Tales of the Shire</em> for 90 minutes earlier this week, and it was better than I could’ve hoped. The story follows a Hobbit moving from Bree to the Shire. Some Hobbits aren’t big on change, and the player will need to win everyone over and help build the Shire up. And what better way to get Hobbits to warm up to someone than by sharing a meal?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-gandalf.jpg?itok=I4wR2XeP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-gandalf.jpg?itok=OhczKYdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The introduction in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is everything a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>fan could want.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a ton of things to do, like farming, foraging, helping other Hobbits, and – of course – cooking. Cooking and sharing meals is a staple in the life of a Hobbit (after all, who can forget about Second Breakfast).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=-90uNJz9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=LhvXt9du 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cooking isn't as simple as it is in most other games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cooking is actually fun in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>Preview</h2>
<p>Preparing meals has a few different components to it that make it complex enough to keep your attention. Texture plays a big part in meals, along with flavor, just like in real life. Players have to choose the best ingredients possible while also cutting and cooking things just right to get the best texture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was much more interactive than I was expecting, and it fit perfectly in for a game centered around cooking. The act of sharing meals was also more complex – the Hobbits all have specific things they like, and it’s not as easy to figure out as most would expect.</p>
<p>Everything centered around the home was incredible, including home design. I enjoy decorating in games, but it generally feels a bit stiff. However, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> had a delightful decorating system, and the decorations were so cute that I spent a bit too much time in it for the 90-minute preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t regret it, though – between the cooking and home decorations, it’s my definition of cozy to the max.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hobson-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=6PChEK1x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hobson-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=AOpcs2Re 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hobbits in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>are full of life and expression.​​​​​</figcaption></figure><h2>The other great things to do in <em>Tales of the Shire</em></h2>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you want to spend all your time inside. Between exploring, helping other Hobbits, fishing, and collecting ingredients, there’s not a lack of things to do outside the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is gorgeous. When the first looks at <em>Tales of the Shire</em> were released, people were skeptical about the art style. However, it works beautifully in-game. The world is dazzling, and little details are scattered everywhere that make it feel full of life. What better way to represent the Shire?</p>
<p>The music is also what you’d expect in a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game. The soundtrack was calming and charming, and it matched the vibes of the Shire perfectly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bridge-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=o0J_oomZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bridge-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=j3Twh82n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Shire is so full of beautiful details.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tales of the Shire</em> had a few small problems</h2>
<p>There were a few bumps in terms of gameplay. The guiding system is really clever and uses birds to help guide players to objectives. However, it never seemed to work right. Birds would appear after I’d go down the correct path, so they weren’t really helpful for leading. There was also a moment when the game just stopped working.</p>
<p>However, the game is six months away from release. I’d be amazed if I ran into no hiccups in 90 minutes of playtime.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>All in all, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is one of 2025’s most anticipated cozy games</h2>
<p>The first 90 minutes of <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is more than I could’ve dared hope for. The small issues I encountered didn’t drag the game down. I’m very excited to see how the game continues to improve, and how it progresses in terms of complexity when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed">releases early next year</a>.</p>
