		<p>Konami has announced that it will be hosting a stream on Thursday June 12th, called Konami Press Start, which will be air at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM BST/ 3:00 PM CEST. Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be present during the showcase, plus other announcements.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Konami are being pretty specific with the timing, stating the stream will last 37 minutes. So, we have two games confirmed for the showcase but they probably won’t take up the entire runtime. It is likely there will be some update regarding eFootball, possibly around the Club World Cup, since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/fifa-and-konami-sign-partnership-deal/">FIFA and Konami signed a partnership deal</a> back in October. That still leaves a vast library of IPs that Konami can draw on. People will likely be hoping for mention of a new Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid Collection Vol.2, mention of more Yu-Gi-Oh, and Bomberman. Maybe we’ll see some very dormant IPs turn up too like Zone of the Enders or Bloody Roar. It is likely the company will show something completely new too.</p>
<p>We will know exactly what Konami has up its sleeve in just a few days time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/apple-consolidates-ios-gaming-features-in-new-games-app/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>At its Worldwide Developer Conference today, Apple unveiled a new iOS Games App that Apple Senior Director of Marketplace Platforms and Technologies Ann Thai promoted as "a new destination to help you get more out of your games."</p>
<p>The most relevant new social feature in the app comes in the "Play Together" tab, which provides a quick look at what your friends are playing on iOS. That tab will also integrate a new Challenges feature, which game developers can use to turn single-player games into score-based competitions between friends. These interpersonal Challenges come on top of the standard game leaderboards already common through iOS's Game Center, allowing for a new way to compete socially.</p>
<p>Other than that, the new Games app seems to consolidate several features that were previously split between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/gaming-on-apple-platforms-is-set-for-some-big-changes-here-are-a-few/">Game Center</a> and the App Store. On the Home tab, the Games app will let you see games with new update, time-sensitive in-game events, and recommendations for new games to try. A Library tab will show every iOS game you've ever downloaded in a single place, while the Apple Arcade tab shows subscribers what's available to download. The Games app will work in both portrait and landscape mode and be navigable via controller.</p>

                <p>Loyal fans of one of Bethesda's recent original blockbusters are losing hope that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> won't see any new content soon. Players have been voicing their concerns about the future of Starfield after the game was absent from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Showcase.</a></p><p>“What a complete disappointment,” said Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6izi4/what_a_complete_disappointment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">totallynormalpersonz</a>, who was originally included in a report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. “What a joke the only thing we ever hear from Bethesda about this game nowadays is stuff off the Creation Club. The Xbox showcase would have been the perfect time to show off something new for this game. Unfortunately Bethesda doesn't seem to care. Wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda has abandoned this game and are hoping the community will make content for them. This does not bode well for future Bethesda game studio projects.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield Is Going Through An Identity Crisis</p>
      </div>
<p>The lack of an update for Starfield was particularly annoying for fans as other Bethesda titles were front and center during the Xbox Showcase. Both The Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 received their share of attention with new content, seasonal updates, and even some new fishing features. Bethesda had previously promised an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">"exciting" year</a> for Starfield.</p><p>Starfield most recently received an <a href="https://bethesda.net/ko/game/starfield/article/3eFYYUUqzOpOSv086XWMh9/starfield-update-notes-may" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> last month in May, although it primarily focused on bug fixes and stability improvements. Players have created an extensive amount of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-starfield-mods/2900-6529/" data-ref-id="2900-6529">Starfield mods</a> that have become popular in the community.</p><p>Bethesda's space epic received mixed reviews when it launched in 2023. Many critics and fans recognized that it didn't provide the sense of awe that an adventure through space should provide. They hoped that later DLCs and player-made content would eventually provide the experience they were looking for, but that hope hasn't been realized.</p><p>"It struggles to deliver a cohesive and memorable RPG experience amid the seemingly boundless sea of stars," wrote Michael Higham in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">GameSpot Starfield review</a>. "For all its reverence for scientific philosophy, its stories and characters paint a rather tame and sterile vision for what our spacefaring future could look like."</p>

Time has sped by unfathomably quickly, and I wasn't sure whether a performance boost and an additional mobile app would be enough to let the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition get its hooks in me to quite the same extent as its predecessor did back in 2023.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I couldn't call myself a true Zelda fan if I didn't at least have a gander at this new package. I started a new save file (because that's an option now), blinked, and suddenly realised that five hours had passed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> might be one of the harder titles to get your tongue around, but falling back into this sublime sequel was as easy as pie. Those diving into the adventure for the first time can rest easy knowing that they're getting the game in its mightiest form; those who have already poured hundreds of hours into Link's latest can feel safe in the knowledge that a performance boost and mobile extras are well worth making the return journey, even if a little of the magic is lost along the way.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156697/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm sure that you already have a decent grasp of TOTK's story and features, so I won't waste any time on a recap here (and I recommend reading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">our Switch 1 review</a> first if you've never played the game). Rest assured, the performance boost hasn't taken anything away from the game's scope. This Hyrule is still massive and full to the brim with quest-giving NPCs, attention-snatching points of interest, and, yes, <em>ya-haha</em>-ing Koroks.</p>
<p>The difference is that all of this feels a little more manageable now. I'll get to the game's stunning facelift in just a moment, but I'd like to briefly highlight Zelda Notes first.</p>
<p>This optional mobile add-on has levelled its fair share of criticism (even we Nintendo Life writers are split on it). The audio guidance voice is painfully grating and as repetitive as they come — on that we can all agree — while the very principle of an external guide dictating your every move isn't great for the immersion levels. For <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and its tighter world, I, too, would be more hesitant about the Zelda Notes inclusion. But returning to my old save file on TOTK, and the *checks notes* <em>66% of the game</em> I still hadn't completed after wrapping up the story, it felt like a welcome bonus.</p>

<p>One of TOTK's greatest strengths is its near-endless sense of wonder — you'll never spend too much time on one objective before being distracted by 12 others — but, particularly in the late game, it can start to feel like a little <em>too much</em>. I, for example, adore the Addison side quests, where you have to assist a nervous little Hylian on his sign-balancing missions. I'd like to complete more of them, and the Zelda Notes addition can help me to do that.</p>
<p>In recent days, I've hopped on for a few minutes to tick off a couple of Koroks, beat a Shrine, or listen to the new fully-voiced Voice Memories from Zelda, Rauru, and Master Kohga — inessential bits of 'lore' but perfectly harmless. You <em>can</em> still play without the app, and let TOTK throw every distraction it can muster your way (and you totally should), but taken as an extra that will be used predominantly by people who have already seen the adventure to the end, its inclusion makes Hyrule that bit less intimidating.</p>
<p>But let's not get bogged down in bonuses. TOTK - NS2 Ed.'s greatest strength is still the base game, and good heavens, is that game an utter joy to play with this boosted performance.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156696/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch 1, this was a marvel. This is a game where you can combine any two objects to create something new, swim through mountains to quickly reach higher ground, and approach combat encounters in any way imaginable — mechs, meat shields, you name it. The Switch could do all of this without instantly bursting into flames (like I say, <em>a marvel!</em>), but it wasn't without its technical hiccups. Taking a stroll through the Korok Forest would still tank the frame rate, things would get crunchy when trying to manoeuvre a large build, etc.</p>
<p>Expectedly, all of this is a thing of the past this time around. From my experience, the game runs at a buttery smooth 60fps all the time. And I mean <em>all</em> the time. I've sprinted through the Korok Forest without so much as a stutter, dived from Sky Island to depths with no slowdown, and fast-travelled with the most minimal of load screens. No matter what I threw at it, the Switch 2 kept things steady.</p>
<p>And I cannot emphasise enough just how pretty everything looks when running without restraint. Be it in the wind flowing through Link's hair or the glowing energy of a cowering Zonai construct, playing with such buttery smoothness means you will not want to go back to the original in a hurry. Believe me, I tried.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156693/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The resolution boost has worked wonders for the world, too. Textures are much more defined, even from afar, and the improved draw distance makes it easier than ever to scout out a ground-level locale from a faraway Sky Island.</p>
<p>It's true that the 4K goodness (in docked mode) highlights a handful of visual blemishes that I don't remember catching my eye in the original — have those mountains always looked so... grainy? — but without a complete overhaul of the art, this was bound to happen. And let's be clear, I'm nitpicking <em>small</em> blemishes here. It looks stunning overall.</p>
<p>If there is one thing to keep in mind before diving back into Tears, it's that your playthrough is unlikely to be quite as magical as it was the first time around. The game is still packed with beauty but, outside of Zelda Notes, there's nothing <em>new</em> here. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> will pack in bonus challenges on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a> is getting new rulesets, but TOTK has been left as it is.</p>

<p>Sure, £7.99 / $10.99 is a small price to pay to see the visual and performance upgrade in action (even smaller to those with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, who get it for 'free'), but don't expect to come back and feel the magic in <em>quite</em> the same way as you might with an additional Master Mode or Side Quest.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When all's said and done, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is a fantastic revamp of perhaps Nintendo's most sublime sequel. What was once a technical marvel on aged hardware now has a chance to truly shine, with visual and performance boosts undoubtedly making it the definitive way to play.</p>
<p>Nothing will ever match the feeling of playing it for the first time, of course, and some bonus content would have been welcome, but armed with Zelda Notes and the promise of buttery smooth upgrades, I'd challenge anyone to dip back in without losing <em>hours</em> to its unrivalled wonder.</p></section>

In a newly released trailer, we not only get to see Riri Williams’ latest suit, but we also see her unique take on an Iron Man favorite.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The show’s first trailer laid out almost everything we needed to know about the upcoming season. We saw Williams (Dominique Thorne) proving her genius to Parker “The Hood” Robbins (Anthony Ramos) in a life-threatening test, we heard her coyly describe her time in Wakanda during <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> as “an internship abroad,” and we also got a look at some of the cool suits she’ll be piloting. This new trailer is shorter but reveals two major additions: a magic-infused suit and her own spin on Tony Stark’s J.A.R.V.I.S.</p><p>After hearing Williams say she needs to think outside the box, we see a crimson-colored explosion of the same magical sigils we’ve seen sorcerers like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) wield. We later get a glimpse of someone actually drawing those symbols and of Williams inside a suit that gets ensconced in those sigils. We don’t know yet who introduces her to this magic, but I’m praying to the MCU gods that somehow Wanda makes a surprise return to give our new iron-clad hero a lesson in multiversal magic.</p><p>Another cool part of the trailer is Williams building her own version of J.A.R.V.I.S. in the likeness of her best friend, played by <em>This Is Us</em> actress Lyric Ross. Since Ross’s character is memorialized in a mural with Williams’s late father, it’s safe to assume she’s dead and that this is Williams’s way of keeping her memory alive, whether she did so consciously or subconsciously. In the comics, Ross’s character is named Natalie, and her AI counterpart is dubbed N.A.T.A.L.I.E. This, and the profound quote from Williams’s father about taking something apart to really know what it’s made of, provides <em>Ironheart</em> the emotional core that gives its fantastical action human stakes.</p><p><em>Ironheart</em> will have a three-episode world premiere on June 24 at 6 p.m. PT / 9 p.m. ET on Disney+.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</section></header><section>

<p>We were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> make an appearance at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct back in April, and now Square Enix has drip-fed us a <em>little</em> more information about when we can expect to see it come our way.</p>
<p>At last night's Xbox Games Showcase, the studio revealed that the remake will be arriving on Switch 2 (and Xbox, obvs) at some point <strong>this Winter</strong>. It's far from a precise release date — heck, even a month would have been nice — but at least it's something.</p>
<p>For those who missed the initial announcement, Intergrade is billed as a "visually enhanced edition" of the ace 2020 title, which was itself a remake of the classic PS1 RPG. It's all a little confusing, but expect plenty of action, melodrama, glossy hair, and some of the biggest swords going.</p>
<p>This version also packs in the 'FF7R EPISODE INTERmission' storyline, which sees you play as ninja Yuffie Kisaragi on her mission to infiltrate Midgar's Shinra Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>All in all, we're rather excited to see what this one has to offer on Switch 2 this winter. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> seemed pretty up on Intergrade when it first arrived on PS5 back in 2021, calling it "a game of ups and downs in terms of quality, but by the time the credits roll, its most memorable moments shine through — of which there are many" in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">review</a>.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft wasn't a part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> in the traditional way, with its own<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/"> Ubisoft Forward</a> presentation taking place at some point within the already jam-packed weekend, but it did appear in some SGF 2025 events with a couple of release date announcements and the reveal of a brand new game.</p>
<p>Starting with the release date reveal, we now know that Anno 117: Pax Romana will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 13, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The new release date trailer for Anno 117 showed off a bit more gameplay and plenty of glamor shots of the game, though if you want a dedicated gameplay deep-dive, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-gets-first-gameplay-showcase/">can check out the previous trailer Ubisoft showed off.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6a37J87bew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was The Rogue Prince of Persia, a 2D-platforming Prince of Persia game from Evil Empire that released in early access last year. Unfortunately, we didn't get an exact release date, but we did get a release window for the 1.0 update, which is due to arrive sometime in <strong>August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the game has evolved since its early access release, which was already a strong foundation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo regarded its early access launch highly, writing</a>, "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="PC Gaming Show Trailer - The Rogue Prince of Persia" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9c1QFum8GXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Ubisoft revealed a new title it is publishing from developer Screen Juice, called Morbid Metal. It's a new hack-and-slash roguelite with semi-procedurally generated levels, set in what appears to be some kind of dystopian future. It's due to arrive on PC in early access on&nbsp;<strong>August 20, 2025,</strong> and will feature three playable characters at launch that'll each have their own unique playstyles.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">demo you can play on Steam right now</a>, if you're keen to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid Metal - Gameplay Trailer - PC Gaming Show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL9ArylnvzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>None of these were exactly the announcements players had expected from Ubisoft during the Summer Game Fest weekend. There was nothing about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">Splinter Cell,</a> or any of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">Assassin's Creed</a> games currently in development. There wasn't even a last-ditch push for <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, the biggest change to Siege in the game's history, which launches tomorrow at the time of this writing. There was also no mention of what's next for <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry</a>, or the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>With 2025 officially lacking a Ubisoft Forward event, it's unlikely we'll hear about any of those titles and series the rest of the year, unless the company decides to drop news for its biggest franchises in a third-party show like Gamescom ONL or The Game Awards. The company is going through <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">several major changes</a>, so it's not surprising that it doesn't have very much to showcase at the moment, but a muted 2025 does not bode well for the company after its extremely disappointing 2024.</p>

Reaching this area will only take a quick bit of platforming.</p><p>You’ll first want to climb up the side of the giant skeleton that envelops the Grand Hub. From the entrance, run over the wooden bridge to the right and up the dirt path. On your left and next to a torch will be a wall of vines you can climb to reach the top of some uncomfortably large bones. Once you’re at the top, run to the right and use the tip of the bone as a ramped jumping off point. There is no consequence for missing the elevated platform we’re shooting for, although aiming more towards the right can help if you keep missing.</p><p>Head left and jump across the chasm in front of the waterfall. Keep moving forward and you’ll come across a second waterfall. The mountainside gives in a little bit to reveal a narrow pathway that runs right behind it. Jump down and turn into the small alcove to find a small flock of downy crakes and their far larger parent.</p><h2 id="h543188"><a id="2"></a>How to Earn More Nest Trinkets</h2><figure id="" data-id="9c5e9264e51d894ce66b42db729a8bec" data-recommend-id="image://9c5e9264e51d894ce66b42db729a8bec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter receives four different items after gathering a Nest Trinket in front of the Gigacrake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter receives four different items after gathering a Nest Trinket in front of the Gigacrake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c5e9264e51d894ce66b42db729a8bec" data-recommend-id="image://9c5e9264e51d894ce66b42db729a8bec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter receives four different items after gathering a Nest Trinket in front of the Gigacrake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your incentive for finding this massively fluffy bird isn’t just to take some funny screenshots.

However, whether I stayed exclusively in the Grand Hub or spent the time grinding out some Arena Quests, this only provided me with a single item. <strong>Going on back-to-back hunts would make Nest Trinkets respawn faster and provide more items.</strong> This functions similarly to the Cohoot Nests in <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>.

                <p>Look, I get it. You're 200 hours into the build of your life when suddenly a Phantom drops from the sky, knocking you from your Happy Ghast, plunging you to a certain death. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> is no joke--all that XP gone just because you hyper-focused on your new castle and forgot to sleep for a few nights. That's where Minecraft cheats and console commands can come in handy, if you just want a little more help without flipping between the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-minecraft-game-modes-and-difficulty-settings-explained/1100-6531283/" data-ref-id="1100-6531283">Minecraft game modes</a> to turn Creative mode on and off. We've got all the console commands your heart desires right here.</p><h2>How to use cheats and console commands</h2><p>Console commands, or cheats, are text commands you can enter into the in-game chat box to enable or disable certain features in Minecraft. While they're usually mostly used by developers during the creation of the game to test certain elements, they can be retained for use by players after the game releases.</p><p>Before you can choose the best cheat for your situation, you'll need to know how to use them. The process is slightly different for Java vs. Bedrock, and differs further depending on whether you're playing on a private world, a Realm, or a multiplayer server. If you're the owner of the world, Realm, or server, you can just head to the options menu and ensure console commands are turned on. If you don't own it, it's down to the person that does to decide whether they want to allow console commands.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2644257-14937119970_efd7e9e87c_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2644257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2644257-14937119970_efd7e9e87c_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2644257"></a><figcaption>Building impressive structures can be easier with cheats.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2644257-14937119970_efd7e9e87c_h.jpg"></figure><p>Occasionally, some console commands will be activated and others will require certain permissions.

            <p>
Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream - the stealth adventure that's been eliciting all sorts of oohs and ahhs thanks to its lovely looks and impressive motion capture - finally has a release date. It's coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 15th July, with a demo available now.
</p>
<p>
Eriksholm is the work of River End Games, a Swedish studio comprised of around 16 people (making its presentational pizzaz all the more impressive), and it takes its inspiration from the Scandinavia of the early 1900s. This isn't quite the world as we know it - a mysterious illness known as Heartpox has the city in its grip, for starters - but it's here we meet our protagonist, Hanna, who becomes embroiled in a deadly adventure after her brother disappears.
</p>
<p>
River End Games calls Eriksholm an "isometric, narrative-driven stealth game", and it shares many of the trappings of the stealth-tactics genre - including sight cones, that isometric perspective, and multiple characters with complementary abilities you'll use to navigate the city undetected. Based on my time with a couple of levels not so long ago, though, it <em>appears</em> to lean more puzzle-y than sandbox-y, with obstacles having specific solutions.

<p>
 It's unclear if that's indicative of the broader experience, but I'm certainly intrigued enough to want to play more. Not least because Eriksholm - with its endearing cast and gorgeous environmental design - is a lovely world to sink into.
 </p>
<p>
And River End Games is now letting everyone have a nose around Eriksholm ahead of its launch, thanks to a newly released demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9">Epic Games Store</a>. River End hasn't specified what's in the demo, but it's promising a glimpse of Eriksholm's "atmospheric design, tense stealth sequences, and emotionally driven narrative". And you'll be able to carry your progress over to the full game if you're suitably convinced.
</p>
<p>
Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 15th July, and (depending on platform) it should cost around £33.50 GBP/€39.99/$39.99 USD.

                <p>Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has spoken up to assure people that the Switch 2 should be in stock through the holiday. Appearing on CBS Mornings, Bowser said Nintendo has a "steady supply of manufacturing" for the Switch 2 that should continue to make its way to retailers.</p><p>"We believe we'll be able to meet that demand all the way through the summer... and on into the holiday period," Bowser said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xHJ1SlyDys" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3xHJ1SlyDys" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Switch 2's initial preorders sold through, and the console is still not in regular supply for anyone who wants one. You can consult GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 buying guide</a> to help secure a console for yourself.</p><h2><strong>"Fluid and complex situation"</strong></h2><p>Also in the interview, Bowser addressed the ongoing tariff situation and how it impacts the Switch 2. The executive clarified that Switch 2 consoles for the US are primarily manufactured in the US, while Nintendo also makes Switch 2 consoles in China and Cambodia for other parts of the world.</p><p>Bowser acknowledged that it's a "fluid and complex situation" as it relates to tariffs. And while Nintendo did not raise prices on the Switch 2 console, it did raise prices on some accessories due to tariffs. Looking ahead, Bowser said Nintendo is "looking at various scenarios" to help ensure the Switch 2 can stay at $450 for the base model and $500 for the Mario Kart 2 bundle.</p><p>US President Donald Trump announced a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/xi-visit-vietnam-china-us-trade-d7046613bff2c9ef31162ae8dd436263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">46% tariff on products from Vietnam</a>, but it was paused and is now not expected to go into effect until July. Specifically, the pause is in effect until July 9. A 46% tariff rate is significant, but it's unclear how Nintendo would react if tariffs at that level are implemented.</p>

<figure><a title="nms mp issues" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/511d39d642ab6/nms-mp-issues.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, the big new Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade of Hello Games' ever-evolving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> is now in the wild, and it's certainly looking like a much slicker, smoother experience on Nintendo's powered-up platform. Indeed, we're planning a full review in due course, so sit tight on that while we work our way through the launch games.</p>
<p>However! It appears all is not well with this new version of the game. We guess bugs are to be expected with titles of this size on platforms this new, though this is quite a biggie. Indeed, as of right now, the multiplayer aspect of the game, which includes playing online with pals, as well as being tied to other in-game discovery elements, seems to be completely broken.</p>
<figure><a title="nms mp issues" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac064ccdbaa0a/nms-mp-issues.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After seeing reports online, we jumped in and ran into the issue ourselves, with our game telling us that it has no connection to any matchmaking services, as shown in our pic above. As it turns out, it's been a whole thing since the game dropped a few days ago, with players taking to various forums and social media to voice their concerns having run into the exact same issue.</p>


<p>The woes continue, too, as it seems cross-saves are also causing issues, although this one is easier to explain, as it's due to various platforms running on different numbered versions of the game. So, we'll need to wait for the Switch 2 version to be brought in line, it seems, to fix that one.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Hello Games about the issues, and will update you as soon as we hear anything. We do reckon they'll be getting this snafu sorted fairly quick-smart, though, given it's quite a serious one.</p>

While he wasn't a core part of <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bccf8de0-f24d-4021-9f80-f175dae84092" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dying-light-2-stay-human-review" rel="nofollow">Dying Light 2</a>'s</em> story, only being mentioned by name, he's back again in <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>a smaller adventure set after the events of <em>Dying Light 2 </em>that pick up with Crane looking to find and get revenge on the Baron for what he got put through.</p>

<h2>Catching Up With Kyle Crane</h2>

<p>Since we last saw Kyle Crane, more has been understood about how he's simultaneously infected but also able to retain his humanity. He spent time offscreen trapped by The Baron, and now that he has been able to get out, he's wanting revenge. While we don't know much about what The Baron put Crane through, we know that he was experimenting on him for thirteen years.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to sit down and get my hands on an hour of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. This gameplay demo gave me a chance to explore the open world, make a safe house, hide from volatiles in the dark, take on an armed militia, and lastly take on a massive Chimera creature.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-kyle-crane.jpg?itok=hCcc7lsJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-kyle-crane.jpg?itok=PkP3xN9h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast's </em>Open World And Events</h2>

<p>Sitting down with Aaron Telty, QA Analyst at Techland, I loaded into the world. Immediately, I was hit with just how gorgeous <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>looks. Starting in a courtyard of derelict buildings with an afternoon sun shining warm orange light across the world… I was immediately beset by zombies.</p>

<p>After getting familiar with the controls, I headed out into the world. Much like previous <em>Dying Light </em>titles the world of <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>is a parkour playground. I was hopping from light post to dangling rope, through a building (doing a bit of looting along the way), and launching off zombies to attain higher ground.</p>

<p>Starting with just a crowbar, it wasn't too long (with the assistance of a guiding QA hand) that I stumbled upon an Axe lodged into a poor human in the back of a truck. Swapping between weapons was an easy process and there was clear indications as to just how powerful everything was in comparison.</p>

<p>An interesting gameplay mechanic I learned early, when I horribly misjudged a jump and ended up staring at a game over screen, was that in <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>when you die you'll lost a portion of your gained experience for the level. While not a lot it's an interesting balance between stat progression, risking your time outside (especially at night), and wanting to progress in levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Improvements To <em>Dying Light 2 </em>That Have Carried Over<br>
An interesting aspect that kept coming up while playing <em>The Beast </em>was that since I last played <em>Dying Light 2 </em>at time of review and release there are a lot of systems including weapon, gore, and movement mechancs that have been improved over time that I didn't experience in 2, that I now could as part of The Beast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I continued my path to a safe house the sun began to set on the world. With that Volatiles, incredibly dangerous zombies began appearing. With a quick scan of the environment Crane is able to directly spot them, glowing with red skeletons in the night.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-volatile.jpg?itok=Lok-iYud 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-volatile.jpg?itok=CTRblccC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The world of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> radically shifts between day and night, it's more deadly turning it into a stealth title. Crouching down and switching off my flashlight I quietly navigated through tall grass to reach the safe house. It was reinforced that the stage of the game I was playing it was definitely more important to remain stealthed but that later on in the game, after leveling up and unlocking additional abilities you'd be able to hold your own much better in the night sections.</p>

<h2>Playing Your Way</h2>

<p>A key theme of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was how it's up to the player to decide how they want to approach each new obstacle in the game. I got to see this a number of times. Initially, it was in securing the safe house. Descending into the basement to return power to the small apartment I snuck through a room of unconscious zombies. There were at least a dozen in this small room.</p>

<p>Creeping around I was able to obtain a fuse and power up the generator, waking the zombies in the process. Knowing I had limited durability on my weapons, and I wasn't likely going to get much out of killing the zombies in this room I simply left, jumping back into the vent I had entered the room in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=28Ba4wjl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=5-WTLU3I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This kind of difference in approach came up again shortly after, reaching a facility that was being guarded by a small militia. Ascending to the roof it was recommended that I approach this with stealth where I can… unfortunately I was already charging forward and had prepared to dropkick the nearest guard clean off the roof.</p>

<p>With a variety of quiet and loud combat options, stealth sections, and even open world driving I was impressed with just how quickly you might have one plan, that immediately becomes something else.</p>

<h2>Unleash The Beast</h2>

<p>A unique gameplay aspect of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is in Kyle Crane's infected genetics. As you deal and take melee damage you'll be slowly increasing a rage meter in the lower left of your screen.</p>

<p>Once that meter has reached it's peak you can click in with both thumbsticks to tap into a more menacing kind of combat. Putting away his weapons Crane bares his fists to grab, smack, punch, and even tear off zombies limbs as he goes fully feral.</p>

<p>While in this mode I also seemed to notice that Crane ran faster, possible a good ability to have in your back pocket in case a situation is about to go sideways.</p>

<h2>Investigate The World As Kyle Crane</h2>

<p>Another neat aspect of the demo experience (after I dropkicked way too many guards off roofs) was entering a facility where I needed to do some sleuthing. Standing next to a cage that something had broken out of, interesting machinery, and suspicious piping Crane was able to analyse each to get an idea of what creature had been contained, a Chimera, and what he could do to lure it back and kill it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-interior.jpg?itok=EzUV1AxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-interior.jpg?itok=5Bi85aCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Entering another zombie infested area and obtaining a flamethrower I then got gas to attract the Chimera and engaged in a massive battle. This creature, at least 12 feet tall even with a hunched over stance, was a beast that while humanoid in shape had clearly been stretched to the limits of it's form.</p>

<p>The Chimera, with exposed muscle tendons glistening in the light crashed through a car yard. This boss battle was hard, and not just in the way that I was rusty with the controls, but that where Crane was in the story just two attacks connecting from this creature would put me in the dust.</p>

<p>Through (alot) of trial and error I was able to coordinate dodging shockwave attacks, rocks getting hurled at me, and sliding out of the way of a charging attack defeating him. For Crane upgrades to movement and attacks are through natural experience and progressions, but it's only in defeating the Chimera and possibly other advanced infected that Crane is able to level up his infected abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-chimera.jpg?itok=3kS_tuqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-chimera.jpg?itok=WTpYsPXQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A More Linear Experience</h2>

<p>Unlike <em>Dying Light </em>and <em>Dying Light 2</em> the experience for The Beast is more linear. This is in essence part of how the game came about, initially as DLC for Dying Light 2 before getting spun off. It's total runtime will also be shorter, but will still likely be around the 20 hours space.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Dying Light </em>there's really no reason to not be looking forward to <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. It's not only an evolution on the basic formula but with a more linear approach to the narrative there is a lot more chance to really get invested in the world and it's characters.</p>

<p><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>releases this year on August 22nd</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I walked out of my Summer Game Fest 2025 demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mixtape/" data-ref-id="5000-631968">Mixtape</a> beaming like an idiot, a smile stuck on my face. I can't think of a game that has ever vibed as hard as Mixtape does. Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's debut, The Artful Escape, was a vibes game, too. Light on traditional gameplay mechanics and basically lacking any fail states, it instead leaned into aesthetics, mood, and tone. It was more of a feeling than a traditional game, but I loved it for that.</p><p dir="ltr">There are lots of vibes games, like Unpacking, Night in the Woods, and Firewatch, to name a few. I love a good vibes game, and Mixtape, the next game from the team behind The Artful Escape, feels like it could be the ultimate example. I played about 30 minutes of Mixtape and saw what you might call a few levels of the game, which plays like a '90s-set coming-of-age story but is meant to feel "sorta like channel-surfing [old-school] MTV at 3 AM," developer Johnny Galvatron told me.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TQF6eJa3Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Mixtape, you play a group of three high-school pals on the cusp of graduating and looking to make it to a party on the beach to cap off their childhood. The party is going to rule if they can just get there, and each figurative step toward that end goal is played out to a different song that collectively makes up one of the best licensed soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. Joy Division, The Cure, The Smashing Pumpkins, and many more bring so much life to this game. Something about the joining of gaming and music has always been incredibly powerful to me, and Mixtape's way of bringing these things together sincerely blew my mind.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not that the gameplay side of Mixtape is especially intricate. But it's always changing. The main mechanic seems like it'll be what you may have seen in the trailer: coasting downhill in a skateboard, dodging cars, flipping off cops, and stopping to sneak a couple of beers out of your house. But the game toys with not just this format--like a later level in which I led the police on a high-speed chase in a careening shopping cart--but also cleverly gamifies the group's friendship and experiences in other ways. I laughed out loud when I was hit with a French-kissing minigame, where each joystick controlled one tongue, and I was free to mash and swirl the tongues together in what is sure to become a viral moment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later scene, the teens were driving to a fast food restaurant and blasting music along the way, turning the moment into an interactive headbanging mechanic in which you'd move to the music and rock out with your buddies. There's no penalty for doing it poorly, and seemingly no demand you do it at all. Mixtape is largely on rails in a sense, in that it's paced to play out nearly the same no matter how much you toy with the world in these fleeting but emotionally impactful ways. For instance, you do need to French kiss for a bit, but even then, you can keep it going much longer if you want to, long after the prompt tells you "that's enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Mixtape is a hard game to describe. If you're not one to find music especially moving or important, you surely won't find the gameplay moments carry you through to having the same euphoric experience I and many others had at SGF--I've been hearing a lot of people call it their game of the show. However, if you're like me, and you have some mushy nostalgia for the '90s, a romantic view of bands like The Cure, and a willingness to let an experience be something quite unlike a traditional video game, you'll likely come to the same conclusion I have: Mixtape is transcendent.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Obviously, it's personal preference, but Nintendo GameCube has one of the most smile-inducing system startup sequences with its purple cubes rolling around to a catchy tune. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> owners can experience this delightful moment every time they open the GameCube app with one simple trick: holding the left stick in any direction.</p><p dir="ltr">The GameCube library is new to the Nintendo Classics collection with the introduction of Switch 2, though accessing it does require subscribing to the premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier ($50 annually for an individual, $80 for a family). As such, the regular bootup for the app just showcases the purple GameCube controller overlaid on a red background, similar to the Nintendo 64 or NES apps.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We must admit, when Atari announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> over the weekend, it took us a good couple of minutes to realise it was officially linked to the classic 2600 game <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>Watching the trailer, the overall look and feel of the game didn't really form any connections in our mind, but then the title came up and we thought <em>"heh, Adventure of Samsara from Atari, that's kinda like the original Adventure"</em>. Slumped in chairs after caning the Switch 2 for a few days, the penny finally dropped.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Adventure of Samsara is, according to Atari, a completely new game set in the world of Adventure. In other words, then, it's neither a sequel not a remake. It is, however, a metroidvania, kinda like what the company did with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yars_rising">Yars Rising</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by indie studio Ilex Games, Adventure of Samsara will see you traverse 10 unique biomes with gameplay reminiscent of classic Prince of Persia titles. And, of course, for those who recovered the Enchanted Chalice and perhaps discovered Warren Robinett's hidden room in the original 1980 game, there will be plenty of curious easter eggs to discover.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.</p>
<p>- <strong>Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.</p>
<p>- <strong>Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.</p>
<p>- <strong>Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.</p>
<p>- <strong>Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no date for Adventure of Samsara yet beyond the current 2025 window, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
