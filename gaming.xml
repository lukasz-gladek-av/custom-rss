            <p>I've never been a poetry guy, not because I don't like it, I've just never gone out of my way to read them over books or whatnot. The poems I've engaged with the most are those read out during wedding ceremonies, those that pop-up before the start of a horror game, or <a href="https://826dc.org/student-writing/the-tiger/">The Tiger</a> by 6-year old Nael that occasionally pops up as I'm doomscrolling. But thanks to the multiplayer web game "fridge poetry", where you drag words to create poems, I might become a day-to-day poem guy. Going off my first effort, I don't think many will appreciate my career switch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Head on over to <a href="https://playhtml.fun/fridge.html">this site</a> and it'll transport you to the web's fridge wall, complete with loads of magnets folks have already popped on there and arranged to create poetry. At the bottom right, you can generate your own words, too. All you have to do is drag a word around and plop it next to any others, rearranging existing poems or creating your own. And what's really nice is that you can see other people's cursors as they go about their business, before they disappear into the ether.</p>
<p>My first poem? I saw my opening, the moment I laid eyes on the fridge door: the night consumes <em>blank</em>. I saw the word "fortnite" hovering nearby. Smugly, I put the two together: the night consumes fortnite. I think of it as a sort of contemplation, let's say, on how Fortnite both consumes people's evenings and is also being consumed itself. Consumed by Disney and Lego and Ariana Grande - perhaps gleefully. The word "night" also sounds like "nite", which I thought was clever.</p>
<p>Someone immediately dashed my work, hopping in to unpick my poem before leaving (fair enough). So I left another poem later, simply entitled: rock, paper, shotgun. And just as I did so, someone else generated the word "frotnite" and positioned it above "fortnite" in what was a rather beautiful thing that happened in real time.</p>
<p>Other poems on the door at the time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>every raccoon is gay</li>
<li>meow! meowmeowmeow</li>
<li>Dismay@aol.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I really like that last one.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a> developers Respawn Entertainment have announced that poorly-received plans to overhaul the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a>'s Premium Battle Pass will be partially walked back. Most crucially, the new passes – set to launch alongside the upcoming Season 22 in August – will no longer be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-new-battle-pass-plans-promise-greater-rewards-but-for-more-of-your-real-world-money">sold exclusively for real-world cash</a>; as with previous BPs, players will still be able to buy them with accumulated in-game currency.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You’ve spoken, and we’ve listened", opens the statement on the official <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859">Apex Legends TwiXer</a>. "With the release of Season 22 we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins. We recognise that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better – that’s on us."</p>
<p>Several other changes will still go ahead, including the switch from one Premium Battle Pass per season to one smaller (yet still more reward-stuffed) PBP per half-season. Yet these were never the target of player ire, which has been laser-focused on that hard cash requirement since it was revealed by publishers EA a couple of weeks ago. In essence, this would have denied dedicated players the chance to earn future Premium Battle Passes for no additional cost, as each pass includes enough Apex Coins as levelling-up rewards to cover the cost of the next one.</p>
<p>Happily, that can now continue, as even these truncated half-season passes will dish out 1300 coins when completed – more than enough to chain together successive purchases. A wise change of course, then, even if it’s one that probably shouldn’t have been necessary in the first place. If you're curious, here's a full breakdown of each tier's price and goodies:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/apex-legends-content-przepustka.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Respawn Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>EA and Respawn aren’t entirely abandoning the cash-for-passes model, though, as in addition to the Premium Battle Pass, Season 22 will also introduce Ultimate and Ultimate+ Battle Pass tiers, each offering yet more rewards – and costing $10 / $20 respectively, with no Apex Coin option. While that means some will end up forking out <em>$40 per season </em>if they pick up both Ultimate+ passes – good lord, people, control your hat urges – I wouldn’t expect these to draw the same kind of rancor as the original set of changes. Beyond a couple of timed-exclusive skin variants, they’re only serving up some extra crafting materials and loot crates over the Premium tier, and are more of a genuinely optional upgrade that won’t leave Apex Coin buyers in the lurch.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Fallout: London, the fan-made game-sized mod for Fallout 4, will be released today. The mod's creators confirmed the release to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow">Inverse</a> - saying the date was now definite, "unless nuclear war happens".
</p>
<p>
Developed by Team Folon, the mod has been over five years in the making and transports the post-apocalyptic game to England's capital city, with a whole new story, environments, characters, factions, weapons, and gameplay elements.
</p>
<p>
Due to its size it won't be available on popular mod hosting sites, so is instead <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london">available on GOG</a> with a custom launcher.
</p>

<p>

Note, however, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">mod is currently not compatible with the next-gen version</a> of the game, so players will need the pre-patched version (1.10.163.0). For this reason, players on Steam will need to downgrade before installation. As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-will-work-with-fallout-4-on-gog-and-steam-but-not-epic">mod is not compatible with Epic</a> due to lack of rollback features.


</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-fallout-london-finally-gets-a-release-date">mod was originally set for release on April 23rd this year</a> (fittingly, St. George's Day), but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">release was delayed due to Bethesda's next-gen upgrade</a>.


</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has followed development of Fallout: London for some time. Most recently, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-cast-will-include-former-speaker-of-the-house-john-bercow">former Speaker of the House John Bercow would be lending his voice</a> to an AI robot, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-adds-baldurs-gate-3-actor-to-its-cast">Neil Newbon - voice of Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3 - is also in the cast</a>.


</p>
<p>
The release of the Fallout: London mod will likely be boosted by the popularity of Amazon's Fallout TV show. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks</a> and has just recently been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-series-realistic-graphics/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dragon Quest series is facing some unexpected challenges posed by more realistic graphics, according to the series' creator Yuji Horii.</p>
<p>Speaking with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/240722m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Denfaminicogamer</a>, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/dragon-quest-creator-talks-about-an-unexpected-challenge-the-series-is-facing-due-to-graphics-becoming-more-realistic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a>, the popular RPG series creator talked about some unexpected challenges for the franchise posed by more realistic graphics. As now character models have become more expressive and detailed, having a silent protagonist, or "symbolic protagonist," as Horii-san calls it, who allows players to be the main character of the story has become more difficult. With more realistic and detailed graphics, a character that just stands there will look like an idiot.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest series creator feels there is no easy way to address this, as making the character react to events would ruin immersion. This, according to Yuji Horii, will become even more of a challenge in the future, so the day that the series will feature a different sort of protagonist may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, things are remaining as they have always been. The next entry in the series, the long-anticipated Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake, will feature a silent protagonist and many of the features that have always defined the series. You can learn more about the remake launching later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grit-and-valor-1949">Grit And Valor 1949</a> certainly evokes the tactics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into The Breach</a>, with its stompy machinery and floating tile battlegrounds. But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.</p>

<p>Set in an alternate World War II, in which Europe has been destroyed by officious enemy commanders aggressively wielding grandiloquent moustaches, Grit And Valor 1949 has you play as an allied resistance force campaigning to plant a very large EMP in the Axis base. Set the device, and reduce all their scary mechs to so many spent disposable vapes and Apple products that have passed their preprogrammed obsolescence counter. It’s got some mid-mission rogue-y bits where you’ll progress down a mission tree, collecting upgrades and doing some mech tinkering. The meat of it is the missions, where you’ll command a team of rock-paper-scissors aligned mechs to fend off enemy waves, and maybe do some sub-objective capturing too.</p>
<p>These tiles keep lying to me, making me expect some sort of action economy, but no! You can move your mechs around freely. Really, the tiles are just there to signify your stomper’s firing range. There’s cover dotted about the map, as well as terrain advantages, so you end up rushing to set up little phalanxes between waves. There’s even extra mech abilities, like mine laying and the Mech Special, i.e a large jump that crushes whatever it lands on. It’s very much a learn-as-you-do game. The tutorial is solid as far as teaching the basics, but even the first mission drops a lot of different options on your plate as far as approaches go. The initial enemies are quite weak, to be fair, so there’s a margin for error here. I think it’s cool! Lots of ideas, really good energy to it. Also, mechs.</p>
<p>Best of all, there’s a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911860/Grit_and_Valor__1949/">Steam</a> at time of writing. If you like your mechs buried behind about 800% more interface, however, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">Edwin has you covered</a>. Unrelated, but has anyone made a mech game about giant evil Furbys with no fur yet? That’d go unbelievably hard, I reckon.</p>

The news comes from <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow">Inverse</a>, who’ve sent their dear alsatian companions sniffing around the mod’s Discord. Yesterday, Team FOLON lead Dean Carter shared the song I Just Can't Wait (For Tomorrow) then, when sniffed at harder, confirmed that the 'Tomorrow' part meant tomorrow (as in, today), "Unless nuclear war happens."</p>

<p>Fallout: London is, of course, the massive total conversion mod for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in dear ol’ blighttown. Uh, blighty. It’s from a team of around 50 developers, and over 200 contributors, which is wild and humbling and, gosh, we don’t deserve modders. Activities include shooting antique rifles, dressing like a bobby, and milking mutant cows. There’s even a bulldog, named Churchill, that you can recruit as a companion. It’s a wildly ambitious and impressive project, featuring a load of quests, plus original voice acting from the likes of Neil Newbon (from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>), and former UK Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow (not from Baldur’s Gate 3, iirc.)</p>
<p>Originally set to release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-the-impressive-fallout-4-mod-thats-basically-a-whole-new-game-has-a-release-date">back in April</a> after five years in development, Fallout: London was delayed indefinitely thanks to a chaotic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">'next-gen' update</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">broke a lot of mods</a> and generally made people quite unhappy. It is, of course, oh-so-easy to adopt the misinformed stance that that big bad Bethesda clumsily got in the way of people trying to make their game interesting. So, anyway: Bethesda messed everything up for the people trying to make their game interesting, and the team had to delay things so they didn’t break.</p>
<p>More recently, Team Folon sent <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1809555735681913115">a build to GOG</a> for testing, and it turned out that they still couldn’t get London and the next-gen update to play nice together. As such, players will need to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-want-to-play-that-whopping-fallout-london-mod-youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version">downgrade their copies of Fallout 4</a> to run the mod. No hassle - London will ship with a custom installer that also does the downgrading for you.</p>
<p>"GOG have been amazing through all of this. To be honest, we've been the ones causing them the issue," Carter told the Discord, via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-devs-confirm-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4-next-gen-version-not-stable-enough">VG247</a>. "What with us having things break due to the next-gen [update] and then needing the 3rd parties to update, then waiting for them to be fixed, only for the fact that at the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - [hence] the need for a downgrader."</p>
<p>Anyways, that’s all in the past now, and Fallout: London looks to be playable and set to arrive just in time for the weekend. You can find the mod on GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london">here</a>. Oh, and if you missed the other good Bethesda news, Bestheda Game Studios <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">announced a 'wall-to-wall' union</a> this week.</p>

<p>Concord’s beta hasn’t been a huge success for Firewalk Studios. It fell flat on its face on Steam, the number-one storefront and launcher platform on PC, drawing in just a few thousand players. Now that the dust has settled following the end of the beta phase, we can confirm that nobody wants to wishlist the game, indicating that the beta didn’t hit the spot with gamers anywhere.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Concord sits at #793 on the Steam Wishlist Leaderboard – and it’s being released in just under one month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-doa">DOA?</h2>



<p>Concord is a free-to-play shooter from Firewalk Studios that’s being released on PlayStation and PC next month. That’s the first indicator as to why so many people haven’t wishlisted the game – it’s <strong>free </strong>and there are no bonuses added for doing so. Presently, just 4,129 people have wishlisted the game on Steam, which is a paltry figure (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/concord-top-750-most-steam-wishlisted-games-after-disappointing-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to TheGamer</a> for noticing this miserable performance). </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, here are the wishlist numbers for some other upcoming titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>STALKER 2: 217,854 (#4)</li>



<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite: 119,076 (#13)</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2: 61,630 (#24)</li>



<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard: 42,524 (#55)</li>



<li>State of Decay 3: 14,441 (#153)</li>
</ul>



<p>It was recently revealed that Concord <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass-and-will-add-new-characters-and-maps-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have a battle pass mechanic</a> – but it will have cosmetic-based microtransactions. That’s something of a win for players, but it’s not enough good news to drive up the hype for the upcoming shooter. </p>



<p>Concord was revealed during Sony’s latest PlayStation showcase, but it didn’t turn too many heads. For one thing, people are generally tired of the Overwatch-esque first-person hero shooters. It’s an overdone trope that’s no longer interesting or innovative enough to make gamers excited.</p>



<p>Are you going to give Concord a try when it releases next month?</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> have quietly released a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> demo on PS5. If you’ve yet to play the open world samurai sim, you can head over to the PlayStation Store now to download the playable preview. This arrives alongside a new title update – <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1816130076385456418/photo/2">version 1.07</a> – that includes fixes for a swathe of minor bugs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - The Aftermath Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34FMSgdzzvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Those who have been sitting on the fence will be able to play the game’s first chapter in full, the Rise of the Ronin demo having no time limit. Naturally, you’ll be able to carry over your save data should you pull the trigger and purchase a copy of the full game.</p>
<p>The latest PlayStation exclusive from <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> studio, Team Ninja, Rise of the Ronin is an action RPG game set in Japan during the transformative Bakumatsu period. This era, spanning the late 19th century, marked the end of the Edo period and the coming of the Meiji Restoration, characterised rapid modernisation, clashing cultures, and the move away from long-held Japanese traditions.</p>
<p>Rise of the Ronin casts players as, well, a ronin: a samurai warrior with no master, free to roam Japan at a time of major political and social upheaval.&nbsp;On your historical quest, you will engage with various factions vying for power, including the Tokugawa shogunate and imperial loyalists.</p>


<p>One of the game’s highlights is its frenetic melee combat which expands over time as you level up and unlock a broad arsenal of weapons. Unlike previous Team Ninja titles, Rise of the Ronin features an immersive open world that can be explored on foot, horseback, or even airborne.</p>
<p>In our own review we scored it a stellar 9/10, Aran saying that “Rise of the Ronin is a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>

<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm vanished exactly one month ago after allegations surfaced claiming he was inappropriately messaging a minor several years ago, which ultimately led to his permanent ban from Twitch. In a lengthy statement posted on Twitter, the charismatic and controversial streamer copped to it, stressing that ‘nothing illegal happened’ but that the messages ‘leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate’. He then said he would be taking an extended vacation with his family and promptly disappeared.</p>



<p>Now, for the first time in a month, he has updated his social media channel on Twitter, changing his banner image to something cryptic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-dr-disrespect">What Happened with Dr Disrespect?</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect was shunned by the wider gaming community when the news surfaced that he’d been inappropriately messaging a 17-year-old female on Twitch in 2017. He lost connections and sponsorships, and he was even forced to leave Midnight Society, the development studio that he founded to create an extraction shooter – DEADROP.</p>



<p>He was called out by his closest peers on social media, with the likes of TimTheTatman, NICKMERCS, and Ninja saying their piece about the debacle.</p>



<p>Now, in a subtle change, Dr Disrespect <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has updated his Twitter</a> (now known as ‘X’) profile. He has uploaded a cryptic banner that shows a fishing bobber floating in a dark ocean. On the bobber is Dr Disrespect’s iconic logo, and it’s wrapped in the red hue that we’ve come to associate with the streamer (thanks to <a href="https://gamerant.com/dr-disrespect-social-media-page-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a> for the tip):</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to judge this change and to take a guess at what it meant. It could be a representation of Dr Disrespect feeling lost at sea and alone, or it could be a visual representation of ‘bait’, with Dr Disrespect trying to pique the curiosity of gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>It could just be an indication that Dr Disrespect is fishing on vacation – that’s also possible, but it seems too obvious.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, while he changed his Twitter banner, he neglected to remove the link to Midnight Society from his bio.</p>

<p>It was a long time coming, but the (surprise) release date for Fallout: London has finally arrived, with the team having confirmed that today, July 25, will see the launch of this game-sized mod. Following several years of development that saw issues come and go, celebrities lend their voices to the project, and countless developer blogs get published online, the day has finally come around.</p>



<p>Today, you will be able to play Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-years-in-the-making">Years in the Making</h2>



<p>In a quote picked up by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, the FOLON team said that Fallout: London will be released today ‘unless nuclear war happens’. While there’s always a chance of that, it looks unlikely (he says, glancing out of the window). Therefore, after years of waiting and several pushbacks – the most major of which was caused by the Fallout 4 next-gen update – Fallout: London is about to be listed for download.</p>



<p>This free, super-sized mod comes with a caveat or two, though. Firstly, you’ll need to downgrade your Fallout 4 next-gen update to play it, but don’t worry, the mod has a feature that does that automatically. Also, it’s a beast of a mod – we don’t have the confirmed size, but it’s expected to be more than 30 GB in total.</p>



<p>For the hardcore Fallout fans, Fallout: London is a lore-breaking mod, but it’s an intriguing one. Almost a decade after Fallout 4 was released, Fallout: London offers one of the broadest reimaginations of the universe we’ve ever seen, boasting a fully-voiced cast, a massive open-world map of London, new factions, an immersive story, and much more. </p>



<p>It’ll only be available for PC players, but there are whispers that the team wants Bethesda’s help to bring the mod to Xbox. For now, it’s going to be made downloadable through GOG – but the link isn’t available just yet.</p>



<p>Fallout: London launches today, July 25 – will you be playing?</p>

<p>The esports industry is growing at an alarming rate, with more multi-million-dollar tournaments surfacing every day. One of the most exciting and popular parts of the industry is the concept of esports betting, and with each new event, thousands of esports bets are placed against players, teams, and the inner workings of the tournament itself.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, the concept of esports betting was alien – it now makes up 50% of the industry’s revenue. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about esports betting, from how to bet on esports to what the best esports betting sites are.</p>



<p>Can you bet on esports? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-esports-betting-legal">Is Esports Betting Legal?</h2>



<p>That’s a great question to start with – is it <strong>legal </strong>to place bets on esports games? It all depends on where in the world you are. In some countries, any kind of betting is illegal, and naturally that’ll extend to esports betting. In most countries that allow gambling, esports betting is just another facet of that concept, which means that yes, it’s legal to bet on esports.</p>



<h3><strong>Is Esports Betting Legal in the United Kingdom?</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, esports betting is legal in the United Kingdom – it’s also massively popular and the top game for esports bettors is Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-esports-betting-legal-in-the-us"><strong>Is Esports Betting Legal in the US?</strong></h3>



<p>In the United States, esports betting is only 100% legal in a few states: Nevada, New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia. It’s a list that’s forever expanding, as over time, more states are opening their doors to the concept of esports betting.</p>



<p>Esports is becoming a more mainstream concept all the time. Globally, there are almost half a billion enthusiasts, and recently, the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IOC announced</a> the upcoming Olympic Esports Games, which adds yet another avenue for legal esports bettors to target.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-bet-on-esports">How to Bet on Esports</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It couldn’t be easier to place a bet against some top-tier esports odds these days. It’s a matter of tracking down your desired esports betting site, navigating to the esports section, and then placing wagers. Betting on esports is the same process that you’d follow to bet on football or basketball – even a lot of the esports betting markets are the same as traditional sports betting markets.</p>



<p>To that end, here are some of the best esports betting sites to get you started:</p>



<ul>
<li>Thunderpick</li>



<li>Bet 365</li>



<li>GG.BET</li>



<li>LOOT.BET</li>



<li>Betway</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, you’ll use the same betting sites you would for traditional sports to bet on esports. It’s just another angle that they’ve taken to try and dominate their corner of the industry, and for the most part, it works well – esports betting is <strong>very </strong>popular.</p>







<h2 id="h-tips-for-esports-betting">Tips for Esports Betting</h2>



<p>If you’re a seasoned bettor, you’ll have no problems getting to grips with esports gambling, but there are a few key tips you can still walk away with if you want to improve your odds.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Study Your Markets </strong>– Make sure you understand the markets you’re playing, and more importantly, that you know how to read the esports odds.</li>



<li><strong>Know Your Game </strong>– It’s almost pointless betting on an esports game that you don’t understand. You wouldn’t take part in Counter-Strike betting if you didn’t know the first thing about the game, would you? It’s a solid tip to learn about the game you’re betting on.</li>



<li><strong>Understand Your Budget </strong>– As with sports betting, making sure that you control your budget when betting on esports is vital.</li>



<li><strong>Only Use Trusted Sites </strong>– Some esports betting sites take advantage of the freshness of the vertical to entrap unaware players – make sure you’re only using a reputable, trusted esports betting site.</li>



<li><strong>Take Advantage of Bonuses</strong> – Almost every esports betting site offers betting bonuses and promotions – make sure you’re soaking these up to maximise your profits.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now that you know the inner workings of esports betting, are you going to place some wagers?</p>

<p>If you have been following Olympic news recently, you might have seen that the Olympics officially voted to add esports to its list of competitions. This decision marks a historic landmark within the world of esports, as competitive gaming is constantly on the rise. But what games are set to be played at this inaugural, landmark event?</p>



<p>Here is a list of all the games at the Esports Olympics.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-games-at-the-esports-olympics">All Games At The Esports Olympics</h2>



<p>While many popular esports titles will be seen in the Olympics, quite a few did not make the cut. In fact, all shooting games were left out of being a part of the competition.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This means that games such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, Valorant, Counter-Strike and more will not appear during the 2025 Esports Olympics.</p>



<p>But there are still quite a few other popular titles that are going to be included. <strong>Here is a list of every game that will be in the Esports Olympics:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Street Fighter</li>



<li>Tekken</li>



<li>iRacing</li>



<li>NBA 2K</li>



<li>FIFA</li>
</ul>











<figure></figure>







<p>First released in 2009, <strong>League of Legends</strong> has become a staple when it comes to the gaming and&nbsp;esports community. The game has one of the biggest competitive fanbases, as many of its players are known worldwide.</p>



<p>With many historic and large-scale tournaments, this popular MOBA has yet to decline in popularity. Massive gaming organizations, such as G2, Team Liquid, Cloud9 and many more have had a hand in this series for years now. </p>



<p>With competitors such as Faker, Perkz, Uzi and others running the playing field, we should expect to see some swift competition when it comes to League of Legends in the Olympic Games. Who knows, though? We may see some new stars take the spotlight next summer.</p>



<p>This could be at the top of the most popular games at the Esports Olympics.</p>



<h2 id="h-rocket-league">Rocket League</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Originally released back in 2015 and now owned by Epic Games, <strong>Rocket League</strong> has become as well-known as any other popular video game. With various crossovers with different franchises and games such as Fortnite, this popular car-soccer game has been a hit for years now.</p>



<p>And now, it is officially a part of the Olympics.</p>



<p>While Rocket League has been a competitive esport for some time now, it has not been until recent years that the RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) skyrocketed in popularity. With some of the biggest teams in esports investing in this game, tournaments have begun to grow and grow.</p>



<p>Many large-scale in-person events are held across the globe, with features at DreamHack, The Esports World Cup and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter">Street Fighter</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Being one of the earliest esports, <strong>Street Fighter</strong> has continued to grow amongst fans all across the world. The fighting game may seem simple on the outside, but the mechanics and plays that go into this title make it just as difficult and competitive as any other esport.</p>



<p>With the Evo being one of the biggest tournaments each year, Street Fighter has continued to pave the way for other competitive games. Unlike other games, Street Fighter requires players to practice and get used to the skills of a specific character.</p>



<p>This makes the competition much more exciting to watch, as each popular competitive player has a specific character they choose to play.</p>



<p>Which character will be crowned the best at next year’s Olympic Esports?</p>



<h2 id="h-tekken">Tekken</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another historic fighting game to join the Olympic Esports is <strong>Tekken</strong>. With the first game premiering back in 1994, Tekken has been a direct competitor with fighting games such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Super Smash Bros.</p>



<p>Like other fighting games, Tekken has a list of characters, all with different and unique skill sets, that players can learn to fight with. Developed by Capcom, this game has gone from being a fun arcade title to now being in the Olympic Esports.</p>



<p>Do not be fooled, though. To some, games such as Tekken look just to be filled with button mashing, but the game requires a heavy knowledge of the character’s techniques to develop different strategies when fighting.</p>



<p>Out of all Esports Olympic games, this is by far one of the most exciting.</p>



<h2 id="h-iracing">iRacing</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>You can’t have a large-scale esports tournament without including some sort of racing game. Developed by Microsoft, <strong>iRacing</strong> is sort of a distant cousin to Flight Simulator. Played with an actual wheel controller, iRacing puts players in realistic racing scenarios.</p>



<p>The fact that this game does not require a traditional type of controller is what makes it so unique, especially for being put in the Olympic Esports. The game may have been released back in 2008 but has seen a plethora of updates, which have given it close-to-real graphics. </p>



<p>With different cars to race with and many different tracks to race on, iRacing makes for the perfect racing title to join the Olympic Esports.</p>







<h2 id="h-nba-2k">NBA 2k</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>At least one type of sports game needs to be included in the Olympic Esports and it seems as if <strong>NBA 2K</strong> has made the cut. With many sports games, other than FIFA, only being popular within the US, NBA 2K has made strides within the world of esports.</p>



<p>Being one of the biggest sporting games in esports, this title allows players to play as professional basketball athletes, forcing them to choose different plays and strategies when facing off against other teams.</p>



<p>Throughout the last half a decade, NBA 2K has grown quite increasingly in the world of esports. In fact, a new title is released every single year. With basketball already being a part of the regular Olympics, having the video game version of it too is exciting.</p>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc">EA Sports FC</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>With football (soccer) being the biggest sport in the world, <strong>FIFA</strong> (now known as EA Sports FC) seems like the best sports game to include in the Olympic Esports. Back in 1993, the first FIFA video game was released. Since then, the FIFA franchise has taken the gaming world by a stronghold.</p>



<p>With popular players such as Nicholas99fc, Vejrgang and many more in the constant spotlight regarding FIFA, it will be interesting to see just how big this game shows up to be at the Olympics.</p>



<p>Like NBA 2K, football is also a sport in the regular Olympics. Which one will end up being bigger? The esports version? Or the regular version? We can expect this to be one of the best Olympic Esports games.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/flintlock-impressions-review-souls</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flintlock-is-as-good-as-a-2024-video-game-needs-to-be.936153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flintlock-impressions-review-souls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the middle of 2024 and I find myself in a weird place.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-crab-has-a-gun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> As I've said previously, I really do not like <em>Souls </em>games</a>. And yet this year I keep finding myself enjoying <em>Souls</em> games. What a time to be alive!</p><p><em>Jedi Survivor</em>? I loved it. <em>Lies of P</em>? Cool game! <em>The Crab Game</em>? Also excellent. I am now adding <em>Flintlock </em>to that list, a game I hadn't even properly heard of until last week, but which, despite its relative obscurity for me and its genre, has well and truly got me.</p><p>Yeah, it’s a Soulslike, so there are fundamentals that every game with that label shares. You rest at spots that reset enemies, there's concentration required for even the most mundane opponent, there are gruelling boss fights, devilish combos, upgrade trees and, most importantly, gross dead guys to kill.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which I could take or leave, to be honest, because like I've said I'm not a <em>Souls</em> guy! But I can tolerate them if the wider setting and context is worth it, and just like it was with force-blasting stormtroopers off cliffs and giving a little crab a huge gun, the setting and context of <em>Flintlock </em>was very much worth it for me.</p><p><em>Flintlock</em>--I can't believe a game hasn't used that name already--is set in a fantasy world where humanity fights to hold back the hordes of the undead. The catch is that the ones holding them back aren't sword-wielding medieval types (though the game does feature them), but 19th-century soldiers. Imagine the US Civil War, or the Franco-Prussian War, just against...zombies. Trenches line the landscape, cannons are aimed at the gates of hell and humanity's first line of defence are wearing backpacks and firing muskets.</p><p>I like it! It's a fresh take on not just the setting but the combat as well, as <em>Flintlock </em>pairs a firearm and melee weapon about as well as any fantasy game ever has, from <em>Fable </em>to <em>Dishonored</em>. Much of the game's combat is built around juggling both of your weapons’ strengths and weaknesses, like your flintlock being able to blast at enemies from a distance, but then can only be reloaded by engaging in a certain amount of melee action.</p><p>Rounding out a trinity of powers is the help you get from a tiny little god, who is along for the ride and to help you kill much bigger gods by sharing some of his powers with you. Switching between your multiple means of attack, as well as having to constantly block, evade and parry keeps every encounter interesting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fl8YHNlC8fE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Anyway, enough of the standard impressions stuff. What I <em>really</em> want to say about this game is that from the second you fire it up, it's clear that despite its best attempts, this is definitely not a AAA experience, at least as we have come to expect from 2024.</p><p>Yet it feels like one from a bygone era, something from a decade ago. It looks great, has a well-developed style, sharp visuals, quality writing and voice acting (including regular lines from Adam Jensen's Elias Toufexis). Even the menus are slick. You could have told me this was a centrepiece game at E3 2016 on the PlayStation stage and I would have believed you without hesitation.</p><p>Please know this is not a bad thing. In 2024, it still looks and plays just fine. I found myself playing <em>Flintlock </em>at the same time I was replaying <em>Wolfenstein: New Order</em>--an actual AAA game from a decade ago--and comparing the two, and the amount of fun I was having with both, I just kept thinking this is all I need. This is all video games need to be.</p><p>I know<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this is a topic I've already touched on this year while battling my way through half the <em>Call of Duty</em> series</a>, but I want to repeat it here: the absurd amounts of time, money and manpower being spent on modern AAA video games are unsustainable, and worse, not even worth it. What we've long suspected--<a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and had pretty much confirmed by the sums revealed in the Insomniac dump</a>--is that the diminishing returns of the fidelity arms race are going to end up killing every studio until the only blockbuster developers left are Rockstar and whoever is still standing to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> game.</p><p>As a sports fan, and also a games writer pondering the death spiral much of the industry finds itself in, <em>Flintlock's</em> suitability got me thinking: what if video games had a salary cap? What if games had a finite amount of resources that could be spent on them, instead of the gaping, fiery maw that AAA budgets currently look like? A ceiling that would curb the rampant excess currently driving studios to the wall, and force more imaginative thinking from publishers (thinking that, to their credit,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366957330_Out_of_Red_Ocean_and_Soaring_into_Blue_Ocean_The_Wii_U_Nintendo_Selling_Strategy_in_Gaming_Industry#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20idea%20to,making%20to%20competition%20primarily%20irrelevant." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Nintendo settled on years ago</a>). What if Activision, instead of<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt-1NiFrWQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> trying to recreate Claudia Doumit in digital form</a>, had to actually do something original and interesting with <em>Call of Duty</em>?</p><p>Please note I'm not <em>actually </em>suggesting this. It's just a thought exercise, brought about by playing these two games at the same time. Trying to implement such a thing would lead to much the same behind-the-scenes fuckery that we see in sports, replacing one set of labour and financial issues with new ones.</p><p>But my point is that if there <em>was </em>a salary cap, it should be set at whatever it cost to make <em>Flintlock</em>. We don't need anything more than this.</p><p>I wish--and fans of <em>Lies of P</em> or <em>Plague Tale</em> or <em>Blood West</em> or any other AA games will say the same thing--there were more games like this! <em>Flintlock </em>had restrictions on its resources, sure, but it picked a genre, had a vision and executed it as best it could. It doesn't matter that it doesn't have the latest in next-gen visuals or a $150 million marketing budget. It didn't need a huge open world, or to feature lifelike facial animations. I just wanted to sit down last week and play a cool video game-ass video game, and <em>Flintlock </em>delivered.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over 500 developers at Blizzard, making up the entire World of Warcraft team, have officially formed a union, it was announced on Wednesday. </p>



<p>The Communications Workers of America&nbsp;(CWA) <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced the formation</a> of the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild – CWA Union (WoWGG-CWA) with the Microsoft-owned organization. The new union includes all designers, engineers, producers, artists, quality assurance testers, and other game developers at Blizzard. It’s the “first wall-to-wall union at Activision Blizzard and the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</p>



<p>“What we’ve accomplished at World of Warcraft is just the beginning,” Eric Lanham, Test Analyst and member of the WoWGG-CWA, said via release<em><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></em> “My colleagues and I are embarking on a quest to secure better pay, benefits, and job security through a strong union contract. We know that when workers have a protected voice, it’s a win-win for employee standards, the studio, and World of Warcraft fans looking for the best gaming experience.”</p>



<p>With the formation of the WoWGG-CWA, over 1,750 workers a Microsoft-owned studios have unionized. Just last week it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at Bethesda became the first</a> Microsoft studio to fully unionize.</p>



<p>“This victory, built on years of foundation work since the launch of the Game Workers Unite movement at GDC, reflects a deeply rooted commitment to change,” Tom Smith, Senior Director of Organizing at CWA, said. “Unionizing one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry, from AAA studios like SEGA and Bethesda to indie developers.”</p>



<p>Activision-Blizzard has yet to publicly comment on the WoWGG-CWA formation.</p>

While some of the pictures highlight what appear to be early-in-development locations and gameplay modifiers, others are instantly recognizable.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/multiversus-blogroll-1716421095391.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Harry Potter and Barbie content may soon join the MultiVersus family.</figcaption></figure></output><p>One<a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815827879361487036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>notable example</u></a> shows a stage with broomsticks that hover above a platform decorated with four distinct colors: blue, red, green, and yellow. It doesn’t take a Harry Potter expert to recognize that the broomsticks could signal that the map is intended to be Quidditch-themed, but those banners also seem to be placeholders for the universe’s four houses, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. While no Harry Potter representative can be seen in the image, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the stage accompanied by someone like Dumbledore or Hermione should Harry Potter content ever make its official MultiVersus debut.</p><p>The datamine also reveals a stage that is unmistakably inspired by last year’s megaton movie hit, Barbie. The <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815821132651548714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-pink location</a> is dressed with palm trees, multiple levels to fight on, and a twisty slide that seems to lead to a pool. It looks almost exactly the same as star Margot Robbie’s Barbie Dreamhouse, though like the Harry Potter stage, it lacks any Barbie or Ken character representation.</p><p>Other MultiVersus datamine images show off heavily rumored characters like the <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815780822080794744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815780738706329909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DC’s Nubia</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815781343889899559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Time’s Marceline</a>, though until developer Player First Games has anything to announce, it’s best not to expect any of the content shown to officially appear in-game. It's at least clear that the developer has more plans behind the scenes, as Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition"><u>moved to acquire the studio</u></a> earlier this week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>MultiVersus is still in the midst of renewed player interest following its re-launch in May.

With this, Blizzard Entertainment has its first ever “wall-to-wall” union, encompassing the entirety of a game development team instead of just one division, like QA. The union includes designers, engineers, producers, artists, QA testers, and other developers, most of whom are based in either Irvine, CA, or are part of a smaller team in Massachusetts. The group is called World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild, or WoWGG, and is a part of Communications Workers of America (CWA).</p><p>Additionally, a second group of Activision-Blizzard QA workers based in Austin, Texas have formed a separate union with Communications Workers of America, called Texas Blizzard QA United. The roughly 60 developers involved primarily work on Diablo, Hearthstone, and other games. Both unions concluded their votes today and have been officially recognized under Microsoft’s labor neutrality agreement and certified by an independent arbitrator.</p><h2>Something need doing?</h2><p>Speaking ahead of the election’s conclusion, World of Warcraft senior producer Samuel Cooper told me that organizing work on the WoW team began in earnest near the end of 2021 after a (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-to-pay-about-54-million-to-settle-major-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"><u>since-settled</u></a>) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california"><u>California lawsuit</u></a> alleging instances of harassment, inequality, and bro culture at the company. In the weeks and months that followed, the company put out a series of statements, but in June 2021 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-walkout"><u>Blizzard employees staged a walk-out demanding further action</u></a>. Cooper tells me the walkout was the “spark” that eventually led to further organizing efforts and, now, WoWGG.</p><p>So why did it take three years? Organizing takes time, and 500 people is a <em>lot.</em></p><p>“You can't just fire off an email blast and then have a bunch of people swarm in,” Cooper says. “It's mostly individual conversations between people who know and care about each other. It is gradual, but it's also exponential. The more of those conversations you have, the more people there are having them.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cooper tells me he got involved in organizing in hopes of having “a more democratized way of representing employees in the workplace.” He later convinced senior quest designer Paul Cox to join in. Cox tells me he was frustrated that the voices of ground level employees weren’t being represented in Blizzard’s response to the California lawsuit, and he wanted to make sure they were taken into account.</p><p>“This isn't an attack against our World of Warcraft leadership or something where we're like, ‘We hate those guys.’” he said. “We just want to make sure that our voices are being heard and that at some point we don't end up as numbers on a spreadsheet. Because you go up high enough and these people have never met any of us, none of the names mean anything to them.”</p><p>WoWGG’s initial “spark” and early organizing work took place while the company was still independent of Microsoft, but last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>it was acquired</u></a>. As a result, Blizzard employees benefited from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u>Microsoft’s prior commitment to labor neutrality</u></a>, effectively allowing them to organize in the open without company interference.</p><p><strong>Update 1:24pm PT:</strong> Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-union-microsoft-response-1236083616/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered the following statement to Variety</a> with regard to today's unionization announcements: "We continue to support our employees’ right to choose how they are represented in the workplace, and we will engage in good faith negotiations with the CWA as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement."</p><p><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p>Cooper adds that Microsoft has upheld its commitment with regards to Blizzard.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We had CWA folks on campus for weeks on end, right in the middle, next to the big bronze orc.</p></div><p>“We had a lot of folks who, rightly or wrongly, felt fearful before,” Cooper says. “There are legal protections for organizing, but it can still be scary to have that change…We had CWA folks on campus for weeks on end, right in the middle, next to the big bronze orc. I think that really made people feel like it's not scary. I know they're not allowed to retaliate, but now I have confidence that they're not going to retaliate.”</p><p>Once they were able to organize openly, the WoW team’s efforts picked up speed throughout 2024. Cooper tells me the group was also emboldened by other game unions such as those at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-of-america-union-workers-ratify-contract-less-than-a-year-after-recognition"><u>SEGA</u></a> and fellow Microsoft unions at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize"><u>Zenimax</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-vote-to-form-largest-us-video-game-worker-union-to-date"><u>Activision</u></a>, many of whom had representatives on the Blizzard campus speaking with employees. The group even had a friendly race with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios"><u>unionizing employees at Bethesda Game Studios</u></a>, who won a similar election last week. “In a friendly way, we were seeing who was going to squeak in there first,” Cooper says. “Never happier to be outrun. Huge congratulations to them.”</p><h2>What's worth fighting for</h2><p>Cooper believes that WoWGG’s victory is part of a growing wave of industry unionization in recent years. He hopes their union can serve as inspiration to others, just as SEGA, Zenimax, and Activision inspired them. “Blizzard's a big name. We make great games, we occupy a position in the industry that I think has a lot of influence. The ability to show folks a large, very successful, very long-standing game…is able to do this and able to do it with all of our development groups, not just design or production and design or production design, engineering and art, but quality assurance, too, brought in and treated correctly as full development partners. We hope that that's the start of a paradigm shift across the industry.”</p><p>Though WoWGG is still a ways off from contract negotiations, Cox tells me that two big issues the union wants to put on the table are pay equity and work-from-home. On the latter, he says that most of the WoW team is required to be in office three days a week, and exceptions have been very, very limited. That’s been a huge issue for those who moved out of town during the pandemic, or bought houses, or who struggle to afford living in Irvine, CA. “We've lost some really great folks who have just been like, ‘I don't want to come back into the office. I like the fact that I don't have an hour and a half commute every day,’” Cox says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>World of Warcraft: The War Within Pre-alpha Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Cooper adds, “Long-standing partners who I personally really relied on that we've had to figure out how to move forward without. It's a huge topic for us. Ultimately, how these things shake out in bargaining, how we prioritize pay against promotion transparency, against layoff protections, against work-from-home and other concerns. That'll really be up to our friends and teammates, our members, to survey, but those are big topics.”</p><p>Fundamentally, both Cooper and Cox tell me their desire to unionize comes out of a deep love for Blizzard and the work they do on World of Warcraft. Both of them have been at Blizzard for over 15 years, and feel invested in making it a better place to work for themselves and all their teammates.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you want a place to stay good, you've got to make the place good.</p></div><p>“Another one of our organizing committee members said, ‘There's a temptation when things get hard at a job to go look for a job where things are easier. But this is a tough industry, you can jump and you may experience some improvement for a while, but if you want a place to stay good, you've got to make the place good,’” Cooper explains. “Unionizing, I think, it's going to make a difference for us. I think it's going to make a difference for the company, a positive difference that'll help us be more successful in all senses and take better care of our people. I think that's going to ripple out to the industry, even the players. I'm excited for the future.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/courtisans-card-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Gaming has a very long tradition of very small card games that allow players to be very mean to one another. Arguably it goes back to the days of playing cards and the Hearts family of evasive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games">trick-taking</a> where you’re trying to avoid winning points, some versions of which see you passing pain cards to other players, and getting their cruft in turn. </p><div catalogid="53b021f6-76fe-4bb7-a747-922595d8f1dc" id="205185"><div id="205185" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Courtisans Card Game</h3></p></div><p>So it’s a crowded market to venture into, but with it’s super-simple rule set and beautiful cards, Courtisans clearly feels it has the chops to make a splash nevertheless. </p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><p>As a small-box card game, there’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality. The main draw is the main deck of tarot-sized cards in five colors, representing five noble families, each one luminous with characterful artwork and gold embossing. They’re an absolute delight, justaposing a character and its suite symbol – which doubles as a color marker for the colorblind – in the manor of a court card from a deck of playing cards. </p><p>The rest of the compact box is less attractive. There’s a much smaller, much plainer deck of objective cards and a rolled-up board made of printed fabric depicting the families feasting at the queen’s table. The art is in the same grand style as the cards, and rolled up boards are easy to store but fabric, while eco-friendly, isn’t the most practical choice. Because it’s stored in a roll, it won’t lie flat on the table without a sheet of perspex or an iron. This isn’t a major issue during play as cards go above or below the board, not on it, but it is a shame that it doesn’t show off more of that glorious art to full effect.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><p>Gamers have a bit of a reputation for claiming that games are simple when they’re anything but, and this is particularly true of card games when half the rules can be printed on the cards themselves. But Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn. On your turn, you draw three cards from the deck. One, you keep face up in front of you. Another you place, face up, before an opponent of your choice. And the third you place either above or below the Queen’s table, in the column matching its suit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn.</p></div><p>Once the deck runs out, suits that have more cards above the table than below are “esteemed” and each one in a player’s tableau is worth a point. Those with more cards below than above are “fallen” and each costs you a point. Cards with a x2 icon are worth double in both reckonings. Tot up your points, and see who’s won. The only other complexities to this formula are a smattering of special cards: spies do not reveal their suit until the game ends, assassins remove a card from whatever area they’re laid in, and guards can’t be assassinated.</p><p>You’ve now learned almost the entire rules of Courtisans. And you would not believe just how much angst is lurking below that smooth, approachable ruleset and those lovely cards.</p><p>The fact that you lay almost all the cards face up, the odd spy excluded, means there’s nowhere to hide. When a pile of red cards are cowering pitifully below the queen’s table, and you give another player a red card, that’s an outright act of aggression. You’re saying, “I want you to lose”, and no amount of apologetic talk or sour-puss facial expressions can disguise it. It’s like the famous, blood-draining, knife-twist betrayals of Diplomacy, allegedly Henry Kissinger's favorite board game, except you haven’t taken seven hours to get there, and you’ll commit a dozen more such hostilities in this game alone.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality.</p></div><p>And the game contains a number of ways to make every gut-punch worse. You can give someone an out-of-favor suit and make it worse by adding the same suit to the stack below the table. You can double the misery in both respects by doing the same with one or two x2 cards. You can give someone an assassin in an out-of-favor suit and kill one of their higher scoring, in favor, cards. And then you can rub salt in the wounds by laying the one decent option in your three-card draw in your own tableau.</p><p>This outright, in-your-face meanness does mean that the game works best with four. With two, you’ve only got one target. With three, and to a lesser extent with five, it’s very easy to dogpile one poor player into oblivion relatively early in the game, although given it only takes a quarter-hour to play that’s hardly the end of the world, and no doubt your bullying will be remembered in turn for the next hand. But four strikes the perfect balance of blow and counterblow.</p><p>In all cases, you’ll have to do your level best to direct the pain away from yourself and toward other players, in the time-honored fashion of trying to persuade people to target the current leader. Some people love this kind of trash talk, others hate it, and this probably isn’t a game for them. But to prevent anyone from becoming an easy target, there’s one final cog to the game’s mechanisms: everyone gets two secret missions. These are all straightforward, like ensuring a particular suit is fallen or esteemed or owning two assassins. But they do the job very effectively, muddying the waters and adding to the excitement while giving you a reason to keep a poker face when someone slaps a card down.</p><p>At this point, it feels important to mention that luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve. While the initial few plays are uncertain, mapping out the status of the different suits and the interpersonal dynamics between the players for the game to come, the collection of cards rapidly reaches a level where decision-making is decidedly non-obvious. A simple card might raise or lower someone’s score, but then there are the hidden goals to be aware of. And the special cards inject additional dynamism: assassins in particular make it very difficult to properly weigh the correct course of action. The card itself may be worth a point, or not, but its choice of target can also impact the game in subtle ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve.</p></div><p>This uncertainty dovetails beautifully with the social aspects of the game, into an ouroboros that’s likely to end up eating someone at the table along with its tail. You start to feel like every play contains both a social and a strategic message. What does it mean that the player opposite gave a green to their neighbor? Does it say something about their own secret goals, or the spies they placed the turn before? Or is it more of a gotcha revenge moment, for that neighbor dumping rubbish on them early in the game, or even for a disagreement they had last week? Is it worth making an argument out loud for the table? And if so what form should it take, and what will persuade your fellow players that might give you an edge? It’s amazing how such a tiny game can tease at all the communal faultlines around the table. </p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/oeDE6?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/W0bbx?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Adeew?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Pandasaurus</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 24, 2024 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Courtisans is a nasty game with very significant random and social factors, and for a chunk of gamers that’s enough to make them walk away. However, in the wide, deep sea of take-that games in which Courtisans belongs, it’s a shark in it’s own right: sleek, powerful and often taking you by surprise. There might not be a whole lot to this box, either in terms of content quantity or rules, but it does what it’s supposed to do pretty much perfectly.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Concord, the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter from Sony's Firewalk Studios, is bucking the battle pass trend, with its developer telling players, "You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p>
<p>
Firewalk Studios announced the news in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayConcord/status/1816141419914093045">series of posts</a> on social media, explaining Concord won't have a battle pass because it "wanted to focus [its] attention on making Concord a rewarding and robust experience on day one, where just playing the game, levelling up your accounts and characters, and completing jobs yields meaningful rewards."
</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/markderidder/status/1816152226815172785">seperate post</a>, Concord gameplay animation director Mark DeRidder wrote, "No Battle Pass, folks. You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p>
<p>
It's certainly an increasingly unusual, if not unwelcome, choice in a world where it feels like every major live-service game - including the Sony published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> - comes with a time-sucking battle pass (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-is-evolving-its-battle-pass-by-splitting-it-in-two-and-charging-players-twice">or two</a>). Firewalk has, however, previously confirmed the £35/$40 game will be further monetised via cosmetic character customisation items.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's posts, the studio noted Concord will include additional cinematics beyond those featured in its recent open beta, and will receive new Freegunners (as its heroes are known), maps, modes, and more in regular post-launch seasons and updates. These will be made available to all players at no additional cost.
</p>
<p>
Firewalk also confirmed Concord will including single-player training modes at launch (but no solo-specific play modes), alongside six "distinct" 5v5 team-based modes, and "multiple" unlockable variants for each of its 16 heroes.
</p>
<p>
Concord launches for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam and Epic on 23rd August. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">took a look at the 5v5 shooter</a>, declaring it good. "The bad news," he continued, "is I can't figure out how good, just yet... Each element done in absolutely the right way, but not necessarily in service of anything more than simply doing things the right way... My fingers are crossed for this one being given enough time to find its identity on the fly."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following on the heels of Friday’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wall-to-wall union at Bethesda Games Studios</a>, over 500 workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> have unionized under the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Like Bethesda’s union, the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild spans departments, including engineers, designers, artists, QA testers and more, in what the Guild calls “ the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</p><p><em>“</em>The decision by workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> to form a union marks a key inflection point in the broader movement for video game worker organizing industry-wide,” said Tom Smith, Senior Director of Organizing at CWA, in a press release. “This victory, built on years of foundation work since the launch of the Game Workers Unite movement at GDC, reflects a deeply rooted commitment to change. Unionizing one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry.”</p><p>Alongside the WoW Game Makers Guild, 60 Blizzard QA workers in Austin also formed a union today. Microsoft, parent company of Activision Blizzard, signed a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> with the CWA in 2022, agreeing not to stand in the way of organizing workers. That agreement went into effect 60 days after the finalization of Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, which was completed in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty promptly, Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 2,000 people</a> from its gaming division in January 2024. <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closures of four Bethesda studios</a> followed in May. Most recently, the FTC–which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/08/microsoft-activision-acquisition-ftc-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to block </a>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022– <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a letter to the US Court of Appeals</a> accusing the company of “exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged,” following Microsoft’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price hike</a> in early July. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-decries-ftcs-misleading-claims-of-degraded-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> by calling the FTC’s claims “misleading.”&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s easy to read both these unions as direct responses to all of that, the WoW Game Makers Guild makes specific mention of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/07/27/blizzard-employees-walkout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walkouts and protests</a> at Blizzard in 2021, which followed the company’s response to California’s sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the company. The press release calls today’s unionization “a significant milestone in [that] journey.”</p><p>It rules to see more unions in the games industry, especially interdisciplinary ones. Finding commonality with your colleagues across differences, and using those commonalities to change your workplace, is one of the best things about unions (ask me how I know!). If you haven’t experienced that for yourself yet, there’s never been a better time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>For those who want a hit of nostalgia, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered has finally gotten an official release date. This eccentric rock and roll adventure will hit Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch as of 31 October 2024. Pre-orders for this classic game are available except for on Nintendo Switch. The team will announce the release dates for this pre-order soon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwpT42plQiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The trailer</a> for the remaster is up on their YouTube channel and available now.</p>
<p>Grasshopper Manufacture will host a Grasshopper Direct on their YouTube channel on July 31, where interested fans can learn more about the upcoming game. Within this Grasshopper Direct, fans can expect to see the producer of Shadow of the Damned, Shinji Mikami, Suda51, and a couple of other members of the team who will all be present to answer your burning questions about the upcoming release, as well as take you on a deep dive into the development of this brand-new remaster.</p>
<p>The remaster of Shadows of the Damned comes with plenty of new features, such as new costumes. This new game plus+ mode carries your weapons and appearances over to your next play through, where the difficulty is upped, but you still get to be just as powerful, if not more so, as before.</p>
<p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered also comes with a new 60 FPS patch and 4K support, giving players the highest fidelity gameplay. Unfortunately for those on Nintendo Switch, you'll still be stuck at 30 FPS, with 4K support limited to Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam.</p>
<p>You play as Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter for those unfamiliar with the game. This comedic game allows you to fight off demons and traverse through Hell, fighting off various horrifying creatures. Garcia Hotspur is on this grand adventure to save the love of his life from a genuinely awful demon king.</p>
<p>Garcia Hotspur is joined by his trusty sidekick, Johnson the Skull, who provides comedic commentary as you explore the depths of Hell.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But SimsGuruNinja, an EA employee who works on the game, happened to be lurking in her chat, and his answer was as interesting as it was cryptic: "But don't worry. Elders will die better soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Predictably, the livestream's chat exploded with excitement, with Lilsimsie demanding answers.</p><p dir="ltr">"What do you know?!" she asked.</p><p dir="ltr">SimsGuruNinja replied, "Meant elder [Sims] will LOVE better soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the smiley face emojis included at the end of his message, the interaction seemed to indicate that SimsGuruNinja was simply keeping his cards close to the chest for the time being, because his reply to Lilsimsie's initial question about the exercise poster makes no sense in the context of love.</p><p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis have been known to hide Easter eggs with hints about future expansion packs within newly released DLCs. Even more damning is the fact that, throughout the Sims franchise, death-by-treadmill has been a relatively common demise for elderly Sims, who are at risk of dying of a heart attack if they do too much cardio with a low Fitness skill. They can even die from "WooHooing" too much. Including a poster of an elderly Sim doing cardio seems rather out-of-place in a DLC focused entirely on romance, which has led to speculation that the strange poster is a hint regarding the content of the game's next expansion pack.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims content creators, leakers, and even developers working on the game have also hinted at the existence of a death-based expansion pack, with one content creator--who also accurately predicted Lovestruck's existence--<a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1811855924430250426" rel="nofollow">cryptically tweeting</a>, "Honestly? I would DIE for another EP this year." Meanwhile, another "Sims guru" shared a cryptic tweet indicating that she's working on something big, and that it has nothing to do with the Lovestruck expansion pack, which releases July 25.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's even more evidence supporting the idea that a deadly new DLC may be on the way, and it's currently tucked away in the game's files. Based on information found via datamining, Sims fans have uncovered a tentative schedule that seems to suggest that another new expansion pack is indeed on the way, and there appear to only be two other DLCs (likely game packs, stuff packs, or kits) scheduled to come out between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sims-4-lovestruck-expansion-pack-adds-depth-to-sims-love-lives/1100-6524571/">Lovestruck</a> and the next expansion pack. According to <a href="https://simscommunity.info/2024/07/24/sims-4-expansion-pack-17-hints/" rel="nofollow">the game's files</a>, the order of release is as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 16</strong> (The Sims 4 Lovestruck expansion)</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 84</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 85</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 17</strong> (possible "Drop Dead" expansion)</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 86</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 87</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 88</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 89</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 18</strong> (unknown expansion)</li></ul><p>Though EA has yet to confirm anything regarding the upcoming expansion--which players are currently calling "the Drop Dead expansion pack"--it would certainly make sense to release a death-themed DLC around Halloween. Additionally, given the amount of time EA and Maxis have recently spent revamping Sims' love lives, it's high time they give ghost-Sims some appreciation, too. Since players now can plan a Sim's wedding right down to the attire of guests and the type of wedding cake topper, letting players plan detailed funerals--and experience fun new ways to kill off their least-favorite Sims--seems only fair.</p><p dir="ltr">Death has always been a major part of the franchise, with Sims capable of dying in a number of comical ways, from being squashed by a rogue Murphy bed (or meteor) to the classic death-by-drowning (in a pool that has had its ladders mysteriously removed by some unseen force). Sims who have obtained a special, very rare flower can plead for the life of a fallen fellow Sim, potentially causing the Grim Reaper to change his mind and let them live. On the other hand, they can always choose to simply let their simulated family member die, then start up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/ymchph/the_grim_reaper_is_my_roomate_and_woohoo_partner/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a romance with the Grim Reaper</a> instead.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> recently found itself in some hot water due to changes it was going to make to its battle pass. The studio had intended to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-will-now-have-two-battle-passes-per-season-says-respawn/1100-6524756/">break up the premium battle pass into two when Season 22 launched</a>. This upset much of the game's fanbase and the outcry worsened as Respawn revealed that players would now have to pay real-world money to unlock both battle passes instead of the usual choice of real money or Apex Coins (Apex Legends premium currency). Apex Legends' battle passes have always awarded Apex Coins, allowing players to purchase new passes by completing previous ones--this change would have removed that perk, meaning individual players would be pouring more money into the game than before</p><p>Shortly after that was announced, a significant portion of the Apex Legends community began pushing back against this. On July 24, Apex Legends issued a statement on its <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859" rel="nofollow ">official X/Twitter account</a> claiming that the team will not proceed with its original battle pass plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement explains that in Season 22, Apex Legends will continue to allow players to get the premium battle pass for 950 Apex Coins. "We recognize that we could have handled the battle pass changes better--that's on us," the Apex Legends team writes in the statement. When the season launches on August 6, players will have the chance to get the season's first premium battle pass by completing in-game challenges. When the second split occurs on September 17, players can purchase the season's second premium battle pass using the game's premium currency or real money with plans to run with this format going forward after that.</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-announces-changes-to-apex-legends-battle-pass-after-community-outcry" rel="nofollow ">interview with IGN</a>, Steven Ferreira, the creative director of Apex Legends, revealed that the studio had made these changes because the team wanted to be able to "track data on how many players are engaging with the battle pass" and that this was something the team did on its own without EA pushing them one way or the other.</p><p>According to the statement, going forward, whenever the team plans to implement significant changes, it'll slowly roll them out and engage more with the community instead of just dropping them.</p>
