			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC trailer was shared today, showcasing the enhanced visuals of the soon-to-be-released port and more.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYr0QZG82d0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC Features trailer</a>, which can be watched below, provides a quick overview of the port's features, which include improved lighting, enhanced visuals, NVIDIA DLSS support, a setting to change the number of NPCs on screen, mouse and keyboard support, and more. The trailer also features a quick comparison between Low, Medium, and High graphics presets, although the differences don't look massive in the few sequences shown.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/v-rising-sales-top-5-million-as-stunlock-promises-major-new-update.1078053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has reached another major new sales milestone, according to developer Stunlock, and there's a big new update in the works for the game as well.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has officially crossed the 5 million sales milestone, which the developer says "cements the game's status as one of the most popular survival games of recent years". It's hard to disagree with that, especially in conjunction with that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive Steam rating</a>.</p>

<p>These sales numbers mean that&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 2 million sales or so for itself since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-cross-3-million-threshold" rel="nofollow">hitting the 3 million mark back in January 2023</a>. Given that the game's 1.0 release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">landed in May last year</a>&nbsp;and that it hit PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-ps5-release-date" rel="nofollow">the following month</a>, that's perhaps to be expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-sales-5m-castle.jpg?itok=jsVheeQi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-sales-5m-castle.jpg?itok=lqebCDjG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales threshold (presumably after being asked to do so).</figcaption></figure><p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>, then perhaps the "big update" that's on its way to the game this year will convince you it's worth your time.</p>

<p>Stunlock says the update will bring a brand new biome that's "teeming with uncharted territories, a deadly new faction, and ancient technologies ready to be claimed".</p>

<p>In addition, you can look orward to revamped progression, a new Fusion Forge to help you craft "ultimate builds", and "risk-free PvP options" like the ability to duel other players, "customizable castle arenas", and more. All of this is on the way for free, too.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>, it's a sandbox survival game in which you play as a vampire lord attempting to build your very own vampiric empire in a hostile world.</p>

<p>You can construct your own castle, venture out into the world to find resources and battle enemies, and even team up with (or do battle with) other players.</p>

<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. There's no word yet on whether it's coming to other platforms.</p>

It’s also perfect for streaming games while laid up in bed at night—or while taking care of some, uh, natural business if you’re so inclined. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But however and wherever you decide to break out your PlayStation Portal, part of the appeal is having a way to play your games while not disturbing others. For instance, if you’re in bed next to your significant other and don’t want to wake them, you should be able to pop in some earbuds and keep all your noisy gaming to yourself, right?</p><p>Well, with the PlayStation Portal, you may find yourself a bit disappointed when it comes to headphone selections. Let’s dive into your options.</p><h2 id="h14142"><a id=""></a>Which headphones are compatible with PlayStation Portal?</h2><p>So, first of all, the PlayStation Portal comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, which means <strong>you can plug in any standard headphones and use them just fine</strong>. If you’ve got an old pair of wired earbuds in a drawer somewhere and don’t mind being tethered to the device with a wire, you’re golden.</p><p>However, things get more complicated if you want to use wireless headphones because, unfortunately, Sony has designed the PlayStation Portal to work exclusively with wireless audio devices that use its proprietary PlayStation Link connection. This means that any wireless headphones you already own likely won’t work with the PlayStation Portal.</p><p>So, which wireless devices <em>do</em> work? Well, you only have two options at this time.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PULSE Elite headset</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PULSE Explore earbuds</a></span></li></ul><p>Yeah, it’s kind of a bummer. Over time, there are sure to be additional headphones that use this technology, but it still kind of sucks to have to purchase an all-new audio device alongside a handheld system just to get such basic functionality.</p><p>Despite this frustrating decision by Sony, the PlayStation Portal remains one of the best ways to play your PlayStation games when you’re not near a console. And if handheld gaming is an important part of your life, it may be worth splurging to make the most of the experience. Or, you know, just dig out those wax-filled wired earbuds you bought back in 2009 and make do. </p><p>.<br>  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A full release will follow for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-937608"></span></p><p>Get the latest information below.</p><blockquote><p>Hack-and-slash fans will be able to discover an ancient world dominated by dragons and battle hordes of enemies. In the run-up to its Early Access release, Jonathan Gabrielli, lead game designer at Eko Software, will be taking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyZvo4H1rtY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nacon YouTube channel</a> on January 10 to give players a detailed look at the new features that they will be adding to this well-known genre.</p><p>Eko Software is a small team of enthusiasts behind the How to Survive series of games and <em>Warhammer Chaosbane</em>, released in 2019. As Hack’Nslash fans, some of them for several decades, they want to create an experience that is both a tribute to the references of the genre and an original and ambitious proposition, aimed at hardcore fans.</p><p>In this original adventure, which can be played alone or in cooperative play with up to four players (cooperative play will be implemented in the final version of the game), players choose one of the four available heroes (three heroes will be playable at the start of early access) with their own abilities and combat techniques, and set off to explore several environments, each with its own monsters, resources and challenges. Gradually, they develop their character through a skill grid called the Ancestral Grid. This is a truly unique mechanic that requires players to build their own skill tree by strategically placing Fragments obtained during gameplay, juxtaposed with multiple modifiers. Each hero has their own grid that offers endless combinations to create a truly unique character and combat style.</p><p>Another major element of the game is The City. As humanity’s last bastion, this city is a true evolving hub allowing players to upgrade their equipment, interact with NPCs with unique abilities, and customize their experience with visual improvements.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Once the main hunt has been completed, the endgame content is unlocked, giving access to new modes, bosses and battles for many, many hours of frenetic combat. The endgame content will be added to as the early access period progresses, right up to the final release of the game.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dragonkin: The Banished | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZplLwKdess?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Another day, another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> detail has apparently leaked out. Accessory listings have allegedly appeared in GameStop's internal computer system for employees. While the usual suspects are showing up for the hybrid system--a carrying case and Joy-Con charging stand, for instance--the microSD options are of particular interest. That's because Nintendo's next system seemingly will support express card functionality for expanded storage.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/?rdt=63367" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> revealed the alleged GameStop listings for Switch 2, with microSD express card options for 256GB and 512GB popping up. No brand is noted, though <a href="https://shop.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd-cards/sandisk-microsd-express-memory-card?sku=SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk</a> sells 128GB and 256GB versions (intriguingly not the 512GB option, however). Additionally, SanDisk says its microSD express cards offer read speeds that are 4.4 times quicker than the next fastest option. For video games specifically, this allows players to "start gaming faster and explore virtual worlds that appear more realistic than ever," according to the company. The current Switch doesn't support these cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">accessory company Genki claimed that Switch 2 will launch in April</a> while showing off a supposed replica of Switch 2 at CES in Las Vegas. This comes on top of unconfirmed pictures from an alleged Chinese factory of a person holding a left Joy-Con for Switch 2. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">The images have people speculating that the new controllers feature optical sensors</a>, meaning they could have mouse-like functionality.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo still hasn't unveiled anything official for the Switch successor, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">a full reveal should take place before the end of March</a>. Last month, a report stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-indeed-called-switch-2-report/1100-6528573/" data-ref-id="1100-6528573">the system will indeed be called Switch 2</a>.</p>

                <p>Video game voice actors in the SAG-AFTRA union have been on strike since July 2024, and one of the chief issues concerns the use of artificial intelligence. Jennifer Hale, who is among the most famous voice actors out there, has commented on the ongoing negotiations and why it's taking so long to resolve. She told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, "AI is an existential issue for all of us." Hale is best known for voicing Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, along with roles in Baldur's Gate, Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and Overwatch, among many others.</p><p>She said the "repercussions are vast" when it comes to AI, and this helps explain why the union and the video game publishers are taking their time to make a deal.</p><p>"I've been speaking to people on both sides over the last few months especially and there's a lot to learn on both sides," Hale said. "Some of the decision makers in that room who hold significant power are at the same time quite disconnected from how production happens. There are also many in that room who are deeply connected to the process. So there is such a wide variety of agendas at play."</p><p>She went on to say that some people at the negotiating table are receptive to having "productive conversations" about making a deal, while others, whom Hale said represent "large-scale corporate interest," are not willing yet to make a deal out of a concern for "profit protection in the future."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="917006698"

Hale was involved in those discussions, too, and she said a key difference between the strike of 2016 and 2024/2025 is that the two sides had productive side bars without attorneys involved.</p><p>"My understanding is that in this particular negotiation up until very, very recently, they haven't been allowed to talk to each other. They can each talk to their attorney, and then the attorneys talk to each other. And until you have the people with the vested interest having the conversations, all that's happening is billable hours are going up," she said, referring to attorney fees.</p><p>Overall, Hale described the two strike periods as being "vastly different," in part because the world is "much more polarized," with people living in "crazy echo chambers."</p><p>"A great negotiation ends up with everybody being a little unhappy. I think it's really important that we all remember, that is the definition of compromise. We're not in there to get our way. We're in there to protect our future," she said.</p><p>Back in August 2024, just after the strike began, Hale also spoke about why the fight against AI is so imperative.</p><p>"AI is coming for all of us," <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jennifer-hale-video-game-strike-sag-aftra-1236125843/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hale told Variety.</a> "Because the truth is, AI is just a tool like a hammer. If I take my hammer, I could build you a house.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-developer-direct-to-show-off-doom-the-dark-ages-and-more-on-january-23rd.1078020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Xbox Developer Direct presentation has been announced for later this month, and it will feature updates on upcoming Xbox games, including&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news site, the presentation will air on January 23rd. Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-release-date-revealed-during-xbox-developer-direct" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Developer Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-2024-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">showcases</a>, it'll offer "an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they're being created, and who's creating them".</p>

<p>The show will begin with a new look at Compulsion Games' action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and it'll continue with a trip to France to check in with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>developer Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=N3pntcyK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=c097vuwL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>is just one of the games that will be featured at this month's Xbox Developer Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>Following those two games, the presentation will switch focus to&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which is being developed by id Software over in Texas.</p>

<p>Perhaps most tantalizingly, though, Xbox says the showcase will end with a visit to a "surprise location" in order to see "another studio's brand new game". I wonder who that could be?</p>

<p>As ever with Developer Direct showcases, you probably shouldn't expect any extra reveals beyond what's been promised by Microsoft; outside of the "brand new game" that's being teased, it's likely the show will focus on the aforementioned three games.</p>

<p>As for what will be revealed regarding the three games outlined above, I'd be surprised if we didn't get a release date for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>at the very least, since the game is currently penciled in for a 2025 launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=lg1cyQ6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=9rBDTFXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get a&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>release date during this month's Xbox Developer Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is promising a "full game reveal" for&nbsp;<em>The Dark Ages</em>, as well as a "deep dive" into&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>and a behind-the-scenes look at&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em>. Developer Direct shows are traditionally more focused on dev processes than sizzle reels, so expect some interesting insider tidbits.</p>

<p>At any rate, the next Xbox Developer Direct will air on January 23rd at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific). Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong and his pal Diddy are two of Nintendo’s longest-serving mascots. The duo is due to hit screens again in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and the release date is close.</p>



<p>Nintendo has decided to halt production of new Donkey Kong for now games in favor of ports. Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze was released 11 years ago now—representing the most recent “new” DK game. It was ported to Switch in 2018, and Nintendo has decided to go even further back and port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong: Country Returns</a> to Switch as well.</p>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a case of the Switch being at the end of its lifecycle ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Regardless, it never hurts to see Donkey Kong again! The big, lumbering mammoth of a monkey is here, and Country Returns on the Switch likewise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-date">When is the Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Make way for Donkey. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Donkey Kong Country Returns release date for Nintendo Switch is January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, get your fingers out and start counting. The HD port of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD-2590475.html?nsuid=70010000084603#Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Country Returns</a> is gearing up to grace the Switch mere days from now. I’d say it looked pretty decent back in the day on the Wii, but a 2024 Switch release is worlds apart. </p>



<p>It’s also getting extra levels featured in the 3DS port, along with all the original features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Over 80+ levels</li>



<li>9 Worlds</li>



<li>Boss Battles</li>



<li>Lots of collectibles</li>



<li>Time Attack levels</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local co-op</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-time">Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>We expect Donkey Kong Country Returns on Switch to release at midnight everywhere.</strong></p>



<p>If games get a special release time, it’s usually announced ahead of launch. So far, we haven’t seen anything to suggest otherwise, so a midnight launch in your region is probably likely. Different timezones get to play Country Returns HD first—something I suffer from being in the UK—and DK fans will be going bananas for release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-platforms">All Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Yep, Nintendo Switch is the only platform Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is coming to.</strong></p>



<p>Not too much to add here if you don’t already know. Donkey Kong is one of Nintendo’s most cherished brands and lives on its consoles. You can play Country Returns on Wii and 3Ds, but the spruced-up, all-encompassing port is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<hr>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is one of several games being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in January 2025</a>. It’s a fairly quiet month, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest Nintendo games coming out in 2025</a> are sure to shake the foundations a bit.</p>



<p>Let us know if you are picking up a copy of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch. Plus, what do you think, is it time for Nintendo to pull their finger out and announce a new Donkey Kong entry?</p>

            <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he would be "delighted" to visit president-elect Donald Trump and "do everything we can" to help his administration succeed.</p>
<p>Huang was interviewed by Bloomberg following Nvidia's presentation at CES earlier this week, in which he discussed the company's AI technology and how AI will "reinvigorate" the gaming industry.</p>
<p>However, he's yet to receive an invite from Trump to Mar-a-Lago. "I'd be delighted to go see him," said Huang, "and congratulate him and do everything we can to help this administration succeed."</p>

<figcaption>Nvidia CEO Huang New Chips, AI, Musk, Meeting Trump<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOZYI3F1g7c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Huang is the latest tech boss to pay obeisance to Trump's regime, following Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who have all donated to Trump's inauguration fund.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, Huang would have made similar comments had Kamala Harris won the presidency instead, considering he's CEO of not only one of the biggest tech companies in the US but - for a brief time last year - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidias-market-value-surges-due-to-ai-prominence-rather-than-gpus">most valuable company in the world</a>.</p><p>It's perhaps Huang's flattery of Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk that's pertinent. Huang described Musk as "very optimistic" about the future of AI and is working on "some of the most important AI areas". Tesla is in fact a customer of Nvidia, with its AI tech included in vehicles.</p>
<p>AI has formed a major part of Nvidia's latest tech reveals, including its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080">GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Huang told Bloomberg: "At the limit, artificial intelligence is the single most important technology force of our time and we're at the beginning of that."</p>
<p>Further, he specified AI will "reinvigorate" the video game industry.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, for developers, it's going to reduce the cost of creating the content," he said. "On the other hand, all of the characters that are in the games are going to be smart characters in the future, so every time you interact with them they're going to be interacting with you in a much more intelligent way.</p><p>"And so the games are going to be more interesting, characters are going to be more interesting, the content development cost is going to decline, and that's going to be really great for the industry. I think the future's really bright for video games and these virtual worlds, and artificial intelligence is going to reinvigorate it."</p>
<p>Huang's comments on AI are a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">continuation of last year</a>: "We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," he said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference.</p>
<p>Still, not everyone shares his view on AI. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google works on new AI tools</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA's CEO</a> stated AI is "the very core of our business", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-says-ai-will-revolutionise-gaming-but-must-be-balanced-with-human-touch">PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst</a> was more tentative stating it won't replace the "human touch", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eschewing-generative-ai-in-favour-of-decades-of-know-how">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa</a> said the company would instead rely on "decades of know-how".</p>
<p>Just this week, PUBG maker Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-unveils-chatty-co-op-buddy-powered-by-generative-ai-thats-designed-to-play-and-talk-like-a-human-teammate">unveiled its new AI companions</a>, while voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale has discussed with Eurogamer the dangers of AI to performers</a> and why it's holding up SAG-AFTRA strike negotiations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following a festive bout of generosity with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-sim-wants-to-put-you-in-the-festive-mood-with-this-free-christmas-update">December's free PowerWash Simulator update</a>, developer FutureLab has announced the squirt 'em up's next blast of paid DLC, this time themed around Lancashire's premier Wensleydale gobblers, Wallace &amp; Gromit.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack - which FuturLab <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1875195484605964647">sneakily teased in a social media post</a> earlier this month amid praise for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0022179/wallace-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl">new movie Vengeance Most Fowl</a> - has been developed in collaboration with animation house Aardman. It'll be whisking players to the duo's home of 62 West Wallaby Street <em>and beyond</em> when it arrives later the year.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, FuturLab promises a "cracking cleaning adventure" that'll take players - hoses in hand and a deep-seated hatred of grime in their hearts - from "charming British suburbs to cheesy celestial bodies." And that's pretty much all we know about the DLC so far.

<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack - which follows similar DLC collaborations with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-heading-to-shreks-fairytale-world-this-autumn">Shrek</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wash-your-bikini-bottom-in-new-powerwash-simulator-sponge-bob-crossover">SpongBob Square Pants</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-to-the-future-cruises-into-powerwash-simulator-next-month">Back to the Future</a> - doesn't have a release date yet, but FuturLab says it's out this year and "coming soon".
</p>
<p>
It'll be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Switch, and PC when it eventually shows up, and should - based on previous DLC releases - cost around £6.50.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23-featuring-doom-south-of-midnight-and-a-surprise-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft just now <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1877354722916458694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the date for this year's Xbox Developer Direct. The annual appointment to show some of this year's first-party games coming to PC and Xbox consoles will take place on January 23 at 10 AM Pacific Time / 1 PM Eastern Time / 6 PM UK / 7 PM Central European Time via the Xbox social channels.</p>
<p>Microsoft also unveiled the game lineup that fans can expect to see showcased at the event. By far the most anticipated of the bunch is id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages. The eighth installment in the main series and the third following 2016's DOOM and 2020's DOOM Eternal will actually function as a prequel, demonstrating the origin story of the Slayer in a medieval inspired setting. PlayStation 5 users will want to tune in for this one, too, since it will be available on Sony's console as well from day one. The PC version will deliver the most advanced visuals, though, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation support and path traced graphics, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025.</p>
<p>Another game featured in the Xbox Developer Direct is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. This is a new IP from Compulsion Games, the Canadian studio behind Contrast and We Happy Few. South of Midnight features unique stop-motion-like graphics, a setting inspired by deep South folk tales, and an action/adventure framework that, however, puts the emphasis on narrative rather than gameplay. The game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch in March, and if that's the case, it will definitely be announced during this broadcast.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft is also hosting a third-party game this year. It's the intriguing <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-next-spring-with-an-incredible-voice-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a JRPG featuring a mix of turn-based combat and real-time elements in development at French studio Sandfall Interactive. The game will be available on Game Pass, which likely explains the inclusion here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Microsoft has teased a 'visit to a surprise location to see another studio's brand new game'. It's really anyone's guess as to what it could be, but we're definitely intrigued.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-ahead-of-reveal-next-week.1077972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lineup for this year's Evo tournament appears to have been leaked just a week or so before the official announcement is due to take place.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo Life <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/oops-evo-2025s-lineup-has-accidentally-been-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the official thumbnail for the upcoming livestream apparently gave away the games before seemingly being changed. It no longer features any of the participating games, instead simply depicting a plain "Evo Announcement Show" banner.</p>

<p>Obviously, this story will contain spoilers for the Evo 2025 lineup, so if you'd rather wait for the official broadcast, which is due to take place on January 14th at 8pm Eastern (that's 5pm Pacific), then make sure you don't read on. Here's an image of Evo 2024 so you can get out before it's too late!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=_8bDRs1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=c8hKlVz8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is your last chance not to be spoiled on the Evo 2025 lineup.</figcaption></figure><p>Still here? Alright then. Here are the games that were apparently featured in the Evo 2025 livestream's thumbnail before they were hastily removed.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a></li>

	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles" rel="nofollow"><em>Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></li>
</ul><p>After all that, it's a pretty straightforward lineup, featuring as it does several Evo mainstays; last year's competition also featured&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and a number of the other games on this list.</p>

<p>Two games have notably been subbed in, however:&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2&nbsp;</em>have been swapped in for&nbsp;<em>King of Fighters XV&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike</em>.</p>

<p>While you should take this lineup with a small pinch of salt until the official announcement arrives, these games were featured in the Evo 2025 stream lineup before it was changed, so they're almost certainly the games in which you'll be watching competitors duke it out.</p>

The next Switch is imminent, but it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p>The first official non-Valve device with SteamOS is set to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Lenovo’s $499 Legion Go S</a>, which launches in May. But it’s not hard to imagine a near-term future where many other hardware makers announce their own SteamOS handhelds, meaning the magic of SteamOS might be available in all kinds of interesting devices very soon. (And hopefully, the increased competition means Valve will make the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">eventual next Steam Deck</a> <em>really</em> good.)</p><div><figcaption><em>The Lenovo Legion Go S next to a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

But Nintendo is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(character)#:~:text=In%20a%20match%20against%20boxing,is%20given%20at%20800%20pounds.">800-pound gorilla</a> in the room, and as interesting as all of the PC gaming hardware is, the Switch’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">imminent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">successor</a> will almost certainly be a very compelling upgrade. The original Switch was released <em>nearly eight years ago</em>, so the successor will likely be much more powerful and will probably have splashy new games in marquee franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. (I’d bet already-announced Switch games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> will get some kind of boost on the next Switch, too.)</p><p>Right out of the gate, Nintendo’s new console will also have an enormous library. The company already announced its next console will be compatible with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">original Switch games</a> — a catalog that includes many of the indie hits that are also some of the best games on handheld PCs.</p><p>Back in 2017, when the original Switch launched, there wasn’t anything like it. The Switch’s successor will compete in a much more crowded field — and one that’s getting even more crowded after CES 2025. Hopefully, the competition means everyone makes better hardware and better games. It’s a great time for handhelds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Transformers Reactivate gameplay leaked online after Splash Damage announced the game would be canceled.</p>



<p>Uploading by the X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DpzLuna</a>, six and half minutes of footage reveal what the game would have been like. According to the watermarks, the footage was captured on March 28, 2023. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>







<p>The footage shows the player driving around in a car and seamessly transforming into a transformer to battle enemies.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Splash Damage announced that Transformers Reactivate would be canceled and that a number of roles at the company are at risk of redundancy. Splash Damage said the company would “refocus” on some of its other projects.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Transformers Reactivate was first announced on December 8, 2022, and little about the game has been heard since then.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many roles at Splash Damage have been affected, but Insider Gaming has contacted Splash Damage for comment.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Transformers Reactivate gameplay? Let us know in the comment, or join the discussion on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>Actor Jennifer Hale, who voices Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, has spoken up to share her thoughts on the upcoming Mass Effect TV series. She said in an interview that she's excited to see Mass Effect become a TV show and would love to be a part of it. She also offered a piece of advice to the team making the show that she believes could make the show even better.</p><p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do. The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!" Hale told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer.</a></p><p>She went on to say that the producers would be "really smart" to try to involve as many of the original cast members as possible in the Mass Effect TV series. Hale said she'd love to see her colleagues show up in "cameos and Easter eggs" or even recurring and regular roles.</p><p>"I think that would be an absolutely genius move," she said. "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p><p>The Mass Effect TV show was announced in 2021 but was not going anywhere until November 2024, which is when Amazon MGM Studios announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">"officially in development."</a> A show being "in development" doesn't mean it'll ever get made, though. Anything can happen in Hollywood.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">A report said</a> Daniel Casey (Fast &amp; Furious 9) is writing and executive producing the show, while EA's Michael Gamble is an executive producer as well. Ari Arad (Iron Man, Uncharted, upcoming Zelda movie) is an executive producer, too.</p><p>There are no plot details available as of yet for the Mass Effect show, but the main series follows the spacefaring events of Commander Shepard. A movie version of Mass Effect was planned at one point, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">never got off the ground.</a></p><p>BioWare veteran Mac Walters, who has since left the company, said in 2021 that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">Mass Effect TV show makes more sense than a film</a>. "If you're going to tell a story that's as fleshed out as Mass Effect, TV is the way to do it. There's a natural way it fits well with episodic content," he explained.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect game series, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">new game is now in the works now</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">BioWare's main focus currently</a> after the company released Dragon Age: The Veilguard in October 2024.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft will once again hold a Xbox Developer Direct to kick off the new year, with deep dives into a small selection of upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's next livestream will begin at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January - that's a fortnight from today.
</p>
<p>
On the schedule will be a detailed look at Doom: The Dark Ages, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game from an unknown studio. Mysterious! 
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages has been dubbed as an origin story for the series' iconic Doom Slayer from veteran developer id Software, and is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025. Will we get a date? It seems likely.
</p><p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, is the stylish-looking action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games,  set in a gothic fantasy American Deep South. It looks a treat, though also currently lacks a release date beyond "2025". Here's hoping we find out when exactly it'll arrive for PC and Xbox Series X/S very soon.</p>
<p>Next up, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This is the dark fantasy RPG from French outfit Sandfall Interactive that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">we reckon has shades of Persona and Final Fantasy</a>, plus the vocal talents of Andy Serkis and Charlie Cox. Clair Obscur isn't an Xbox Game Studios title and is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point this year.</p>
<p>And then there's that fourth game. Microsoft still has plenty on its 2025 release schedule that this could be - Fable, The Outer Wilds, even Avowed - which will be just a month away. But the secretive nature here suggests something that hasn't yet publicly been confirmed. It'll be interesting to see if internet rumours of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake bear any fruit.</p>
<p>Join us in a couple of weeks for Xbox Developer Direct, right here on Eurogamer, when we'll be reporting live.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
