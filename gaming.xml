                <p dir="ltr"><em>Left 4 Dead 2 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 17, 2024. Below, we look at how its cast and their interactions set it apart from its contemporaries and modern imitators alike.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead-2/">Left 4 Dead 2</a> has been rightfully receiving its flowers for the past 15 years. The modding community has come up with everything from visual enhancements like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121339498">improved blood textures</a> to completely user-made <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=122444796">campaigns</a>. The last two DLCs for the game, Cold Stream and The Last Stand, were made by community members and officially endorsed by Valve. At the time of writing, there are over 45,000 players in-game on PC, and (if you somehow still don't own it) you can play it for free during this anniversary weekend. As such, the Steam discussions are filled with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/550/discussions/">dozens of threads</a> about the Good Guy Nick Achievement, which can only be obtained when the game is on a free weekend, something that occurs every couple of years.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's a special legacy Left 4 Dead has left behind: Valve's shooter has been a catalyst for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">new subgenre altogether</a>. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/back-4-blood-review-reanimated/1900-6417761/">Back 4 Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-anacrusis/">The Anacrusis</a> follow the formula closely, which isn't surprising considering the development teams include people who worked on Left 4 Dead. Others, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2/">Warhammer: Vermintide</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-fireteam-elite-suicide-squad/1900-6417719/">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a> iterate on the concept of a co-op shooter by leaning closer to its own worlds, taking inspiration from existing franchises or coming up with brand-new mechanics to stand out from the rest. Yet, as more developers are taking the genre in interesting new directions, there's one crucial element that is often overlooked in these iterations.</p><p dir="ltr">The passage of time has not diminished Left 4 Dead 2's strengths. The clever "AI Director" dictating and reacting to the pace and behavior of your group to the B-movie flair embedded in every corner are standouts. But if there's one thing that entices me to return to the game, and a crucial aspect that none of the Left 4 Dead-likes have managed to achieve to a similar degree, is the cast of characters and the personality each of them oozes.</p><p dir="ltr">This was a strong suit even in the first Left 4 Dead with Zoey, Francis, Louis, and Bill. From the moment you set foot on the first rooftop on your way to Mercy Hospital, the frequent character interactions are put front and center. The quips can be further extended (on PC) by using a conversation wheel to express yourself drawing from a pool of hundreds of lines for laughing, cursing, and thanking others. While neither game was ever story-driven, you get to learn more about the characters' personalities thanks to these conversations, and how they interact with each other throughout the campaigns. As a result, I cared more for their survival within the world itself, and not just from a sole gameplay standpoint of reviving a friend during a horde rush. As time passed, I found Bill's incidental role as a parental figure to be endearing, and Francis' constant complaints became a running joke rather than making him an annoying character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400535"></a><figcaption>The cast of Left 4 Dead 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Left 4 Dead 2 took this foundation further with Nick, Coach, Rochelle, and Ellis: Some smaller details include voice command shouts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/ag00r4/left_4_dead_2_your_character_will_shout_the/" rel="nofollow ">being louder or quieter</a> when calling other characters' names depending on the distance from each other, or the iconic Easter egg in the Dark Carnival campaign where the cast sings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEs_dbZjyI">song excerpts</a> if you interact with the microphone on stage during the final fight. But there's a greater focus on highlighting the characters--unlike the first Left 4 Dead campaign, No Mercy, the group begins the sequel not knowing each other's names in Dead Center. They're eventually introduced to one another and establish a bond over the later episodes. The DLCs, as well as the integration of Left 4 Dead into Left 4 Dead 2, are proof of Valve extending the philosophy to the original cast as well, with The Passing uniting both groups in the same campaign, and The Sacrifice adding another sentimental layer as an overarching narrative involving Bill.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back at all the late nights I've had playing with friends during the past 15 years, I believe the characters are responsible for tying the whole experience together. They remain singular in nature, resulting in a sense of personality that is yet to be matched. Some jokes and banter lines, such as Nick remarking on Ellis' excitement over the carnival Kiddie Land by saying, "He's like a five-year-old, with guns and a comprehensive grasp of every swear word in the English language," and the multiple variants for friendly fire reactions like Ellis' "I am not a zombie, shoot the zombies!" never get tiresome.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands, the future of Left 4 Dead is uncertain. In 2023, people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files" rel="nofollow ">found a mention</a> of "Left4Dead3" in Counter-Strike 2's files, albeit with the downside that, according to the files, the project's priority is "none" for Valve. This follows a series of similar I Want to Believe mentions throughout the years in other titles like Half-Life: Alyx and Portal VR, including more concrete details in The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx documentary, where it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve" rel="nofollow ">revealed</a> that Left 4 Dead 3 was supposed to be an open-world game set in Morocco, only to be canceled due to game engine Source 2's unfinished status at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to know if a third entry could capture the charm and chemistry of the existing characters with a new group once more. Despite having replayed the campaigns dozens of times over the years, however, I'm still discovering interactions by the cast. And even when I'm not, joining a lobby feels like revisiting old friends at this point. Picking a character in Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't give you any different perks--each one of them can use all weapons, and their survival depends on your skills and cooperation with others alone. The game's most noteworthy achievement, then, is giving importance to that decision regardless of its importance--choosing the eyes from which to see the apocalypse through is as memorable as your efforts to make it out alive with that character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re in a pretty good moment for sprawling, complex role-playing games. New releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Dragon Age Absolution</em></a>, along with older titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">including this year’s expansion</a>), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23861883/baldurs-gate-3-ps5-technical-review"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> have sucked millions of people into their expansive worlds. They can be all-consuming experiences, offering players all kinds of freedom to explore their worlds and characters. But honestly? Sometimes I don’t want to fuss with conversation wheels or make difficult, narrative-altering choices. I just want to go on a big adventure and slowly turn into an overpowered hero fighting monsters — and that’s where the excellent new remake of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> comes in.</p><p>The game originally came out way back in 1988 (it was initially called <em>Dragon Warrior 3</em> in North America) and it has a refreshingly straightforward premise: you’re on a quest to kill a great evil that your father failed to destroy many years before. There are a few colorful characters, but there isn’t a whole lot else to it beyond a quest for revenge. This isn’t a game you play for the story. Instead, it’s about going on adventures, exploring strange and dangerous locations, and killing lots of cute blue slimes.</p><p>That simplicity has stood the test of time rather well, with systems that are easy to grasp while still offering a challenge (even if the regular battles can eventually get tedious). This is a good thing, because the remake doesn’t change all that much. The exploration and turn-based battles all still feel largely as they did. This means that the game follows a largely predictable path, as you go from one dungeon to the next, visiting towns in between to rest and gear up for the next challenge. There are some additions, like a new character class that lets you collect monsters, along with additional story scenes to flesh out the barebones narrative.</p><p>Though it’s mostly the same as the original, there are major changes to the presentation and some notable quality of life features. To start, this version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> looks incredible. It uses the same visual style as games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561880/octopath-traveler-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Octopatch Traveller</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22960053/triangle-strategy-nintendo-switch-interview"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, which Square Enix awkwardly calls “HD 2D.” Basically, these are still games with pixel art characters, but they explore incredibly detailed worlds. The developers then throw in a tilt-shift effect that gives the whole thing a diorama-like appearance. The result is a game that looks decidedly old-school, but in a slick, modern way. I especially love the adorable monster animations in battle. There’s also an updated orchestral score performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, along with all-new voice acting.</p><p>It’s more than just an aesthetic overhaul, though. The <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake also makes some very smart tweaks that often make it less frustrating to play. These include a more useful map that makes it easier to find where you’re headed, an option to speed up battles so you can grind quicker, and a handful of difficulty options. These may sound small, but they’re the kind of modern conveniences that can make many older games difficult to play, especially ones built around repetitive combat like a classic RPG. Smoothing out those few rough edges has a big impact on the overall feel of a game like <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>.</p><p>Even though it’s technically the third game of the series, this version of <em>Dragon Quest</em> is also a great place for newcomers to see what the series is all about (and really, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790204/dragon-quest-11-review-ps4-steam">things haven’t changed all that much over the years</a>). It’s a pretty, approachable way to experience an epic quest without getting overwhelmed by story or features. It’s just you, some swords and magic, and a whole lot of monsters to defeat. Sometimes, that’s all you really need.</p><p><small>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D<em> is available now on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>20 years after its 2004 debuted, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> has broken its own concurrent player record on Steam.</p>
<p>According to SteamDB, the seminal shooter has secured just over a 61.7K player peak over the weekend, the highest number of simultaneous players the game has achieved since records began in 2008.</p>
<p>In fact, the number I've just written is probably already out of date - the number is still rising and has been all day, having increased several times in the time I've been writing this.</p>

<p>Given this weekend's surprise release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, it's possible players are jumping back into the game to revel in nostalgia or possibly check out the new director's commentary. It's also possible - given Valve is currently giving away the game for free - new players are trying it for the first time.</p><p>If you haven't seen it yet, in the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">documentary now available on YouTube</a>, the Half-Life 2 development team revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-episode-3-doesnt-exist-because-left-4-dead-does">Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting Left 4 Dead "out the door"</a>.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre. "It took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have definitely gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Treyarch has enabled, disabled, and is now reintroducing legacy XP tokens in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - free and premium content, a new Zombies "experience in-season", and full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-has-so-much-content-this-infographic-hurts-our-eyes">Black Ops 6's Season 1</a> also introduced something else - legacy XP tokens.</p>
<p>Turns out the latter was an accident, though, as no sooner did players spot legacy XP tokens in the new shooter, developer Treyarch "fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed legacy XP tokens to be activated in Black Ops 6 UI".</p>

<p>"We realise how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update. This allows us time to ensure stability is maintained before we reintroduce this feature.</p><p>"In the interim, players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. Any tokens applied in Warzone will also apply to Black Ops 6 should you switch titles or modes," Treyarch concluded, before revealing we should hear more about this change "next week".</p>

            <p>As part of this weekend's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, Valve has given fans a sneak peek of the cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-3">Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a> project.</p>
<p>As well as sharing stunning concept art and gameplay prototypes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> team reunited in the documentary to talk about the development of Episode 2.</p>
<p>The developers also revealed that Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> "out the door".</p>

<p>"Left 4 Dead needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre.</p>
<p>"It was a really tight shipping schedule and it required a lot of work from everybody to get it out the door. It was worth it - I mean, Left 4 Dead came out great. But it took long enough - and this is the tragic and almost comical thing about it - it took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have <em>definitely</em> gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p>
<p>The documentary also delves into specific details like weapon design, such as the ice gun that could be used to create cover, ascend over obstructions, or provide players makeshift ledges to get down the side of mountains, and so on.</p>
<p>But at the end of documentary, Valve boss Gabe Newell admitted that one of the reasons Episode 3 never came to be was because his "personal failure was being stumped".</p>
<p>"You can't get lazy and say, oh, we're moving the story forward. [But] that's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Yes, of course, they loved the story - they love many, many aspects of it, but sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next…</p>
<p>"You know, we could have shipped it. Like, it wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. Like, I couldn't figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p>
<p>The team did, however, reflect that if Episode 3 <em>had</em> been realised, we may not have seen other sequels like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a>.</p>
<p>Newell also added that without Episodes, Dota may not have been made.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the Episodes, there'd be no such thing as Dota. I know that sounds really weird, but it was the things that we learned in developing the Episodes that led to, you know, Team Fortress 2, to more rapid updates."</p><p>The full documentary is available to watch online above. Don't forget that to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary this weekend, Valve also released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, bundling in commentary, the previously separate Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and more. Oh, and the game's free to keep over the next few days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Insomniac Games has been the bedrock for PlayStation Studios since the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>. Already in this console generation, there’s been three major game releases that have led the way for the rest of PlayStation Studios to follow, and now all of their games have been upgraded for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, patching support back in for three fairly distinct eras of game.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro vs. Insomniac –&nbsp;Spider-Man 2, R&amp;C Rift Apart and Miles Morales compared" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgB-UiaYqIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/spider-man-miles-morales-review-ps5/">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> was their first effort on PS5, a smaller game between the main numbered entries that could iterate on the superhero series, and a cross-gen release. This brought an upgrade to the late PS4-era game engine from Spider-Man –&nbsp;heck they also remastered that game at the same time – slotting in ray-tracing effects to showcase what the PS5 could do over the PS4 in that department, and using those new ray-traced reflections to really capture the essence of New York City’s many glass sky scrapers.</p>



<p>At launch it had two distinct modes, 30fps with ray tracing and 60fps without, but they quickly dipped back in to share more optimisations with players, introducing a 40fps mode for people with 120Hz screens, as well as a cut down Performance RT mode that still managed to bring in ray tracing while keeping a 60fps target. The trade offs? 1440p as opposed to 4K, and with effects quality at lower resolutions and lower densities as well.</p>

<p>PS5 Pro now has a new Performance Pro graphics mode in both Spider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales, and it’s easy to recommend. This aims to get the full fat fidelity mode at 60FPS through the use of PSSR, with all ray-tracing features enabled at their full quality. Essentially, I would expect that (without doing any pixel peeping) it’s effectively lifted the frame rate cap on fidelity mode, and is just accepting of a possibly wider dynamic resolution when needed, barely losing any tangible quality thanks to PSSR.</p>

<p>It looks pretty great, as a straightforward upgrade, though this is starting to feel like an older game now and is well within what the base PS5 can handle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5/">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a> might have arrived around half a year after the PS5’s launch, but this was already s big jump forward for Insomniac and PS5 exclusives, a real showcase for both ray tracing and the PS5’s SSD. Again, at launch it had a 30FPS ray tracing mode and 60fps without, and again, it got the same 40fps mode and performance RT after launch… and once again, Performance RT really is the go-to for most people, even if this style of shooter platformer is a very nice feeling game in fidelity mode.</p>
<p>But there’s more deeply integrated ray-tracing throughout the game world on so many more surfaces and even characters, and so the PS5 Pro offers two modes. Performance Pro is similar to Miles Morales, using PSSR to push the base PS5’s fidelity mode through at 60fps, and considering that there was enough headroom in the PS5 to already do this fidelity mode at 40fps, it’s no surprise that the PSSR assisted upgrade looks fantastic here.</p>

<p>But then there’s also a new 30fps Fidelity Pro mode and this pushes the boat out in a few key ways. One thing that can be spotted is an increase in the number of pedestrians and onlookers, filling out the crowd in the opening scene as an easy touch point, as well as some beefed up ray tracing. RT Reflections bump up from a half render resolution – so a 4K output would have 1080p reflections – to a full render resolution, and that’s also accounting for any dynamic resolutions. For comparison, the base PS5 has half render resolution for its Fidelity mode and quarter resolution for its Performance RT mode. There is significantly more clarity to the myriad shiny surfaces through the game, though there’s also a lot of distorted and scuffed up surfaces that make the reflection resolution less noticeable.</p>

<p>Added to this is RT Ambient Occlusion, which was seen in the PC version of Rift Apart. This uses ray-tracing to augment the standard Screen Space AO, bringing more realistic shading and contact shadows, helping objects blend together as a scene more naturally. It’s an interesting one, as it can make shadows more subtle in some areas and stronger in others, while the screen space global illumination bounce lets some light colour transfer, but the stylised nature of Rift Apart maybe makes this less impactful than it could have been – especially as the game was initially designed without it.</p>

<p>Both actually have separate menu options once you engage Fidelity Pro, defaulting to High quality for both effects, though you can step reflections back down to Medium, and RTAO has a Medium and an Off setting –&nbsp;medium removes the screen space GI bounce. There could be a minor frame rate benefit for those playing at 40fps on a 120Hz screen or without a frame cap using VRR, but we couldn’t test this out.</p>
<p>In general, Performance Pro is going to be the way to go here if you just have a 60Hz screen,&nbsp;just as Performance RT was for the base game. I think there’s a benefit to sharpness here over PS5, especially given the fuzzy characters that fill the cutscenes in particular and the style of reflection use throughout the game world – it’s just the right side of excess that higher quality reflections can really add to the game compared to the equivalent graphics mode on base PS5.</p>
<p>And so we come to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a>, and this game really shows the growth and maturity of ray tracing within Insomniac games. The studio really knocked it out of the park here on base PS5, going all-in and only offering Fidelity and Performance RT modes, without a fallback mode that omitted ray tracing. That naturally carries through to the PS5 Pro with both Fidelity Pro and Performance Pro modes.</p>
<p>It’s a familiar story, with PSSR helping Performance Pro get the standard Fidelity mode up to 60FPS, while Fidelity Pro bringing some additional higher quality and optional ray tracing features to the table. Of note, Fidelity Pro mode is also able to push level of detail distances out further, which is impressive given the size of the city and the open world scenes you’re often taking in.</p>

<p>The RT Reflections option from R&amp;C becomes RT Reflections &amp; Interiors here, because there’s some black dev magic at play for rendering the rooms in sky scrapers with people and everything –&nbsp;basically there’s secret rooms under the map that are rendered and processed with ray tracing. You only have Medium and High settings with the half and full render resolutions respectively.</p>
<p>Also similar to Rift Apart, there’s the three levels of RT Ambient Occlusion – off as in Performance, Medium and High, as in Fidelity –&nbsp;and it’s again augmenting screen-space AO instead of replacing it, though can provide a good deal of shadowing to a city scape scene.</p>

			</dt>
				<dd id="gallery-2-454634">
				RT Key Light Shadows Off

		</div>

<p>The Spider-Man 2 exclusive addition is RT Key Light Shadows. This, is all about the city of New York and calculating sun shadows for middle to far distance buildings, replacing the shadow maps from before, and which will be most effective for when you’re out and about and up high, looking for a perfect photo to take. Similar to RTAO, it adds a lot of depth to the image.</p>
<p>What’s nice is that, while swapping Fidelity Pro to Performance Pro requires a restart at a checkpoint, the individual RT toggles can be done without reloading. This does still mean diving into the full settings screen which covers up the game, so back-to-back comparisons in-game are difficult to make unless you take distinct screen grabs, but the main menu lets you apply them with the scenic shots of the two Spider-Men and the city.</p>
<p>Once again, these options are mainly for the tech curious, as there’s really no reason to turn them off in the 30fps Fidelity Pro mode. Again, maybe there’s an advantage to tuning things down for an improved VRR Fidelity mode? There’s more of a need or desire to play at higher frame rates here, given the action combat of Spider-Man 2, so Fidelity Pro will mainly be for those with the possibility of 40fps or better, while those using a 60Hz screen should probably play in Performance Pro.</p>
<p>Insomniac remain the absolute masters of the PS5 within PlayStation Studios. If game development is a marathon, they’ve been able to sprint through the first half of this generation, and it’s truly impressive to see how rapidly they’ve iterate and grown their game engine and confidence with ray tracing.</p>
<p>The problem for PS5 Pro is that Insomniac’s games already look fantastic on PS5, and come with enough headroom to let people engage optional frame rate modes as well. Sure, there’s compromises when going to Performance RT, such as significantly reduced reflection resolution, but they’re well enough disguised and fleeting enough not to be a detriment. PS5 Pro is able to lift away a lot of those compromises, and even introduce ray tracing features that would otherwise only feature in the PC ports.</p>

<p>The discussion of Episode 3 begins at 1h 52m, with concept art and eventually in-game footage. The in-game footage is all taken from test arenas and tech demos, not finished parts of the game. Various Valve developers say they worked on the episode for around six months, before moving over to the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, never to return.
</p><p>There are two main features of the episode discussed. The ice gun let you create geometry by spraying ice, so you could create impromptu cover to hide behind, which soldiers would shoot through and eventually smash. You could also use it directly as a weapon to freeze enemies, or in what is described as a "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silver">Silver</a> Surfer mode", to extrude an ice path in front of yourself as you slid along it.
</p>
<p>An ice gun is thematically appropriate given Episode 3 was due to take place (at least in part) in the Arctic, as Freeman headed to the icebreaker ship Borealis referebced in Episode 2 (and initially planned as a setting for Half-Life 2).
</p>
<p>More interesting is the new enemy type, called "the blobs", which is a descriptive name. They are blobs, like liquid droplets, which can change shape, separate, and sluice around environments. They could absorb other enemies or physics objects, and squeeze (or fall) through grates. 
</p>
<p>It's anyones guess whether these elements would have made it through to a release version of Episode 3, or whether the blobs would have been fun to fight. They certainly look cool, though.
</p>
<p>"I still don't know what that would have been if we'd built it, because it hadn't been built," writer Marc Laidlaw says. "That was the feeling of excitement, of something I can't even imagine is going to happen as a team. I was not imposing a top-down, 'This is what we must do to tell our very important tale.' Y'know, it's like - we have new features? What kind of story can we do with these now?"
</p><p>Laidlaw eventually published a short story telling a version of Episode 3 as essentially fanfiction, though <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-narrative-had-to-be-baked-into-the-corridors-marc-laidlaw-on-writing-half-life">later told us he regretted the decision</a>. "I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do... until I did it."
</p>
<p>Several Valve employees in the docuemntary offer their own takes on why they never continued with Episode 3. Fatigue after working within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> for so long, doubt about the concept of episodic games, a feeling that they needed to 'go bigger' with the next instalment, excitement about other projects being developed internally including multiplayer games. Several also say that it was a mistake - that they could have and should have gone back to working on it, in retrospect.
</p>
<p>"You can't get lazy and say, 'We're moving the story forward.' That's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Yes, of course they love the story, they love many, many aspects of it. But saying the reason to do it is that people want to know what happens next-- y'know, we could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard," says Gabe Newell. 
</p>
<p>"The failure was, my personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."
</p>
<p>I don't think it's lazy to resolve a story you ended on a cliffhanger. I'm also not sure if developers have an obligation to gamers, but if they do, it's presumably <em>more</em> of a cop out to not make a follow-up at all, thus fully abdicating the responsibility to innovate. On the other hand, it's hard to argue against the ethos that produced Half-Life and Half-Life 2 in the first place, and the several fantastic games in different series that Valve would make in lieu of Episode 3.</p><p>The whole anniversary documentary is worth watching, if you're a Half-Life obsessive like me. There's brief footage in there of Arkane's abandoned <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ravenholm">Ravenholm</a> project, near the end, for example. Valve have also uploaded some separate videos to their YouTube channel, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU4yPEFXzo0">a SIGGRAPH demo from 2000</a>, a never-before-seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CoMdbnJwvE">cancelled E3 2002 demo</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaHtOISsLT4">the E3 2003 demo that eventually went ahead</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> just turned 20 years old, and to celebrate Valve have released an update for their classic first-person shooter. In brief: they've recorded developer commentary; they've added Steam Workshop support; Episodes One and Two are now part of the package; and there are some bug fixes and new graphics options.
</p>
<p>Grab it before the end of the weekend (November 18th at 6pm GMT) and it's also free to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">on Steam</a>.
</p>

<p>Episodes 1 and 2 already had developer commentary, as do several other Valve games, but Half-Life 2 never did. This update adds three and a half hours of commentary by members of the Half-Life 2 team, as they try to remember what the heck happened during the making of the game.
</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the story of Half-Life 2's development, the answer is: a lot happened. Valve also partnered with Secret Tape to produce a two-hour documentary on the subject:

<p>Half-Life 2 had a bustling modding community back when, just as its predecessor did, and it's great that Steam Workshop support has been added even if it's late. (Steam Workshop itself was only created in 2011.) It's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/220/workshop/">already filling up with work now</a>.
</p><p>The full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001">fixes and rendering options</a> is too long for me to include here. There are changes to support ultrawide monitors and high FOV settings, increased spawn points in multiplayer maps to thwart players who are a quickdraw with a toilet, and some limits lifted within BSP files allowing for modders to place more brushes and models within their own levels.
</p>
<p>Valve did a similar set of revisions <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-is-steam-deck-verified-with-new-multiplayer-maps-for-its-25th-anniversary">to celebrate the original Half-Life's 25th anniversary last year</a><a></a>. Next year will be the 20th anniversary of Day Of Defeat: Source, so I'm looking forward to the three hour-long documentary about that.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> players are still struggling to import their world states despite the issue being flagged to BioWare and EA over a week ago.</p>
<p>Regardless of what platform you're playing on, it seems some players can only see default world states.</p>
<p>EA community manager <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14240306/highlight/true#M86201">EA_Shepard acknowledged the issue</a> on the official forums 10 days ago, saying the team was "aware and investigating". Shepard also validated another issue, this one with the Golden Nug, which goes AWOL mid-playthrough or disappears entirely for some.</p>

<p>Revealing that they "reported this [to the studio] at the end of the week last week and checked up on this", EA_Shepard recently confirmed that it was "still an open issue" and the team "is still working on this one".</p>
<p>The issue has apparently been further compounded by some players getting confused "around the world state importing into their game".</p>
<p>"When you import your world state, it will say default world state. The name does not change," Shepard explained.</p>
<p>"When you want to import a world state, rename it in the Keep first, import it in the Keep, and then start a new game," they added, acknowledging that when they tried it themselves on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, only one was successfully imported.</p><p>Shepard also confirmed that there "are ways to try to get it resolved by manually choosing the options and creating entirely new world states after you sync and replay the keep", but acknowledged this "has not worked for all players".</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week, Shepard shared a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14259708/highlight/true#M86454">further</a> update.</p>
<p>"Wanted to let you know I am still looking out for this one," they said. "I know the whole 'we are working on it' message gets old. Believe me, I get it! There is a lot happening and being worked on with Dragon Age so things are a bit slower on other fronts. I am watching it closely though so I have not forgotten about the community!"</p>
<p>"I get that Veilguard support is prioritised at the moment since it's a brand new game, and Keep has always been kinda buggy, but I think I speak for all of us when I ask that this issue be made more of a priority," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14262923/highlight/true#M86492">said</a> one player.</p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard? Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>.</p>
<p>"From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Hiroyuki Kotani, the producer behind PATAPON, has partnered with Tokyo Virtual Theory to announce RATATAN. RATATAN is a rhythmic roguelike where players use instruments and the rhythmical beat of the music to fight enemies. It has been confirmed to coming out in 2025, and will be releasing on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HR9r-LXLGnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>RATATAN’s roguelike element comes from the fact that after each battle players are rewarded with different power ups and awards, with these changing on each run. These power ups and rewards are given to the little Cobuns who accompany the Ratatan, which can be used in the various trials and battles they will face. The Ratatan have their own unique abilities too which will require players to switch between them to tackle different puzzles.</p>
<p>Game Source Entertainment, a Hong Kong based publisher, will be publishing RATATAN.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/vtm-bloodlines-rtx-remix-mod-alpha-0-0-1-released-on-the-games-20th-anniversary/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vtm-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-rtx-remix-mod-alpha-0-0-1-released-on-the-game%E2%80%99s-20th-anniversary.1037658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/vtm-bloodlines-rtx-remix-mod-alpha-0-0-1-released-on-the-games-20th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today marks the twentieth anniversary since the release of VtM - Bloodlines, the beloved first-person roleplaying game set in the World of Darkness. Developed by the short-lived Troika Games, it was designed by some of the minds behind the first two Fallout games and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura: Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason Anderson.</p>
<p>The game's development was not at all easy due to milestone delays that eventually brought the project over its intended budget. Publisher Activision ultimately demanded a release candidate to ship the game no matter what, but Troika had only managed to do a few weeks of testing.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this greatly affected the game's polish. VtM - Bloodlines was the quintessential gem in the rough, widely praised for its story, characters, and overall writing, while also being a bug-ridden fest. Despite the overall positive reception (it was rated 80% on Metacritic by critic reviews), sales were heavily disappointing. Following the game's launch, Troika tried to secure funding for its next project which would have marked a return to the creators' post-apocalyptic roots, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The company was forced to lay off its employees in late 2024 and shut down for good on February 24, 2005.</p>
<p>As for VtM - Bloodlines, over time, it became even more of a cult classic, ultimately leading to the development of a sequel (which had even more problems than the original, though). Bloodlines 2 is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for the first half of 2025, but in the meantime, you can download the freshly released R<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-toolkit-updated-by-nvidia-with-many-qol-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TX Remix</a> Alpha 0.0.1 mod to celebrate the 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>NVIDIA's remastering tool brings the visuals into 2024 with the power of remastered assets and path tracing, although of course, there are caveats. Only a small portion of the game has been fully remastered, and there are many bugs, which is in keeping with the game's tradition.</p>
<p><em><strong>What's in this release:</strong></em><br>
<em>-The Haven Apartments in Santa Monica. Full texture and model remaster proof of concept!</em><br>
<em>Every prop and texture in the actual apartment rooms themselves, including the players room and adjacent 2 enterable apartments! Though at the 11th hour a few of them stopped displaying correctly...</em></p>
<p><em>99% of models are replaced with from scratch built models and retextured built to the proportions of the original assets.</em></p>
<p><em>99% of Textures inside the pawnshop apartment areas have been retextured using hi poly meshes for initial bakes for shape and normal info, then retextured using Substance Designer and Toolbag 4/5's texturing suite.</em></p>
<p><em>-A rough emissive and lighting pass on the rest of the game</em><br>
<em>VtM: Bloodlines uses the alpha channel as an emissive mask for many textures in the game. I did a rough pass of converting these to emissive maps and applying them to their corresponding textures. So now the things that should light up, should light up. (And some that shouldn't!) These emissive maps will get replaced when I remaster the individual textures fully.</em></p>
<p>Below, you'll find a few comparison screens.</p>

And given what studio co-founder Gabe Newell has to say on the subject in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">2-hour documentary</a> that the company released in tandem with the update, it seems less likely than ever that we’ll be seeing either follow-up anytime soon.</p><p>Newell explains what he calls his “personal failure” near the end of the video (<a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=7078">at this timestamp</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>You can’t get lazy and say, “oh, we’re moving the story forward.” That’s copping out of your obligatiion to gamers, right? Yes, of course they love the story. They love many, many aspects of it. But sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... you know, we could’ve shipped it, like, it wouldn’t have been that hard. You know, the failure was — my personal failure was being stumped. Like, I couldn’t figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward.</p></blockquote></div><p>That’s not to say the company didn’t try<em>. </em>One idea for <em>Episode 3</em> included an “Ice Gun” that Engineer David Speyrer says in the documentary would’ve let players spray “amorphous shapes” that could serve as barriers, platforms, or even “Silver Surfer mode” paths that they would shoot in front of themselves to cross gaps. Speyrer also talks about “blob” enemies that could move through grates or split into smaller “head-crabby things.” </p><p>But Speyrer and other Valve employees featured in the video echo Newell’s sentiment that they just couldn’t come up with ideas that seemed worth a new <em>Half-Life</em> game. One of its level designers said something similar in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">2020 <em>IGN</em> interview</a>. He also blamed “scope creep” — the tendency of a project to slowly grow beyond its original plan — and the company wanting to get going on developing the Source 2 engine that drives VR prequel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>. </p><p>“Newell sees <em>Half-Life 2 </em>as an engine, a platform, or at best a whole industry unto itself,” gaming journalist Geoff Keighley, who Newell <a href="https://www.theringer.com/video-games/2022/12/8/23498936/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-video-games-oscars">once gave a key card</a> for Valve’s studios and told to “do whatever you want,” <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/">wrote for <em>Gamespot</em></a><em> </em>in 2016.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-handheld-what-i-want-to-see-from-microsofts-portable-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">Xbox boss Phil Spencer once again mentioned that an Xbox handheld</a> is potentially in the works, but that it is still a few years out. While that timeline sucks, it does mean Microsoft has time to really make it into something awesome that can compete with top-end <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc">handheld gaming PCs</a> like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-x-review">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we do know is that Phil Spencer has gone on record saying he “think(s) being able to play games locally is really important”, which suggests that any Xbox handheld that comes out won’t follow the same playbook as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">PlayStation Portal</a>, which could only play games streamed from your PS5. Unfortunately, that’s about all we really know about what the handheld console would actually be, but that doesn’t mean I can’t sit here and dream about what I’d like to see out of a potential Xbox handheld, even if I do have to wait a couple years to get my hands on it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Run Windows, But Make it Controller-Friendly</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s face it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-console-release-dates-in-order">Xbox consoles</a> become more like Windows 11 every single day – hell, there’s even ads on the home screen now – so why not go all the way and make the presumptive Xbox handheld run Windows 11. This would open up the platform to hundreds of games that the Xbox Series X simply can’t run, plus, it would allow (or force) Microsoft to create a version of Windows 11 that’s navigable with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-controller">controller</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has certainly created weird one-off UIs for Windows before. After all, this is the same company that created Windows RT, plus versions of Windows 7 and 8 that ran on Windows phones – remember those? It could be argued that all of those disparate versions of Windows were complete disasters, but as long as it’s optional, it could be a great way for Microsoft to get more Windows users, while also letting people that don’t like navigating a traditional desktop ignore the more arcane elements of Windows 11. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/gs1ioj2wcaax-he-1721386723939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Make the Gamepad-Friendly Windows UI Downloadable on Any System</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If Microsoft makes its Xbox handheld a Windows device with a gamepad-friendly UI – and that’s a big if – it would be super cool if it would also make it available for anyone to implement on their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>. I personally have a gaming PC set up in my living room, and I have to have a keyboard and mouse nearby to use it, especially when I’m trying to play a game that’s not on Steam. A controller-friendly Windows UI would do wonders there. It would also make using handheld gaming PCs much easier, now that more of them come running Windows 11. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manufacturers like Asus and Lenovo have created ways to navigate the operating system with the controllers, but they’re not <em>awesome.</em> Essentially, both of them have ways to emulate mouse input when you’re interacting with the desktop. This works most of the time, but there have definitely been times where it’s stopped working for one reason or another and I’ve had to fumble around with a touchscreen, and Windows 11 is notoriously awful for touch displays. I’m no engineer, so I don’t know how hard it’d be to implement, but I’d love to have a toggle somewhere in Windows 11 settings to enable a ‘controller mode.’ </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/24/gettyimages-1233352115-1700844269665.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Don’t Lock It Down to the Windows Store or Xbox Store</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason an Xbox handheld running on Windows 11 instead of a standalone operating system would be appealing is because it’d let you run whatever you wanted, rather than just what’s on the Xbox Store. Letting people play any game they own on Steam, Epic, or one of the countless PC gaming platforms would be incredible. I don’t know about you, but these days, I just want to play my game on whatever device I’m using at any given moment, and the more open the Xbox handheld’s OS is, the more it’ll let me do that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has already indulged my need to play games on a billion little devices with its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play Anywhere</a> program that essentially lets you buy a game on PC and then play it on Xbox Series X, with your saves carrying over. The problem is that it only supports certain first-party games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Microsoft has it locked to the Xbox store by default, at least give us access to the BIOS so we can install an unlocked version of Windows ourselves. It took Microsoft a few years to learn that lesson with Windows 10S and RT, let’s hope that it applies those lessons to the Xbox handheld, too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/11/16/xbox-series-1605567051768.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Quick Resume</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing that keeps me playing games on the Xbox Series X instead of my gaming PC is Quick Resume. There’s something to be said about having multiple games that are essentially suspended, that you can swap between at will. This is awesome when you’re stuck on a boss and you want to take a break with a different game, then come back with a clear head without losing any progress. I want that on Windows, especially for a handheld system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, when you put a gaming PC in sleep mode while it’s running a game, that game will still be running when you wake it up. This is essentially what happens when you tap the power button on your ROG Ally. However, it’s not perfect, and there are times where things will break in your game when you wake your system from sleep. So, the capability is technically there for something like Quick Resume, it would just need to be implemented. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/rog-ally-x-6-1721422488016.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Wait for More Powerful Hardware</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the AMD Z1 Extreme is awesome for handheld gaming PCs, we’re still waiting for AMD to create a next-generation version of it. What makes the Z1 special is that it’s specially engineered for the needs of a handheld gaming system. It has awesome graphics performance, but doesn’t draw too much power, allowing you to play games on battery for a few hours. The trade-off, though, is that it’s not great at moving above 1080p on medium settings in most games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AMD Z1 Extreme is using a Zen 4 CPU core, along with an RDNA 3 GPU core. We already have Zen 5 processors on the market, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, but we’re still waiting for RDNA 4 to show up. With how late in the year we are, my bet is that AMD will show off its next-generation graphics tech at CES 2025. If that happens, we should see the Z2, or its equivalent, some time in mid-to-late 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft being Microsoft, though, it’s entirely possible that it could work with a chipmaker like AMD to create custom silicon to bring the Xbox handheld to the next level, which would make it stand out in a market that’s becoming increasingly saturated with new handhelds all the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

<p>It’s not every day that we receive a competent “Battlefield-killer,” though Delta Force, from developer Team Jade, is shaping up to take on the crown with its free-to-play first-person shooter. From what we played during past beta periods, it’s an exceptionally good time, with fast-paced, satisfying ground combat, high-speed vehicle encounters, and customization options that keep us grinding for more weapon XP round after round.

Developer Team Jade revealed it’s targeting a Q1 2025 console release for the free-to-play first-person shooter. </p>



<p>Alongside the console release, PC players will receive full controller support.</p>

<p>When Delta Force is finally available on all systems—PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S—it will feature cross-progression between each platform, allowing you to download and play anywhere you want.

As Steam was on the rise and digital distribution was clearly to become the future of gaming, a Polish company that had just released its first game—a relatively obscure RPG called <em>The Witcher</em>—wanted to get in on the act. The goal was updating and preserving classic gaming, and selling it without any form of DRM. Over the years, GOG seemed to drift away from this origin, and shift its focus to trying to compete as a distribution platform for AAA gaming, going head-to-head with Valve’s behemoth. But today marks a big change. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="448291c8c64307337f81b8c914668202" data-recommend-id="image://448291c8c64307337f81b8c914668202" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A head crab zombies shambles toward the player." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A head crab zombies shambles toward the player." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Orbifold / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="448291c8c64307337f81b8c914668202" data-recommend-id="image://448291c8c64307337f81b8c914668202" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A head crab zombies shambles toward the player." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-rtx-mods-release-date-nvidia-pc-1850762462&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-rtx-mods-release-date-nvidia-pc-1850762462">Nvidia announced that a group of talented modders</a></span> were working on fully remastering <em>Half-Life 2,</em> including adding new textures, models, and ray-traced visuals.

<p>It’s been a big year for video games, with countless hits, such as The Outlast Trials, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Elden Ring’s first and only expansion, and numerous indie titles that stole the show, but the year isn’t over yet. There’s still one month to go, and it’s often the big one. December is typically filled with a few significant releases to prepare for the holiday season and countless sales to capitalize on Christmas. For now, let’s focus on the games. Here are the biggest video game releases of December 2024!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-major-video-game-release-in-december">Every Major Video Game Release in December</h2>



<p>Honestly speaking, this December is a little more lackluster than usual. We don’t have as many high-profile releases to discuss, besides Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. While I’m excited to play all three, Caves of Qud steals the month for me, and I’ll probably lose myself to another few playthroughs of that one.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete (iOS / Android) – December 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force (PC) – December 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Caves of Qud (PC) – December 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fantasian Neo Dimension (PS4 / PS5) – December 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals (PC / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – December 6</strong></li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (PC / Xbox Series X|S) – December 9</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered (PC / Switch / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – December 10</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – December 10</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fairy Tail 2 (PC) – December 11</strong></li>



<li><strong>Alien: Rogue Incursion (PSVR2 / PC VR / Quest 3) – December 19</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-a-taste-of-what-s-to-come-in-january">A Taste of What’s to Come in January</h2>



<p>Of course, as you start to get older, you’ll find that the months begin to blend as one moves into the next rapidly. Before you know it, the holidays end, and January and the new year begin, so there will be plenty of new video game releases!</p>



<p>Here’s a taste of the upcoming game releases in January 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana (PS4 / PS5 / Switch) – January 7</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (Switch) – January 16</li>



<li>Tales of Graces f Remastered (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – January 17</li>



<li>Dynasty Warriors: Origins (PC / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – January 17</li>



<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (PC) – January 30</li>



<li>Sniper Elite: Resistance (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – January 30</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-rockstar-chases-bigger-better-more-immersive-worlds.1037526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rockstar-chases-bigger-better-more-immersive-worlds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been 23 years since Rockstar Games pioneered the 3D open world with Grand Theft Auto 3 and ever since that industry-shifting release the studio has remained at the very forefront of the genre. Despite there being more contenders to the throne than ever these days, Rockstar’s worlds have consistently proven themselves to be generational leaders largely thanks to the pursuit of immersive realism. The network of overlapping systems and handcrafted elements that make up places like Los Santos and Saint Denis are designed to offer such a sense of authenticity that these simulated cities truly feel alive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The craft behind such digital realities is something that Ben Hinchliffe knows well. A former Rockstar designer now working in the immersive field of virtual reality, he helped put together the worlds of L.A. Noire, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 – games that each pushed the bar higher and higher. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/la-noire-1731677045841.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">L.A. Noire's facial capture tech made conversations feel very realistic (if quite uncanny) Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For 2011’s L.A. Noire, much of that immersion came via its groundbreaking facial capture technology that was able to recreate an actor’s every sneering lip and twitching eye. It’s the feature that liquidated developer Team Bondi will be best remembered for. But Rockstar, who acted as both publisher and co-developer on the project, offered contributions that were informed by its proven strengths in open world design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s something that will no doubt raise a few eyebrows, as L.A. Noire is widely considered a poor open world game due to its lack of side activities and map-populating content. “Because the focus was on Phelps and the police, you were kind of boxed in a little bit,” says Hinchliffe. “How far would Phelps go and what could he do? He couldn't do anything too outrageous. He's law enforcement. It did shape a lot of the content as to where we could take it. Let's say you were a criminal or an outlaw, you probably could have gotten away with a lot more in terms of content and what you could have done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, L.A. Noire’s approach to a sprawling city was closer to Grand Theft Auto’s guiding philosophy than you may expect. It was all about <em>authenticity</em>, something that has only become increasingly important to the studio over the last decade.  “[The aim was] trying to get that vibe of the 1940s era and the setting and making sure that all felt very authentic in terms of how it was portrayed throughout the game,” explains Hinchliffe. L.A. Noire’s achievements in this area are largely uncontested thanks to a recreation of the city of angels that is so period-accurate even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/night-and-the-city" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who lived in LA during the 1940s praised its depiction</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even the hand scripted stuff looks like it's organic because of Rockstar's tools</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reflection of that authentic, painstaking-recreated LA would later be found in Grand Theft Auto 5’s Los Santos, which features large sections of city streets that are map-accurate to the metropolis that inspired it. But realism isn’t achieved by architectural accuracy alone – people are as important as pavements. Hinchliffe worked on several of L.A. Noire’s random crimes, a human element that helped bring the digital city to life. There were mobsters lurking in the backalleys that didn’t care about the main story, and you’d never know when they’d strike next. They lent some authentic everyday frustration to the job of a detective – would you focus on the case, or do your public duty and clean up another one of the city’s messes?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those random crimes would indirectly evolve into Grand Theft Auto 5’s world events, in which pedestrians would call out for help after being mugged or carjacked. They appeared as part of Rockstar’s mandate to “go bigger and better in every aspect.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was making the cars feel like they handled better, having better damage on the vehicles, having the tyres deflate and stuff, having everything react more realistically,” recalls Hinchliffe. “It was a grand vision of just pushing everything forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key to enhancing GTA 5’s immersive qualities were the dozens and dozens of automated systems that made its simulation of city life feel truly organic. A tyre bursting was a natural reaction to a player’s driving habits rather than a scripted sequence. But Rockstar learned that sometimes it took a lie to create something that feels like the truth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/gta-5-1731677294732.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 5's traffic behaviour could be hand-crafted to create immersive, cinematic situations. Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinchliffe worked on The Meltdown, a mission in which you must help paparazzi photographer Beverly Felton score a picture of a drunken celebrity caught in a police chase. To create an authentic race through the streets of Los Santos, Hinchliffe controlled <em>everything</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the traffic in that chase is fully hand-scripted,” he says. “It's not ambient traffic. We've made the cars follow a set route and cross over at the set time, and have a garbage truck just pull around the corner at the right time. We've hand scripted all of it to give the player the best experience and the best cinematic feel for that chase.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar’s systems are very clever,” he adds. “The tools are very powerful for design. You can switch between hand scripted and generic behaviors very easily, and even the hand scripted stuff looks like it's organic because of the tools.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That approach really comes into its own in Red Dead Redemption 2. While the 2018 western is Rockstar’s most simulation-heavy open world to date, much of its authenticity only exists because the world is so authored. The frontier may feel alive and reactive, but behind the scenes are thousands of hand-crafted responses to the many actions players can perform. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/rdr-2-1731677309650.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Red Dead Redemption 2's conversation system gave impressive, authentic life to every NPC. Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“A big aspect of Red Dead 2 was that the higher ups wanted to push forward that feeling of the NPCs feeling more real and make that world around you feel like a living, breathing world,” Hinchliffe recalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You've got these smaller towns and less of a population density, so you need the NPCs to feel a bit more real,” he explains. “It was a big drive to [allow players] to talk to people and be more involved in the world, to make you feel bad if you just shoot a random person. [Because of that conversation system] maybe you'd feel a bit worse about that than just mowing down 20 people in GTA 5.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much every NPC in Red Dead Redemption 2 has some kind of interior life. Even if that life is just riding a cargo wagon along the same route over and over, it’s a job with a destination that players can turn into a highway robbery opportunity. This level of detail is vital for Red Dead Redemption because of the limited population density Hinchliffe mentioned. At the modern metropolitan scale of Grand Theft Auto, though, with its streets home to thousands of pedestrians, such a sense of authentic life is much more difficult to achieve. It feels like a pipe dream to expect the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 to replicate RDR 2’s immersive achievements… but that’s not to say it’s impossible. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't see any reason why you couldn't have that Red Dead Redemption 2 level of NPC interaction in a much larger scale game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinchliffe worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 until he left Rockstar in 2022, which means he both knows the scope of its ambition and is bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement to keep that scope a secret. But as a veteran designer of open world games, he has his own informed opinions about what is possible.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From a theoretical standpoint, and what you might be able to do if you had the budget and the team size, I don't see any reason why you couldn't have that [Red Dead Redemption 2] level of NPC interaction in a much larger scale game,” he says.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such interactions are not where his current priorities lie, though. Hinchliffe now works at British indie developer Just Add Water, acting as lead designer on virtual reality construction simulator Dig VR. In many ways it’s a galaxy away from his experiences at Rockstar, but there is an element that unites his past and present: immersion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“VR just adds another level of immersion by default because you're in the space,” Hinchliffe says. “But it's harder to then make the player feel like they're immersed and that place is real because they're <em>in </em>it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously VR is super tactile,” he continues. “You are using your hands in most stuff, and the challenge is making sure that the things you are doing with your hands or anything you interact with feels real. If it doesn't, you can instantly break the immersion.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those challenges really highlight two very different approaches to immersion. Where in GTA it’s all about the detailed city-wide simulation, in VR it’s about physically turning the key in the ignition. It’s smaller, more intimate. That requires a complete reset of your expectations and ambitions when compared to traditional gaming. That goes for much more than just immersion, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A huge achievement for us [in Dig VR] was getting the dynamic terrain working so you can fully dig the ground and then dump it out,” he explains. “That's a first for any Meta Quest game. Now, people in the traditional flat screen world are going ‘Whoop-de-do, you've done dynamic terrain. There's like a million games with dynamic terrain. What's the big deal?’ But for us in VR, that's a huge deal because there was no reference point, no one to learn from. We just had to figure that out and make it work.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The current state of virtual reality feels like a repeat of traditional gaming’s infancy. Because the medium is so different, everything demands starting from scratch. And so Dig VR’s achievements are literally groundbreaking. Furthermore, it may inspire other VR developers to incorporate dynamic terrain in their projects. “It's those baby steps of helping each other and helping the medium go forwards,” says Hinchliffe. “As each game comes out with a new feature that hasn't been done in VR, the whole space starts iterating and moving forwards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">23 years ago, Rockstar transformed its Scalextric-esque 2D roads into a fully three-dimensional city. It pushed the industry forwards, paving the way not just for its own games but laying the groundwork for the likes of Assassin’s Creed, Forza Horizon, and Cyberpunk 2077. The open world genre is now a patchwork of different developer contributions, each one having iterated and moved the concept forward. And next year, with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll finally see what Rockstar’s next contribution to immersive worlds will be.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. <br>Views expressed in this interview are the personal opinions of Ben Hinchliffe and do not represent the thoughts or opinions of Rockstar Games. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>It's&nbsp;</em>Half-Life 2<em>&nbsp;week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of&nbsp;</em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>“Well, I just hate the idea that our games might waste people’s time. Why spend four years of your life building something that isn't innovative and is basically pointless?”</p>
<p>Valve software founder Gabe Newell is quoted by Geoff Keighley—yes, the Game Awards guy, back then a GameSpot writer—as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/"><span>saying this in June 1999</span></a>, six months after the original <i>Half-Life</i> launched. Newell gave his team no real budget or deadline, only the assignment to “follow up the best PC game of all time” and redefine the genre.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2004/12/hl2/"><i>Half-Life 2</i> arrived in November 2004</a>, the Collector’s Edition contained about 2.6GB of files. The game, however, contained so many things that would seem brand new in gaming, or just brave, that it’s hard to even list them.</p>
<p><span>Except I’m going to try that right here. Some will be hard to pin definitively in time to <i>Half-Life 2</i> (<i>HL2</i>). But like many great games, <i>HL2</i> refined existing ideas, borrowed others, and had a few of its own to show off.</span></p>
<p>Note that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">some aspects of the game itself</a>, its status as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">Steam’s big push title</a>, and what it’s like to play it today, are covered by other writers during Ars’ multi-day celebration of the game’s 20th anniversary. That includes the Gravity Gun.</p>

<h2>The Source Engine</h2>
<p>It’s hard to imagine another game developer building an engine with such a forward-thinking mission as Source. Rather than just build the thing that runs their next game, Valve crafted Source to be modular, such that its core could be continually improved (and shipped out over Steam), and newer technologies could be optionally ported into games both new and old, while not breaking any older titles working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Source started development during the late stages of the original <i>Half-Life</i>, but its impact goes far beyond the series. <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i>, <i>Portal 1/2,</i> and <i>Left 4 Dead</i>, from Valve alone, take up multiple slots on lists of the all-time best games. <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, <i>Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines</i>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_%28game_engine%29#Notable_games_using_Source"><span>a whole lot of other games</span></a> used Source, too. Countless future game developers, level designers, and mod makers cut their teeth on the very open and freely available Source code tools.</p>

<h2>A shooter with family dynamics</h2>
<p>Novelist Marc Laidlaw has made it clear, multiple times, that he did not truly create the <i>Half-Life</i> story when he joined Valve; it was “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-narrative-had-to-be-baked-into-the-corridors-marc-laidlaw-on-writing-half-life"><span>all there when I got there, in embryo</span></a>,” he told Rock Paper Shotgun. Laidlaw helped the developers tell their story through level design and wrote short, funny, unnerving dialogue.</p>
<p>For <em>Half-Life 2</em>, Laidlaw and the devs were tasked with creating some honest-to-goodness characters, something you didn’t get very often in first-person shooters (they were all dead in 1994’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/"><span><i>System Shock</i></span></a>). So in walked that father/daughter team of Eli and Alyx Vance, and the extended Black Mesa family, including folks like Dr. Kleiner.</p>
<p>These real and makeshift family members gave the mute protagonist Gordon Freeman stakes in wanting to fix the future. And Laidlaw’s “basic dramatic unit” set a precedent for lots of shooty-yet-soft-hearted games down the road: <i>Mass Effect, The Last of Us, Gears of War, Red Dead Redemption,</i> and far more.</p>

      Remember when a Boston-area medical manufacturing firm, run by a <em>Half-Life</em> fan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/mysterious-black-mesa-website-says-its-not-secretly-working-on-half-life-3/">got everyone thinking a sequel was coming?</a> Fun times.

      </figure>

<h2>Intense speculation about what Valve is actually doing</h2>
<p>Another unique thing Laidlaw helped develop in PC gaming: intense grief and longing for a sequel that both does and does not exist, channeled through endless speculation about Valve's processes and general radio silence.</p>
<p><i>Half-Life 2</i> got “Episodes” but never a true numbered <i>Half-Life 3</i> sequel. The likelihood of <i>3</i> took a hit when Laidlaw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/half-life-1-2-writer-answers-fans-hl3-question-by-announcing-retirement/"><span>unexpectedly announced his retirement in January 2016</span></a>. Then it got even less likely, or maybe just sad, when Laidlaw posted a barely disguised “snapshot of a dream” of “<i>Epistle 3</i>” to his blog (since deleted and later <a href="https://pastebin.com/q9DMFa7c"><span>transposed on Pastebin</span></a>).</p>
<p>Laidlaw has expressed regret about this move. Fans have expressed regret that <i>Half-Life 3</i> somehow seems even less likely, having seen Valve’s premiere writer post such a seemingly despondent bit of primary source fan fiction.</p>
<p>“Fans of popular game eager for sequel” isn't itself a unique thing, but it is for <i>Half-Life 3</i>’s quantum existence. Valve published <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/publications"><span>its new employee handbook</span></a> from around 2012 on the web, and in it, you can read about the company’s boldly flat structure. To summarize greatly: Projects only get started if someone can get enough fellow employees to wheel their desks over and work on it with them. The company doesn’t take canceled or stalled games to heart; in its handbook, it’s almost celebrated that it killed <i>Prospero</i> as one of its first major decisions.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>So the fact that <i>Half-Life 3</i> exists only as something that hasn’t been formally canceled is uniquely frustrating. <i>HL2</i>’s last (chronological) chapter left off on a global-scale cliffhanger, and the only reason a sequel doesn’t exist is because too many other things are more appealing than developing a new first-person shooter. If <i>you</i> worked at Valve, you tell yourself, maybe you could change this! Maybe.</p>

<h2>Source code leak drama</h2>
<p>The Wikipedia pages “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_video_games_with_available_source_code"><span>List of commercial video games with available source code</span></a>” and its cousin “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_video_games_with_later_released_source_code"><span>Later released source code</span></a>” show that, up until 2003, most of the notable games whose source code became publicly available were either altruistic efforts at preservation or, for some reason, accidental inclusions of source code on demos or in dummy files on the game disc.</p>
<p>And then, in late 2003, Valve and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/"><span><em>Half-Life</em> superfan Axel Gembe hacked into Valve’s servers</span></a>, grabbed the <i>Half-Life 2</i> source code that existed at the time and posted it to the web. It not only showed off parts of the game Valve wanted to keep under wraps, but it showed just how far behind the game’s development was relative to the release date that had blown by weeks earlier. Valve’s response was typically atypical: they acknowledged the source code as real, <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/news/posts/1065132052.html"><span>asked their biggest fans for help</span></a>, and then released the game a year later, to critical and commercial success.</p>
<p>The leak further ensconced Valve as a different kind of company, one with a particularly dedicated fanbase. It also seems to have taught companies a lesson about hardening their servers and development environments. Early builds of games still leak—witness <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/full-dev-build-of-space-marine-2-leaks-and-players-are-already-leveling-up/"><span><i>Space Marine 2</i> this past July</span></a>—but full source code leaks, coming from network intrusions, are something you don’t see quite so often.</p>
<h2>Pre-loading a game before release</h2>
<p>It would be hard to go back in time and tell our pre-broadband selves about pre-loading. You download entire games, over the Internet, and then they’re ready to play one second after the release time—no store lines, no drive back home, no stuffed servers or crashed discs. It seems like a remarkable bit of trust, though it’s really just a way to lessen server load on release day.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>It’s hard to pin down which game first offered pre-loading in the modern sense, but <i>HL2</i>, being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">a major launch title for Valve’s Steam service</a> and a title with heavy demand, definitely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news-270804"><span>popularized the concept</span></a>.</p>
<h2>Always-online for single-player games</h2>
<p>Here’s one way that <i>Half-Life 2</i> moved the industry forward that some folks might want to move back.</p>
<p>Technically, you can play <i>HL2</i> without an Internet connection, and maybe for long periods of time. But for most people, playing <i>HL2</i> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/half-life-2-single-player-no-internet.446819/">without a persistent net connection</a> involves activating the game on Steam, letting it fully update, and then turning on Steam’s “Offline Mode” to play it. There’s no time limit, but you need to keep Steam active while playing.</p>
<p>It’s not so much the particular connection demands of <i>HL2</i> that make it notable, but the pathway that it, and Steam, created on which other companies moved ahead, treating gaming as something that, by default, happens with at least a connection, and preferably a persistent one.</p>

<h2>A place on “All-time” video game rankings forever</h2>
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em> introduced many ground-breaking things at once—deep facial animations and expressions, an accessible physics engine, a compelling global-scale but family-minded story—while also being tremendously enjoyable game to play through. This has made it hard for anyone to suggest another game to go above it on any "All-time greatest games" list, especially those with a PC focus.</p>
<p><span>Not that they don’t try. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-top-100-pc-games-2024/#section-10-1"><span>PC Gamer has <i>HL2</i> at 7 out of 100</span></a>, mostly because it has lost an understandable amount of “Hotness” in 20 years. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time"><span>IGN has it at No. 9</span></a> (while its descendant <i>Portal 2</i> takes third place). Metacritic, however fallible, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/pc/"><span>slots it in universal second place</span></a> for PC games.</span></p>
<p>So give <i>Half-Life 2</i> even more credit for fostering innovation in the “arbitrary ranked list of games” genre. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">Rock Paper Shotgun’s top 100</a> is cited as the best “to play on PC today,” as they have “paid no mind to what was important or influential.” And yet, <i>Half-Life 2</i>, as a game you can play in 2024, is still on that list. It’s really something, that game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc">a rewarding series of point-and-click murder mysteries</a> that became one of my favorite games of 2022. And while I felt there was more story to explore about the titular golden idol, I wasn’t sure if a potential sequel could live up to its clever puzzles and fascinating, slowly unfolding story. Turns out, I had nothing to fear: <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267159/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-release-date-trailer">the newly launched sequel</a>, easily surpasses the original by improving on just about everything.</p><p>At its core, <em>Rise</em> is a very similar game to <em>Case</em>. The new game takes place in the 1970s, around 200 years after the events of the original, and each of <em>Rise</em>’s cases drops you into a specific moment in time, typically during or shortly after a murder. You’re tasked with solving what’s going on. To figure that out, you first have to click around the scene to discover relevant words and names that get saved in a menu. Then you use those words to solve puzzles within the case, like the names of the individuals in a scene, a description of how the murder happened, or even things like how to interpret parts of a dance or who won a game show.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s an example of how you use the words you find to solve elements of a case.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>It’s a clever system. Clicking around to collect all of the words forces you to scrutinize everything that’s going on, and having to fill in the blanks means you really have to think about how elements of the scene might be connected. I’ve come to think of it like an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278619/wilmot-works-it-out-review">elaborate jigsaw puzzle</a>: while the scattered elements may seem like a lot to tie together, as you slowly solve the disparate elements of the puzzles within cases, it’s easier to figure out how they connect.</p><p>There are more layers, too, as you have to solve puzzles encompassing the events of entire chapters, which typically have three or four cases within them, to be able to move on to the next one. A few recurring characters will pop up across chapters, meaning the game is able to tell a holistic story by forcing you to understand their actions across a bunch of different scenes. (You don’t need to have played <em>Case</em> to understand the events of <em>Rise</em>, though there are a few tidbits that will be familiar to fans of the first game.)</p><p>The system isn’t perfect. Like with <em>Case</em>, if you’re off the mark after you’ve slotted in words for a specific puzzle, <em>Rise</em> will tell you if your guess is incorrect or if you have two or fewer words in the wrong place. Usually, knowing that I was close meant I could reexamine my assumptions and tweak a few words to get things right. But as I also did with <em>Case</em>, if I couldn’t figure out the two or fewer incorrect words on my own, I would just brute-force a bunch of guesses until I got things right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rise</em> has some tough puzzles, but so far, I’ve been able to solve all of them without turning to an online guide like I had to do with the final few cases of <em>Case</em>. <em>Rise</em> also has an improved hint system that offers up to three hints for a specific part of a case, and often, checking those pointed me in the right direction when I was stuck. I’d also recommend having pen and paper handy to write things down, especially because some cases scatter details across multiple areas. And if you can play with someone else, that helps, too — my wife saw a bunch of things that I completely missed.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>I will warn you that the game can be grotesque. <em>Case</em> generally erred on the side of creepy with its old-school pixel art style, but <em>Rise</em> looks more like a painting, and that means you’ll be seeing slightly more realistic dead bodies. Scenes and characters move in short loops, which makes them feel alive but also means you’ll see certain uncomfortable movements over and over again. The first case opens with a man actively strangling somebody else; another shows a person getting electrocuted. If you have a fear of birds, there’s one case you’re really not going to like. But like a good scary movie, those twisted scenes are part of what makes the game compelling. Every time I started a new case, I was always eager to see what terrible things I’d come across.</p><p>I’m not quite done with <em>Rise.</em> After more than 15 hours, I’m on one of the last of the game’s 20 cases, and this one is taking me a couple of days to muddle through. I think the eventual thrill of figuring it all out will be worth the pain, though, as there’s nothing better than that lightbulb moment of slotting the final word into the right place of the puzzle. And even when I’m done with all 20 cases, there will be <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2716400%2Fview%2F4478360632965464065">four DLC packs</a> to look forward to next year — perhaps there’s even more that we don’t know about the mysterious golden idol.</p><p><small>The Rise of the Golden Idol<em> is now available for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and on mobile with a Netflix subscription.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
