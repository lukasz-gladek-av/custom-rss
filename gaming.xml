Wizards of the Coast's iconic fantasy TTRPG will be a part of the park's newest event. The aptly titled Universal Fan Fest will bring several beloved nerd properties to life in a new after-hours event.</p>
<h2>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Universal Fan Fest Announcement</h2>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/events-and-seasonal-activities/fan-fest-nights">official event page</a>, the Universal Fan Fest will celebrate several beloved sci-fi, fantasy, and anime properties through immersive live experiences, themed-food, and exclusive merchandise.</p>

They will help the Harpers save the city of Waterdeep from the machinations of the mercenary leader, Xanathar.</p>
<p>But the Forgotten Realms won't be the only experience at the event. Attendees can also embark on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-trek-panic-review-she-cannae-take-anymore" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek's</em></a> iconic Enterprise-D bridge, join Luffy's crew for a <em>One Piece</em> pirate adventure, and witness an epic sorcery battle from the world of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>.</p>
<p>The Universal Fan Fest is by the same creators as Halloween Horror Nights. This is another after-hours Universal Studios Hollywood event dedicated to Haunted House attractions based on horror properties like <em>Ghostbusters</em>, <a href="https://blog.discoveruniversal.com/events/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-strangerthings-4-house-at-halloween-horror-nights-2023-hhn/"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>, and <a href="https://halloweenhorrornights.fandom.com/wiki/Welcome_to_Silent_Hill_(Orlando)"><em>Silent Hill</em></a>.</p>
<p>Further details are scarce on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Universal Fan Fest. According to an official <a href="https://x.com/UniStudios/status/1844061649327526162">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the event will be live between April 25 and May 18 2025. There is currently no information on ticket prices or pre-order details.</p>

<p>On the more academic side, Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-dd-adopt-classroom-partnership" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has continued</a> to leverage the creative application of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> in a classrom context.</p>
<p>The studio has recently partnered with the group Young Minds Inspired to create <a href="https://ymiclassroom.com/lesson-plans/places/"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Places, Cities, and Worlds</em></a>. It's a set of resources designed for students grades 3-5 and 6-8.</p>
<p>The goal of the kit is to get students to explore the role of settings in storytelling through the collaborative power of TTRPGs. It is designed to encourage creative thinking and narrative writing skills.</p>

Get a glimpse of what it’s like when any noise can betray you with the game’s new “Survive in Silence” live-action trailer! </p></blockquote><p>So yeah, if you are playing the game with this feature turned on and your phone rings or you sneeze that might be enough noise to get the attention of a nasty alien monster, likely leading to your in-game character’s death. </p><p>I love when games use microphones like this and it feels like a perfect fit for this franchise. Past examples I can think of include<em> Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>—which forced co-op players to whisper in-game to avoid enemies hearing them—and <em>Manhunt</em>—which let you use the mic to distract deadly guards. <em>Alien Isolation</em> also included a mic detection feature, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754">Hopefully, it’s also in the just-announced sequel</a></span>. </p><p>I’m all for these weird features as they add a whole new layer to the gameplay. But I’m also happy most of them, like in the <em>Quiet Place</em> game, are optional. Otherwise, I’d be killed a lot because of my cat coming in and meowing for attention. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cngwpqYZbNl&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cngwpqYZbNl" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em></a></span> launches October 17 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of historical miniature wargaming, there are few conflicts that quite capture the imagination of gamers quite like World War II - and for those gamers, one of the most popular games on the market is <i>Bolt Action</i>. Warlord Games just released a new edition of the game, and they sent me a copy to review. Could this be a good entry point into historical wargaming? Read my <i>Bolt Action</i> 3rd Edition Review to find out!</p>

<p>First developed by Alessio Cavatore and Rick Priestley in 2012, <i>Bolt Action</i> is a 28mm miniature wargame taking place across the span of WWII. And while Warlord Games creates many different models for a wide array of armies, the game itself is technically manufacturer agnostic. As long as your miniatures are 28mm scale and set on round 25mm bases, there’s nothing saying you can’t use them.</p>
<p>In the game, players will collect, build, and paint armies from this era, clashing against one another on the tabletop. And while this review is also covering the rules in general, we’re mainly taking a look at <a href="https://us.warlordgames.com/products/bolt-action-battle-of-the-bulge-starter-set-with-hardback-rulebook">the new <i>Battle of the Bulge Starter Set</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<h2><b>What’s Included in the <i>Bolt Action Battle of the Bulge</i> 3rd Edition Starter Set?</b></h2>
<p>Included in the <i>Bolt Action</i> <i>Battle of the Bulge</i> 3rd Edition Starter<i> </i>Set are the Bolt Action A5 rulebook (this is the entire rulebook, condensed into a smaller sized softcover book), a starter scenario and assembly booklet, Bolt Action dice, and six-sided dice.</p>
<p>On the miniatures front, we get 24 hard plastic US Winter Army infantry models (on 4 sprees), 18 hard plastic German Winter Fallschirmjäger paratrooper models (on 3 sprues), 1 hard plastic M8 Greyhound armored car (can also make an M20 scout car) with a transfer sheet, 1 hard plastic Ruined Farmhouse terrain piece, plenty of pin markers, and templates for heavy explosive attacks.</p>
<p>For an extra $50 USD, you can upgrade the bundle to also include a hardcover version of the rulebook. And while I don’t know if I would have upgraded had they not sent me the hardcover, I’m glad to have it - as the text is much bigger and makes leafing through to run down a rule all the easier.</p>
<h2><b>How Do You Play <em>Bolt Action</em> 3rd Edition?</b></h2>
<p>In my opinion, the core of what sets <i>Bolt Action </i>apart and makes it special is the way the game handles activating units. For each of your units on the board, you’ll add a special six-sided die to a bag. Your opponent will do the same with their own (differently colored) dice. Then, someone will reach into the bag and remove one die - whoever’s color is pulled is first to activate a unit. Once that unit has activated, you repeat the process, pulling another die from the bag.</p>
<p>You get to choose which of your units you activate, and you get to choose how you activate them (more on that in a moment), but the thrill of not knowing when you’re going to get to activate adds some really nice tension to the game. This does a really nice job of breaking up the “I Go, You Go” nature of so many miniature wargames.</p>
<h2><b>Attacking in <em>Bolt Action</em> 3rd Edition</b></h2>
<p>When activating units, you’ll fire upon your enemies with various weapons, all of which have different ranges, amounts of dice they roll, armor penetration values (for larger weapons), and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To simplify things a bit, you’ll essentially be doing the following: rolling a collection of d6’s to see if you hit your target, then your opponent can potentially react by hitting the deck (and losing their action), and then you’ll roll for damage, and they’ll roll for cover saves! Each model has 1 health, so one point of damage takes them out. Remove enough units in one go, and you might just scare your enemy off the board if they fail a morale test.</p>
<h2><b>Activating With <em>Bolt Action</em> Dice</b></h2>
<p>The <i>Bolt Action</i> dice - those same custom dice you’ll pull from the dice bag to see who activates first - also tell you the six different actions you can assign to your units. Let’s break it down one by one, because it very cleanly lays out how to play the game!</p>
<ul><li><b>Fire </b>- Unit fires their weapons at full effect</li>
<li><b>Advance </b>- Unit moves their Advance speed (6” for infantry) and then fires<b> </b>(with a -1 penalty to non-Assault weapons)</li>
<li><b>Run - </b>Unit moves at twice their Advance speed</li>
<li><b>Ambush - </b>Unit holds their action and waits to attack</li>
<li><b>Rally - </b>Unit removes all pin markers (pin markers make it harder to shoot <i>and</i> harder to take any action at all)</li>
<li><b>Down - </b>Unit gains either 5+ cover save or (if already in cover) a +2 to their cover save rolls. Also, if they stay Down for two turns, remove all pin markers.</li>
</ul><h2><b>Units Included In the <i>Bolt Action Battle of the Bulge</i> 3rd Edition Starter Set</b></h2>
<p>Now I want to briefly chat about the units included in the <i>Bolt Action Battle of the Bulge</i> starter set. For the American forces, it instructs you to build one NCO unit of three (with quick-bursting SMGs), one 11-man unit, and a 10-man unit. You’ll also build the M8 Greyhound armored truck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all of the army construction I did with this box, this was the only aspect that gave me trouble. Maybe it’s a skill issue, (though god knows I’ve put together my fair share of confounding Sylvaneth Treelord Ancients) but I seriously struggled to follow along, and ended up with (gasp!) extra parts left by the wayside.</p>
<p>For the German combatants, you’ll build one 3-man NCO team, and then three 5-man Veteran units (Veteran units are harder to hit, and have higher morale). Two of those three units also include a one-shot anti-vehicle weapon, giving them a shot against that Greyhound.</p>
<p>All in all, both sides of the field feel very well-balanced, especially when weapon upgrades are factored in. And the starter scenarios in the assembly booklet help ease you into the game (before, tantalizingly, presenting a final scenario where you need units not included in the starter set).</p>
<h2><b><i>Bolt Action </i>3rd Edition Review - Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p>Though I didn’t have any experience playing any historical wargaming prior to this, I’ve had my eye on <i>Bolt Action</i> for a long time. For years, words like “accessible” and “fast-paced” have been thrown around when people talk about this game, setting it apart from the (perhaps incorrect) preconception of historical wargames as being a bit stuck in the mud.</p>
<p>When the opportunity to check out <i>Bolt Action </i>3rd Edition came around, I jumped at the opportunity. And what I found in this box is a game that is absolutely engrossing, with an approachable ruleset that doesn’t skimp at all on depth and detail. The rulebook is full of gorgeously painted dioramas and battle scenes, and there’s so much to dig into once you begin building beyond what’s included in the core box.</p>
<p>If I had any critiques of the Starter Set box as a whole, it would be the lack of diversity among models included. While I understand that keeping the models included in the box limited to infantry and one vehicle lessens the amount of rules needed to jump into the game, it would have been nice to see something like a mortar team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, because you’re starting with mostly infantry, playing the game was fun and, yes, fast-paced. The action economy in this game is second-to-none, and rolling a clutch of dice as your soldiers unleash punishing rifle fire is extremely satisfying, every time.</p>
<p>But more important than all of that is that fact that <i>Bolt Action</i> 3rd Edition completely ignited my imagination, and made me want to go out and learn everything I could about these specific WWII battles, and immerse myself in more of the in-depth, tactical history of the war.</p>
<p>That’s the true power of a historical wargame. Sure, <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</i> can inspire you to read fantasy literature. And <i>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</i> can inspire you to check out back-issues of your favorite super-heroes. But with a game like <i>Bolt Action</i>, I find myself looking for books to read and movies to watch about The Battle of the Bulge. It’s an experience that can be, for the right gamer, as enriching as it is entertaining - and when that happens, it’s truly something special.</p>

On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the “Alarmo” alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p><p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo characters from franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, and you can set the alarm to wake you up with music from those franchises.

It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock</a>, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.)</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2bbb28fa-96a7-4ac0-b64e-ca97a63a59f5"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-aa59004d-083d-4ad8-b1d3-a3f5b44cae10"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266135/nintendo-original-alarm-clock-alarmo-prototypes">Nintendo’s original alarm clock prototypes were a lot less playful</a></h2><p>Nintendo just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">its new Alarmo clock</a> with a motion sensor, and even though we’re still soaking in the $100 device, the company also shared a look at some interesting early prototypes that reveal how the project changed during its development.</p><p>While the Alarmo is round and an eye-catching red, one “early” prototype Nintendo showed in an “Ask the Developer” interview had a more boxy shape and came in gray. This prototype did have an interesting feature in its dot matrix LED display (similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205675/amazon-discontinue-echo-dot-with-clock">now-discontinued Echo Dot with Clock</a>), but Nintendo ultimately went in a different direction because “we felt that this display system wouldn’t be able to communicate the instructions sufficiently,” says Nintendo’s Yosuke Tamori, who oversaw the development of the Alarmo. “It was especially difficult to explain the product’s new features, such as the motion sensor,” he says.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266135/nintendo-original-alarm-clock-alarmo-prototypes">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5955c8c3-5e1f-4d38-929b-9e22f3b87d2e"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-df5a3dbc-ec5d-4169-adc8-3d1f8503992e"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">What’s this new mystery Nintendo device?</a></h2><p>Nintendo has submitted a <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001">mysterious new wireless device</a> to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this weekend, and it isn’t the Switch 2 console we’re expecting to be revealed before next April.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/humble-games-parent-company-looks-for-assistance-in-laid-off-staffs-new-label/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although Humble Games helped to publish some fantastic games such as TemTem, SIGNALIS, and Mineko's Night Market, July 2024 saw a huge change within the company that caused uproar across social media. It's no surprise that there was uproar, as Humble Games announced out of the blue that they had laid off their 36 staff in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/humble-games-says-it-is-not-closing-down-just-restructuring/">decision to "restructure" the company</a>. There was a lot of denial that they had laid off all of their staff, but those who worked within the company began to come forward and say their entire team was gone. Today,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-humble-games-staff-found-new-indie-publisher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Eurogamer announced</a> that the staff who were laid off in July are now partnering up with Ziff Davis, the parent company of Humble Games. Considering that the choice to lay off the staff most likely came from them, this is a bit of a baffling choice to make.</p>
<p>As a result of this partnership, it means those who were laid off from Humble Games now get to continue working with them while working under their new label, the Good Games Group. Considering the harsh choice made to lay off the staff who were working there and helping publish the game, it seems like a bit of a strange decision now to enlist the help of those in the company.</p>
<p>While the games they will be working on and developing will be published under the Humble Games name, it's said that the workers at Good Games Group made this decision to help build up their network of indie developers. With how rough it is in the games industry right now, a decision like that makes perfect sense; it allows familiar faces to work with indie developers who may be treading uncertain ground and also allows the developers to put in a good word for the employees working at the company, which could lead to other projects being taken on in the future.</p>
<p>Although the decision to work with a company that rid them of financial security seems like a bizarre move, it seems like they are now using the collaboration to sway it in their favor, as the header on <a href="https://www.goodgamesgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a> shows off some of the previous games they worked on over at Humble Games, such as Supraland, SIGNALIS, and Ring of Pain. At the moment, it's unknown what games Good Games Group will be responsible for, as none of their projects are currently listed on the website.</p>
<p>Humble Games hasn't yet made a statement about the new collaboration, but it's uncertain if they will or what role either company will be playing in this collaboration.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-closer-look-at-nintendo%E2%80%99s-adorable-alarmo-clock.1005447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Look, I’m a sucker for instant gratification. It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock</a>, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.)</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The top dial is very fun to bop.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Turns out, you don’t need to worry about that. I haven’t tried all of Alarmo’s various sounds, but<strong> </strong>even the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> theme that plays during the setup process eliminated my worries that it would sound like crap. That setup routine is actually quite lengthy and might prove to be a bit much for a child. You choose the date and time, of course, but you’re also led through configuring the clock’s motion-detection features, which takes a bit of time, and I didn’t see any way of skipping it. Alarmo’s millimeter-wave presence sensor works with bed sizes ranging from twin to king, and the screen is meant to face the middle of your bed.</p><div><figcaption><em>The top dial can display a range of colors.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The display is not a touchscreen, nor is it round. (And I feel like Nintendo’s promotional video exaggerates its size a little.) It does automatically adjust brightness based on ambient lighting. One fun little detail is that the clock screen and typeface will change depending on the alarm you’ve chosen. Whenever the regular clock is showing, the character onscreen will also move from left to right based on your own movements if you’re within range of the motion sensors. </p><p>You control Alarmo with the buttons up top. The large dial can be turned to navigate menus and pressed to make selections. There’s a back button to the left and a notifications button to the right. I’ve barely used the clock, but presumably, this is where you might get notified about your sleep metrics. (There’s no serious health monitoring or anything like that; don’t expect Mario to warn you about snoring or potential sleep apnea.)</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hope you weren’t expecting a round display.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The top dial lights up in a range of colors; you’ll see quite a few within the first few minutes of using Alarmo. Aside from the core alarm functionality, Alarmo also has sleep sounds that you can doze off to. Nintendo plans to offer new sounds that can be downloaded to the clock with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.<strong> </strong>(When you access this menu, a prompt advises younger users to seek out a parent or guardian.)</p><p>Is this thing absurdly expensive for what it is? Certainly. But for its demographic, it’s very cute, and there are small, thoughtful Nintendo touches throughout the experience — and I’ve barely dug in.</p><p>Here are some more photos of the $99 Nintendo clock.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Alarmo includes alarms, sleep sounds, and hourly chimes.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Do not make Alarmo ask you twice.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Moving your body quiets the alarm, and getting out of bed stops it completely.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>You’d better not sneak back into bed.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Alarm is powered by a USB-C port. (It comes with a black cable, not the one seen here.)</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Stay tuned for our full review soon.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The refurbished console’s landing page states that the systems are “extensively cleaned, tested, and ready for a brand-new home.” Two versions of the PS5 are available refurbished: the base model with a disc drive and the digital one that comes without one.</p><p>That means that if you’re looking to potentially get a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-slim-release-date-size-comparison-1850926269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-slim-release-date-size-comparison-1850926269">slim model of the PS5</a></span>, your best bet is just picking up a brand new one at full retail price, though these consoles are <em>also</em> discounted for a short while right now. Otherwise, the only used systems being sold directly by PlayStation are the base versions that first launched in 2020.</p><p>The refurbished model with a disc drive is going for $400, undercutting the cost of a brand new PS5 by about $100. The real draw of the deal is the digital version though, which starts at $350, making it the technically cheapest model of the PS5 available on the market right now. Both come packing certified PlayStation replacement parts and a one-year warranty in case things go sideways.

As part of its counter Prime Day sale, Walmart is offering a <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRjOY?object_uuid=3aab1672-cdea-449d-be05-23b2d3acd2ba&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">512B SanDisk Ultra</a> Micro SDXC card for only $19.99. Walmart+ members get automatic free shipping, otherwise you'll need to get your order total over $35 to get free shipping (just buy two). SanDisk, which is owned by WD, is the most popular brand of flash memory devices. In fact, all of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/microsdxc-card-for-nintendo-switch-128gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Nintendo Switch memory cards</a> are actually rebadged SanDisk Micro SD cards.</p><h2>512GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card for $19.99</h2><div id="168464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch Compatible</p></div><p><h3>SanDisk Ultra 512GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, some of it reserved for the OS. To give you an idea of how paltry those capacities are, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. If there's any one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories">Switch accessory</a> that we think is absolutely required, it's a high-capacity memory card.</p><p>The Steam Deck is equally space constrained. Although it starts out with more base storage (64GB to 512GB), Steam games can easily take up far more space than that base storage. For example, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-steam-deck-games">best games to play on Steam Deck</a> take up over 60GB each. Even if you opted for the 512GB model, you're going to run out of space sooner than you think. For more information, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-review">Steam Deck review</a> or, for that matter, our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally review</a>. </p><p>The SanDisk Ultra Micro SD card offers an extra 512GB of storage on top of your base capacity. It's compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard including the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and the ROG Ally. This is a U1 A1 V10 rated card with up to 120MBps read speeds. There are faster cards out there, but the Nintendo Switch can't take advantage of such speeds. An SD card adapter is also included in the packaging.</p><p>This is easily one of the best  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-steam-deck-deals">Steam Deck deals</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">Nintendo Switch deals</a> available for October Prime Day, and absolutely worth considering if you find yourself short on space all too often.

Then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGHMK89?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this bundle</a> available during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a> might be your favorite discount of the season. It pulls together an Xbox Controller, Fire TV Stick 4K, and a one-month membership to Game Pass Ultimate for <strong>just $75 (was $137)</strong>. Considering the controller alone retails for $70, this is a pretty awesome price cut.</p><p>Since the Fire TV Stick 4K supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate via cloud streaming, it’s one of the most affordable ways to check out the service. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to download games like you can on PC or Xbox, meaning your catalog will be limited to titles that support cloud streaming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4382102-51nhiuvefvl._sl1001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382102" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4382102-51nhiuvefvl._sl1001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382102"></a><figcaption>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4382102-51nhiuvefvl._sl1001.jpg"></figure><p>Thankfully, many of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">best games</a> are compatible with the technology--including Halo Infinite, Fallout 4, Doom Eternal, and Forza Horizon 5.</p><p>This bundle is available in two formats.

The new controller was released a few months ago and is regularly listed at $70, while the other variants often see $15 discounts.</p><p>If you do pick up this awesome bundle, you should strongly consider pairing it with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-3-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-50-off-today-only-october-9/1100-6526404/" data-ref-id="1100-6526404">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, as it’s on sale for <strong>just $29</strong>.

<p>343 Industries — now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-moves-to-unreal-engine-5-with-multiple-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Studios</a> — was working on the sequel to Halo Infinite. According to a new claim, Halo Infinite 2 was in development before it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh07V_QF5Oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a>, who has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-7-gets-new-lead-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">been at the forefront</a> of Halo coverage, says that Halo Infinite 2 was in development on the Slipspace Engine that was developed for the first Infinite game. That development, he said, continued until a leadership change in late 2022 where the decision was made to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move the franchise</a> to Unreal Engine 5. That led to the cancellation of Halo Infinite 2 on Slipspace.</p>







<p>“343’s creative team spent a few months learning Unreal Engine 5 to prepare for the next project,” Rebs said. “This lasted until January 2023 when Microsoft laid off a significant amount of 343 employees, including the entire creative team.”</p>



<p>It was added that it’s unclear if the next mainline Halo game is Halo Infinite 2 but in Unreal Engine 5 or if it’s a different game altogether.</p>



<p>The report also mentioned that the campaign team that was let go “never felt supported” by the new leadership at the studio.</p>



<p>“The campaign team felt trapped in a bubble without studio-wide collaboration and clarity about what was happening at the studio,  and its plans for the future,” he said.</p>



<p>It was added that campaign content was possibly being outsourced with no replacement team being created.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Halo Studios for comment on this report. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-washington-state-is-doing-to-juice-local-game-development<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers are probably familiar with "country pavilions" at events like Gamescom and Game Developers Conference. They're areas organized by region-affiliated trade groups or governments that shine a light on game development in their regions—both to help games from those areas find an audience, and to convince investors and studios to open up shop in their area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2024's country pavilion was a nearly overwhelming sight this year, with China, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Indonesia, Estonia, The Philippines, and other countries represented with booths large and small, each filled with developers demoing their games, pitching to investors, or soliciting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One country was not represented: The United States. Or...was it? One solitary booth from the land of the red, white, and blue stood tall, though ironically, it was painted a more emerald green.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's because the pavilion belonged to the Washington State Department of Commerce, and it was staffed by creative economy development director Shannon Roche Halberstadt. A veteran of the Recording Industry Association of America, Halberstadt explained to Game Developer that she took the role with the Washington State government to help support game development in the state, already home to Valve, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, and a slew of triple-A game studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With companies like those already ruling the roost, why exactly would the state government trek all the way out to Germany to showcase the state? Halberstadt told Game Developer it's part of a project not just to attract new companies to the region but to support local studios...and keep them from decamping for new pastures.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Keeping developers in Washington despite the high cost of living">Keeping developers in Washington despite the high cost of living</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our conversation with Halberstadt comes at a time when&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">atrociously high development costs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in the United States are sending publishers and investors scurrying to parts of the world where lower costs of living drive cheaper salaries and, thus, cheaper budgets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, when you think "high salaries" in the United States, Washington State definitely lands on the list. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/cost-of-living-by-state/">A 2024 analysis by Forbes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> put it as the state with the eighth-highest cost of living in the nation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Salaries in the Seattle and Redmond areas are dragged upward by the presence of Microsoft and Amazon, but developers there also have to contend with brutal housing costs that only go down when you head south to Olympia or Tacoma or across the water to Bremerton or Poulsbo.

"It's a really great place," she said. "You're around all these other companies. You're gonna have peers, you're gonna have people who are already in the industry. You'll be able to access support services. You'll be able to access networking and meetups...that community actually is a really important thing."</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Department of Commerce can't tackle high housing costs on its own (Halberstadt deferred to the legislature on that topic), but she said there are other levers it's pulling to boost development in the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Funding from the state itself for startups and indies isn't likely to come any time soon, but she said part of her journey to Gamescom was to research how other countries support developers. She also wants the State to look into incentives like those for the aerospace or agriculture industries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her primary concern however has to do with getting smaller studios in front of investors and publishers. It's another reason she came to Gamescom—she gestured to a table behind her, where game studio One More Game was showing off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790700/SWAPMEAT/">SWAPMEAT</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The game had picked up the "Creative Overload" award at the Devcom Indie Showcase just the night before, something that couldn't have happened unless the Department of Commerce had brought them to the event.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of that award, they said, they were getting meetings with interested parties they wouldn't get at home.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Halberstadt is new to the games business, she seemed up to speed on how traditional business development loans don't work well for game studios. "Game studios have a really difficult time accessing traditional financial products because the arc to product creation is so long," she said. "The financials don't work out for a bank down the street that's doing an SBA loan. It makes it really difficult." Her hope is that Washington's government can work with financial entities to incentivize loans that support game studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the state's game development economy is already self-sustaining, why does Halberstadt need to get involved at all? "You invest in water where the grass is green to keep it green," she said. "If you're not investing and you're not creating a space to develop new talent...the industry can go other places."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She gestured to the trade floor, where dozens of countries were eagerly pitching themselves as places for studios to land.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Video games can help artists earn a living">Video games can help artists earn a living</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned before, Halberstadt came out of the music industry, previously working at the RIAA. She said she became interested in video games after meeting so many musicians and recording professionals talking about how much income they were pulling from the business. "People were finding living wage jobs where they didn't have to piece together a lot of work," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her investment in video games as a place for artists to earn a living wage rang through our conversation. Though her employer is concerned with tax revenue and GDP, she had far higher-minded inspirations. "There's so much great art that comes through video games," she gushed. "It's a way that people connect...it's such a great way of creating cohesion."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She joked that she'd </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>prefer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if other states didn't invest as hard in their game industries so that everyone would come to Washington, but she acknowledged there's room across the country for different territories to lean on their different strengths and ultimately come together for a healthier business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What would she say to industry professionals pushing similar initiatives in other states?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just two words: "keep going."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa Tech.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
