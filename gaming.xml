			<p>At Gamescom 2024, Blizzard showcased Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, the first of a series of expansions coming to the action RPG with a scheduled annual cadence.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-is-the-first-expansion-due-in-late-2024-will-add-brand-new-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during the BlizzCon 2023 Opening Ceremony, Vessel of Hatred is set to add the Spiritborn class, which is brand new to the Diablo franchise. You can check it out in action in our gameplay capture video available below.</p>
<p>During the German convention, I had the chance to interview Game Director Brent Gibson and Systems Designer Aislyn Hall to discuss not only Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred but also the future of the live service game at length. Here's the full transcript of our chat. As a reminder, the expansion is out on October 8 on all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Gamescom 4K Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItkbOwx5XQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>To start off, which feature from Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred do you think is most important for the future of the game since you plan to support it for years to come?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> The most important new feature, well, we're adding new ways to play, we're adding new forms of power. I think Mercenaries is going to have a really big impact on gameplay. Not only is it going to give players who like to play solo a small taste of playing in a party, where they can take the weaknesses of their class build and supplement it with a follower that comes along, but they can also use this whole new feature that we have called reinforcements.</p>
<p>With this one, you can take a mercenary and slot them into come into the fight for a moment, pull off the power of me. The cool thing about that is that you can actually define the condition, like, my health is getting low, come in and tank some of my damage, for example. It essentially starts to address the feedback that people want more skills and abilities on their bar. Now you can actually use reinforcement as kind of an additional ability that you normally wouldn't have.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall:</strong> Another feature in Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred that I think is really important and is going to have an impact further on is the Kurast Undercity. It's really important in a game like Diablo that there are a lot of different activities that you can participate in, a lot of different activities that are relevant to the endgame. The Kurast Undercity is going to be a time attack mode where you have to go quickly through a dungeon. It also has a tribute system that allows you to search for specific kinds of gear that your character specifically needs right now. So, with those two things combined, I think having just a different way to play, combined with the specific rewards that it gives you, is going to be a really, really important thing.</p>
<p><strong>With the addition of Mercenaries, did you have to balance the whole game a bit differently because people can now have these companions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> Yeah, every time we add a new source of power, we have to balance it against everything else. Not only are we adding a new class that has to be balanced against everything, but then we also have the Mercenaries system that has to be balanced in such as well. We're making a bunch of changes in the game from the progression system that allows us to have a more sustainable way of looking at the balance across the game, and the difficulty across the game, and being able to add new ways to earn new sources of power without breaking everything.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, there are going to be some major progression updates similar in scope to Season 4 Loot Reborn with how itemization was fundamentally altered there. Russian season 640B is to be really improved upon as well, and so we're basically using that philosophically as an opportunity to lay the foundations of Diablo IV for years to come to ensure that when we're adding features like Mercenaries or other sources of power to the game, that the game is going to remain in a healthy state where players can always face a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Do the Mercenaries only work in the open world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> They work in dungeons as well. They're always with you in some form and you have a lot of control over how they come along with you.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, if you have a full party of players, you can't use them, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> That's where the Reinforcement system comes in. If you have a full party, you can still use your Reinforcement. I can set up Raheir, who gives me advantages to taking damage, and then I can also have Varyana, who gives me advantages to attack speed, and I can have that combination. You might be using a fire build, in which case you'll want to bring Aldkin around because he can do a lot of fire damage if you spec them that way, and so he can actually amplify your fire build. There's a lot of different ways to mix and match.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>The Reinforcements are like a separate concept from the Mercenaries themselves in the sense that you can have your Reinforcement regardless of how many people are in your party, like Brent said. Even if you're in a full party of players, you'll still have your reinforcement, and the reinforcement will use an ability based on what you decide when you want them to use it. There are a lot of different triggers that you can set, so it can be whenever you reach low health, then perhaps you can set them to use a defensive ability. Or you could set it so that when you use a big AoE attack, they can use an ability that might pull everyone in, so there are a lot of synergies.</p>

<p><strong>I know that Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred is also adding a multiplayer dungeon. Did that desire come internally, or was it more community feedback that you got?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> The excitement around doing more cooperative gameplay definitely came internally, but we also saw that our player base that likes to play socially has been growing, right? So we want to make sure that when we're adding new content to the game it is going to really reflect the type of people who are playing our game. We introduced a new cooperative PvE dungeon that has cooperative mechanics built into it, but the core gameplay is still that Diablo combat and it's just one way to challenge players who'd like to play together in the endgame. It was a little bit of both. We knew that we wanted to grow that player base, and it was actually happening, and so it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>A big part of the philosophy behind a lot of systems in Vessel of Hatred is that we want to ensure that what we're creating is really, really fun to do, either by yourself or in a group and doing it cooperatively. That ties into the progression changes that are coming, it ties into the Kurast Citadel, and it really is amplified across the entire game. We want to ensure that Vessel of Hatred is the best time to play Diablo IV.</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I'm a fan of MMOs. I've played World of Warcraft for a long time, so multiplayer dungeons are definitely something I'd like to see more. Actually, in a pre-release interview we did remotely, I asked if you would consider more defined player roles, like tank or support. Is that something you're talking about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>We definitely talk a lot about it. World of Warcraft has the Holy Trinity, you know, tank, DPS, and healer. Diablo IV is not quite that type of game. When we look at the when it comes to the rules and a cooperative thing. It's more about the activity, and so when we talk about cooperative mechanics, anybody can play any role, and the activity is just calling for a different type of interaction from those worlds. You've probably seen this in other games, but the focus is on the activity, not necessarily the class.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>It is something that I know the team is fully aware of in the sense that we know from previous Diablo had some builds for support focused characters, and more team oriented skills creating opportunities for that is definitely something the team is aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, you're adding the Spiritborn class. Whenever you add a new class to a game, for example, going back to World of Warcraft, when the Death Knight landed, it was by far the most popular class, and the other players that stick with the old classes feel a bit diminished for a while. So, what are you doing to make the other players using existing classes feel as powerful and cool as the Spiritborn?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>There's a couple of things. First off, every single class is going to get some update. They're going to get new skills, they're going to get changes to the progression. We will be releasing new items for the classes, so there's a lot to go on for those players who main a Barbarian, for example. They'll have changes where they can really dig in and do some really cool stuff. There's some more conversations that we'll have in our live stream about some of the upcoming progression changes that will help with that, but it's such a fundamental change that I think every player is going to have more than enough content to deal with. As for the Spiritborn, it's brand new and there's nothing we can do about that.</p>
<p>Actually, we're very excited about that, but one of the things you're going to see with the Spiritborn itself is that there are a lot of elements. Each Spirit Guardian that you can spec into has a different fighting style built in. If you're a Barbarian main, the Jaguar has some things that help you lean in that direction and customize it even beyond that. The hybridization is the thing that I think is really exciting. I think everybody who has a favorite class today will have something to experiment with in that regard, so I'd highly recommend giving it a try.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the story content included with Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, can you share how many hours of new gameplay players can expect on average?</strong></p>
<p>That is tough because it depends on the type of player. Some people skip all the cutscenes. There's the player who likes to kill every monster. There's the player who skips all the encounters to go straight to the bosses. There's so many different play styles. But this is a rich story, and if you sit down and you really enjoy it... It is a healthy next chapter to the game. Unfortunately, I can't put a number on it because I don't know what type of player will be reading in this article.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>The story of Vessel of Hatred is a direct continuation of the story from the original game, and I think you can expect the same degree of care and detail that went into the original campaign story.</p>
<p><strong>So, it's a bit like a new Act.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Yeah. It shares a lot of the same philosophies as what you saw in the base game. There's a certain amount of story that we want to be able to tell because we're learning about what the fate of the Soulstone is, so there's a lot of work that has to go into that. We're super proud of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Are there more itemization layers coming with the expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Nothing to announce today, but you're definitely going to want to stay tuned to our next couple of live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, we're going to have a campfire chat on August 29th, and we'll go over many details about the systemic changes coming.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The Armory isn't available at launch, but it's top of the list. However, there are no plans for an Auction House.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. Is there any news on Armory or Loadouts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>The Armory is at the top of the list of things we're considering, and we are trying to figure out the best way to bring a feature like that to the table. It's not at the launch of Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, but it is at the top of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Bigger stash?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Everybody loves to talk about the stash! Actually, I don't believe we have anything to announce today on the stash. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>You're adding a Party Finder with the update, correct?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Yes. Party Finder is a huge addition that we really feel is important to have for something like the Dark Citadel, because it's cooperative. I play with my friends, but sometimes they can't be online, so we need to have that. But it is something that applies to all activities in the game, and it is going to be available to everybody, regardless of Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other social features coming with the expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I think the biggest new social feature is our Party Finder.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Party Finder is a huge addition that we really feel is important to have for something like the Dark Citadel, because it's cooperative. But it is something that applies to all activities in the game, and it is going to be available to everybody, regardless of Vessel of Hatred.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>A lot of players ask about adding an Auction House.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>The great debate. There's no plan for an Auction House at this time.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen to our level 100 characters in the Eternal Realm, in case the cap is 60?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I would stay tuned for the progression discussion on August 29, but we're taking into account everybody coming in at every single level coming into Vessel of Hatred. The user experience is definitely going to be custom-tailored to make sure that everybody feels great.</p>
<p><strong>On a personal note, I wanted to add that I'm not a big fan of creating new characters every season. Especially early on, right after the game was released, it kind of felt like the Eternal Realm was a bit left behind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I've heard that feedback a lot. One of the things that you notice more often is our seasonal content is going to Eternal. We want to make sure that the Eternal players and the seasonal players are getting the same amount of fun. Now, we have a huge seasonal community that absolutely loves renewing, and we have a huge Eternal community, so we're going to continue to look at how we bring those two communities together.</p>
<p>You'll see that in seasons, obviously, and then there's other things like the progression changes that we're talking about. Everybody's going to get that. So if you are an Eternal player, you're going to get an extension of the campaign, you're going to get a new area to explore and unlock content, there's new dungeons, there's new gameplay modes, all that stuff is coming for the Eternal characters.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Out of all the updates that have come to Diablo IV so far, Vessel of Hatred is going to be the one with the most amount of new things that are coming to the Eternal Realm. As Brent said, we're going to continue to do our best to include as much as possible in seasons to the Eternal Realm.</p>
<p><strong>Are you looking into tweaking the difficulty curve early on? Some players say it's a bit too easy while you're leveling up until endgame.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>When we talk about fundamental changes to the progression system, we want the difficulty to feel smoother, and we'll want more player agency there, so it's definitely something we've been investing into.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, we have a philosophy that we have been utilizing with these major progression things that are coming, where we want to ensure that it's in the player's hands what kind of challenge they want to face and ensuring that you could tune the game's experience in any content, from the early game all the way to the very late game. That's a big guiding North Star for us with these changes coming in season 6.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>And a good example, you've talked about this in the past, is all the feedback we've been getting from the Profane Mindcage. We know that players are trying to use something like the Profane Mindcage to influence the difficulty, and we don't want a consumable to play that role, so we are looking to make some changes.</p>
<p><strong>What's your number one favorite feature in Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall:</strong> I really like the Dark Citadel. I ran through it a few weeks ago and it was just so exciting to go through and basically figure out the mechanics and have that feeling of overcoming a significant challenge with my friends. I really love that and we also get some pretty juicy rewards from it that we can cash every week. So, doing it every week once Vessel of Hatred launches is definitely going to be something fun.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> I'm gonna talk about the Spiritborn class. The playstyle, the rhythm, and the flow of this class really speak to my playstyle, so I'd have to say I'm really excited about the class.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is extremely healthy right now. I actually think our interaction with the media, the content creators, with our fans, we've been pouring a ton of energy into reaching out and getting the feedback and listening. The state of Diablo is the healthiest I think it's been since launch.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Earlier, you said there is a big Eternal community and a big seasonal community. Talking about the size of the Diablo IV community, is it healthy, especially after the Game Pass <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you know. Being on Game Pass is one of those things that we looked forward to the most, with the idea that we get out to as many players as possible. Diablo is a community that has a lot of folks that have been around since the first one, but something like Game Pass is also introducing the franchise to a bunch of newcomers. So, it is extremely healthy right now. I actually think our interaction with the media, the content creators, with our fans, we've been pouring a ton of energy into reaching out and getting the feedback and listening. The state of Diablo is the healthiest I think it's been since launch, and I'm super proud of it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

The first of two SNK characters coming during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-m-bison-terry-elena-mai-season-2-1851527248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-m-bison-terry-elena-mai-season-2-1851527248"><em>SF6</em>’s second season</a></span> (the other being Mai Shiranui), Terry appears to be landing with some force. <em>SF6 </em>adapts essentially the entirety of his iconic moveset, including his earth-shattering Power Wave punch, his gravity-defying Rising Tackle—where he spins like a top while he shoots up through the air feet first— and his searing Burning Knuckle. While I’ve only got a passing familiarity with Terry and the <em>Fatal Fury </em>series, I know him well enough to know that <em>SF6 </em>has done a wonderful job bringing these moves forward.</p><p>The reverence doesn’t stop there. Terry sports some of his signature looks, including the red jacket he’s most known for wearing, as well as a brown jacket from <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>. Depending on the fit he’s got on, he’ll even do different intro and winning animations, including a callback to Terry’s cap-throwing victory pose from the SNK games. In a game already bursting at the seams with love for its own legendary roster, it’s pretty great that <em>SF6 </em>rolls out the red carpet for Terry.</p><p>With the obvious caveat that <strong>I</strong> <strong>don’t really play fighting games all that regularly</strong>, Terry felt great in <em>SF6 </em>during my recent hands-on with the character<em>. </em>His Power Wave allows him to make some space for himself, while moves like Burning Knuckle and his Crack Shoot kick, where Terry flips forward and brings his leg down on his enemy, allow him to bridge sizable gaps and deal a ton of damage. Some characters are grapplers, others are great at mixups and such, and Terry strikes me as a great all-around character. He may not have a box you can fit him neatly into, but in the right hands, I’m sure he’ll be a menace and his inclusion in this game is exciting as hell.</p><p>On another note, I kind of suck at fighting games, and love ones that provide more tools for me to get better. I want to learn to be able to better appreciate the nuances between Terry and the rest of the <em>SF6 </em>roster. Training modes are a given for this, but <em>SF6 </em>is going the extra mile with two really neat new features that should help players (like me!) get better and feel more comfortable competing in Ranked lobbies. The first is a feature the team is calling Replay Review. More than just some glorified replay function, this new tool allows you to playback a match and then <em>take control </em>of one of the combatants in the recording. If you thought you got completely owned by a player who was using Manon in a way you’ve never seen before, you can review the match, study their movements, and then jump back into control of yourself to try your own strategies against them.</p><p>It’s a wild new tool that I’ve never heard of before—though it does seem to have been featured in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></span>—and it was utterly seamless in action. After whooping my opponent (sorry, bud) he took the opportunity to use the new function to see what I’d done to win. Upon taking control of his own character again, he implemented techniques he’d learned over the course of the fight to see if he could’ve squeezed me for more damage or cornered me in a different way. My own fighter was echoing the moves that I’d made in the fight, which even gave me time to critique my own playstyle. I’ve since learned that I jump in too much, and that’s probably what leaves me so vulnerable to punishes and anti-air techniques. We all took something valuable away from this cool new feature.</p><p>I expect a lot of pro players are going to be using this on the circuit to more closely review both their wins and losses, and to formalize their strategies. It’s great that it has use cases for players on either end of the spectrum though, since casual players can use the same tool to <em>begin </em>forming strategies and catalyzing winning playstyles. This great new feature will be rolling out with Terry’s addition on September 24.</p><p>Another feature that was mentioned was the introduction of a mode called V-Rivals. In it, players can pick a rank for an AI opponent based on the hierarchy found in <em>SF6</em>’s online Ranked competitions. The opponent will aggregate the playstyles of people found in that rank and then face off against the player in a form of training. Players are intended to play more or less around their rank or just above it in order to learn to climb the ladder, and the feature is primarily built for newcomers who are hesitant to jump into Ranked play. This way, players can grow more comfortable competing without sacrificing their status in online matches.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get to play this new mode as our preview site lacked the ability to connect to the network, but in theory, V-Rivals (which will launch alongside everything else in September) sounds like a great tool for someone like me. Playing in <em>SF6’s </em>preview window was humbling and I got my ass handed to me by <em>countless </em>friends of mine. Though it’s just the nature of competition, fighting games, with their 1v1 matchups, are among the most intimate online settings, making loss a deeply embarrassing experience. Being able to get comfortable with people around my level without actually having to step foot online might just be the thing I need to make <em>SF6 </em>into my go-to fighting game.</p><p>All in all, <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>seems like it’s in fantastic shape. People seem excited about the growing roster, and these new quality-of-life features seem like they’ll reaffirm what a great game it is all over again. In short, <em>SF6</em> has clearly still got plenty of steam and shows no signs of slowing down or stopping anytime soon. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Street Fighter 6:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-6-PS4-PlayStation-4/dp/B0BPJRGNSD/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0BPJRGNSD" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/clORrcqb6I4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/clORrcqb6I4" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fstreet-fighter-6%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fstreet-fighter-6%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The PUBG Nations Cup 2024 (PNC) is underway, with the tournament series beginning in just under two weeks. Here is everything we know about the tournament, including its prize pool, schedule and where to watch.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-nations-cup-2024-schedule">PUBG Nations Cup 2024 Schedule</h2>



<p>With some of the best PUBG: Battlegrounds teams in the world competing in the PUBG Nations Cup this year, fans are expecting some intense action.

<p>The dwarves of J.R.R. Tolkien's writing are, according to the author himself, "a tough, thrawn race for the most part, secretive, retentive of the memory of injuries (and of benefits)," and "lovers… of things that take shape under the hands of the craftsmen rather than things that live by their own life."</p>
<p>Is it secrecy and avarice that explains why <em>The Lord of the Rings: </em><em>Return to Moria</em> spent its first year of existence as an exclusive to the Epic Games Store? None can say for certain. But the survival crafting game has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/">arrived on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/9n96t1s3l9sb">Xbox</a>, adding to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDBaYWE2Nm9NNkRWM2lVVUQ4NXJ5ZW5WS3ZRQXxBQ3Jtc0tscEd2RVI1UnRkdTFEN2dLT3gxUUExQklCUEhuYVJWSHpST0xTeEpWeGtTbGR3TE1VMXpUZmtUVlczYnkwVlJEUm9pTzJSMkZqNUxDbWdwMGItaHlUSS1YckQ5ejlHdVBzMERaZVZEdXEwczJUc256bw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.playstation.com%2Fconcept..&amp;v=cnt7N3H49IE">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">EGS</a> platforms and bringing a 1.3 "Golden Update" to them all. Steam Deck compatibility is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571?l=english">on its way to Verified</a>, with a bunch of handheld niceties already in place.</p>
<p>The Golden Update grants new and existing players a procedurally generated sandbox mode to complement the game's (also generated) campaign, new weapons and armor, crossplay between all platforms with up to eight players, specific sliders for difficulty settings, and… a pause function in offline single-player, which seemingly was not there before.</p>

<p>What are you actually&nbsp;<em>doing</em> in&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>? You, a dwarf in the Fourth Age of Middle-Earth, are tasked by Gimli Lockbearer with heading into Moria (i.e. Khazad-dûm) to recover its treasures. Except every Moria is different, generated from random generation seeds. You mine for materials, use materials to make gear and goods, set up base camps with stations and fixtures, and, of course, fight the things you awaken in the depths.</p>

<p>Not only does a release on new cross-compatible platforms give you a chance to check out a potentially overlooked gem, but this is also version 1.3 of the game. Reviews of the game at release in October 2023 were closely aligned around one point: it needed more time to cook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review/">PC Gamer</a> found the game authentic to Tolkien's lore, intriguing in its depictions of underground spaces, and alternately goofy and harrowing in building and fighting. But bugs, stuttering, clipping errors, and disbelief-shattering oddities brought the experience down a good deal.&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> was more critical of the game's tile-based layouts and laborious backtracking. "A few patches could see this become a survival game that can hold its own against the more popular entries in the genre," wrote Ford James.</p>
<p>In a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIZ3f5cL6l0&amp;t=33s">Quality of Life Showcase</a>," Game Director Jon-Paul Dumont details how the game has advanced over the past 10 months. The map is color-coded and easier to read, the ambient music and transitions are improved, combat improvements make it feel better and more grounded (another point of review contention), and player gripes about inventory management, cooking, building, and crafting have been tackled.</p>
<p>I haven't played enough of the game to render any kind of verdict on it, but I'm always eager to see the work of a team actively fixing after launch—digging in, if you will.</p>

		<p>Staff at development studio Spiders, developers of Greedfall and Steerlrising, have released an open letter to state they will be going on strike next week. The reasons for the strike action include management ignoring staff requests, pay disparity based on gender, high turnover, and poor employee support. In addition, staff have stated that the environment had led to problems on the development of Greedfall 2 and another, yet to be announced project.</p>
<p>The letter from the Spiders team, which can be read below, has been published by STJV, an independent French union which represents people working in the videogames industry.</p>


<p><em>This letter to our management follows an earlier open letter and a strike on January 19, which management has chosen not to ignore. Since then, new negotiations have begun on wages, and conditions in the studio have continued to deteriorate. Today, it is with regret that we speak out publicly, in the hope that this will finally push management to act in the best interests of employees and the company.</em></p>
<p><em>This document covers several years of known problems, which have been greatly amplified over the past year with the arrival of the current head of the company : instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.</em></p>
<p><em>As of August 27, 2024, this letter has been signed by 44 workers at Spiders, out of 95.</em></p>

<p><em>We had demanded that the head of the company receive a delegation of Spiders’ workers to discuss all these points. She accepted, the delegation came to a meeting on August 27 and then waited in vain for the management to come, which it never did.</em></p>
<h2><em>Call for strike action during the week of September 2</em></h2>
<p><em>In light of management’s continued refusal to discuss, take the problems raised seriously and act to rectify them,&nbsp;we are calling on Spiders workers to go on strike during the week of September 2, 2024, on the basis of the demands set out above.</em></p>
<p><em>In particular, we will be organizing&nbsp;pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a Minecraft server&nbsp;created for the occasion.</em></p>
<p><em>We are inviting our relatives, friends, supporters, workers in the industry in general, journalists and political actors to join us at the pickets.</em></p>
<p><em>To help us strike, and if you have the means to do so, you can make a donation to the STJV strike fund, which has been activated for this strike at the request of the STJV section.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/stjv-strike-fund/">Instructions on how to donate can be found on this page</a>. Don’t hesitate to specify “Spiders” in the reference of your transfer. We’ll keep track of the sums paid to workers.</em></p>
<p><em>Workers at Spiders face many difficulties:</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>GROWING INSTABILITY</b>, because it is impossible for us to: know where we will be able to live in the future, know whether we will be able to have a fulfilling personal life, anticipate our long-term evolution at Spiders. But also because of low wages and a lack of certainty about increases over the next few years.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>A COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO ANTICIPATING PROBLEMS AND SECURING WORKING CONDITIONS</b>&nbsp;due to : an ideological stance held by the company’s management and its refusal to acknowledge issues, the rolling back, for no good reason, of arrangements that had been in place for years, as well as rising pressure on the workers’ shoulders.</em></p>
<p><em>►<b>&nbsp;GLOBAL MISMANAGEMENT:&nbsp;</b>the studio tripling in size in 3 years and the launch of two lines of production side-by-side were, in all likelihood, not anticipated or planned for by the company. Its structure has evolved very little, if at all.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>GROWING TURNOVER AND RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS:</b>&nbsp;many veteran workers are leaving the company. In response, the company is making little efforts to try and retain them, to find suitable in-house successors, or to make the company attractive to hiring prospects.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN ACHIEVING GENDER EQUALITY AND PARITY:</b>&nbsp;the gender balance at Spiders remains well below the already low industry average, and women employee’s average wage is considerably lower than men’s.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>A BLATANT LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY:</b>&nbsp;its management, budgets, plannings, financial health, working conditions… The company’s strategy remains unknown, no explanation is given for decisions imposed, and their source is often hidden from us.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>PROBLEMS ARE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, AND THEIR VERY EXISTENCE DENIED:</b>&nbsp;despite having been brought up with management for years through every possible channel, problems are either ignored or worse, their very existence is outright denied and questioned.</em></p>
<p><em>►<b>&nbsp;A DIFFICULT PRODUCTION CYCLE FOR GREEDFALL 2:&nbsp;</b>as a direct consequence of these problems, there is widespread anxiety and a loss of interest among employees. For many, it translates into a fear of releasing a disappointing game at the end and/or a feeling of shame over their own work. For some, it’s the last straw that pushes them to look for work elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>MANAGEMENT’S ADAMANT REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE COLLECTIVE ACTION:&nbsp;</b>at the slightest opportunity, management is reducing everything to confidential individual negotiation, accentuating inequalities between workers and paving the way for discrimination and abuse.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>MANAGEMENT’S SENSELESS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT WORKER REPRESENTATION:&nbsp;</b>they challenge and belittle the legitimacy of staff representatives and collective expression in any shape or form, while also refusing to consult workers themselves.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>NEGOTIATIONS WITH NO POSSIBLE COMPROMISES:&nbsp;</b>the mission of workers’ representatives, as well as negotiations on wages and work from home, are impeded by the management’s infantilizing contempt for workers and its refusal to enforce its obligations, particularly when it comes to sharing information.</em></p>
<p>A much longer and detailed letter has also been published by STJV, and t<a href="https://www.stjv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Open-letter-to-Spiders-management-public-version.pdf">hat letter can be accessed at this link</a>. Spiders has been contacted for comment about the upcoming strike, and we will publish the studio’s response if and when we receive one.</p>

<div>
<div><p>Today, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> went live. The campaign is to produce new expansions for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Old Gods of Appalachia</em> TTRPG</a>, which was successfully crowdfunded on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-backed-in-11-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter last year</a>. Like that initial campaign, this campaign was fully funded on day one, doubling its initial funding goal.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> will produce three new books for the Old Gods of Appalachia TTRPG. In addition, the campaign provides new licensed accessories as add-ons.</p>

It is a supplement with new player options, including new foci, backgrounds, equipment, and player intrusions. <em>All Your Gods Are Dead</em> is a GM supplement filled with new NPCs, cyphers, and artifacts. The third book is <em>Come Hell Or High Water</em>, a prewritten adventure book.</p>
<p>For hardcore fans, <em>Come Hell or High Water</em> will include new material on various sites from the original podcast.

<p>At Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 20, one of the biggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcements was the confirmation</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was heading to PlayStation 5 (PS5). Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Indiana Jones creative director Axel Torvenius and design director Jens Andersson spoke of the game coming to PS5 and their thoughts on the move.</p>



<p>Neither person would go into details on the decision making behind bringing the game to PS5 after its console exclusivity window with Xbox ends. Rather, they focused on the excitement of it simply happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-studio-thinks-of-indiana-jones-on-ps5">What The Studio Thinks Of Indiana Jones On PS5</h2>



<p>“From MachineGames’ point of view, we are super thrilled and excited over the fact we will be able to be on PlayStation next year as well,” Torvenius said. “The more people that can play the game – who can see all the passion and love we have put into this project and all the hard work – the merrier.”</p>



<p>Andersson added that it’s something the studio wanted to do from the start. He also said that the extra time after the game’s launch in December gives them more time to prepare it for the PS5 while clarifying that the technology used for development can handle multiple platforms.</p>



<p>“This is also the opportunity to mention our technology is based on id Tech,” he said. “We have our own, modified, version of id Tech, but it is originally a multi-platform engine. So we have a great start to it already.”</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on December 9</a> for Xbox Series X|S and PC.

<p>PGL has officially announced its Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) 2025 and 2026 schedules, preparing gamers for an intense two years of esports action with the popular shooter. Being one of the largest esports tournament-hosting organizations in the world, PGL plans to deliver the CS2 competition fans will want (and need).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stand-aside-esl-pgl-plans-to-take-over-the-cs2-scene">Stand Aside ESL, PGL Plans To Take Over The CS2 Scene</h2>



<p>With ESL holding a large majority of the massive esports events, it seems like many other organizations, such as PGL, are planning to indulge in the CS2 scene. The popular first-person shooter has had a hold on gamers for over a decade now, making it one of the most popular esports out there. The game also has some of the largest prize pools in the industry.</p>



<p>PGL plans to host various Tier 1 tournaments throughout the globe starting in 2025. Here is their schedule for the next two years.</p>



<h4 id="h-pgl-2025-cs2-competitive-schedule">PGL 2025 CS2 Competitive Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>PGL on FiRe Buenos Aires 2025</strong>: February 13th – 23rd – Teatro Gran Rex</li>



<li><strong>PGL Bucharest 2025</strong>: April 3rd – 13th – PGL Studios</li>



<li><strong>PGL Astana 2025</strong>: May 8th – 18th – Barys Arena</li>



<li><strong>PGL Belgrade 2025</strong>: October 23rd – November 2nd – Belgrade Arena</li>



<li><strong>PW CAC 2025</strong>: October 1st – 23rd – Location TBD </li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<h4 id="h-pgl-2026-cs2-competitive-schedule">PGL 2026 CS2 Competitive Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>PGL on FiRe Buenos Aires 2026</strong>&nbsp;– February 12th – 22nd – Estadio Mary Terán de Weiss</li>



<li><strong>PGL Bucharest 2026</strong>&nbsp;– April 2nd – 12th – PGL Studios</li>



<li><strong>PGL Astana 2026</strong>: May 7th – 17th – Barys Arena</li>



<li><strong>PGL Belgrade 2026</strong>: August 6th – 16th – Belgrade Arena</li>



<li><strong>PGL on FiRe São Paulo</strong>: October 1st – 11th – Location TBD</li>



<li><strong>PGL Barcelona 2026:</strong>&nbsp;October 22nd – November 1st – Location TBD</li>
</ul>



<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>The competitive schedule begins this upcoming February (2025), with plenty of massive tournaments happening throughout the next few years. </p>



<p>With most major Counter-Strike tournaments transitioning to CS2, and many players quitting because of it, it will be interesting to see where the competitive season goes from here. </p>

It's now called Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it's coming out in spring of next year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Guardians of Azuma takes place in, well, Azuma, a land that underwent something called the "Celestial Collapse" some time ago. Since that time, the four seasons have yet to return to the land. You play as a hero who awakens with no memories and is greeted by Woolby, a creature with a connection to the dragon god. As an earth dancer, your job is to restore nature to Azuma and bring back the missing runes.</p><p>It's Rune Factory, so you'll spend a lot of time sprucing up a farm and various other locations, all while bringing back the seasons and the gods that govern them. You'll rebuild villages inspired by traditional Japan, and unlock various new and returning festivals. We got glimpses of what may be marriageable townsfolk and the marriage ceremony itself, too. And as usual, there are two possible protagonists, a man and a woman, but you can befriend or romance any eligible bachelor regardless of gender.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The 10 Best Tactics RPGs</h3></div></output><p>Unlike the numbered Rune Factory games, Guardians of Azuma seems to have far, far more of a combat-focus and the trailer showcases a number of action sequences and plots revolving around the conflict between two sides, and two dragons. It looks like we even get to ride one of them.</p><p>There's a lot to appreciate in the Guardians of Azuma trailer, and it certainly looks like an upgrade from Rune Factory 5, especially in the combat department. I <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rune-factory-5-review">gave Rune Factory 5 a 6/10 in my review</a>, saying it had "much of the mechanical depth that made its predecessor so enjoyable, but none of the improvements one would expect from a leap to a new, more powerful platform." </p><p>Hopefully Guardians of Azuma turns out to be an improvement in more than just appearance when it launches in the spring.

<p>A combination documentary and classic game compilation called <em>Tetris Forever</em> is headed to PC, Nintendo Switch, and other platforms later this year, according to an announcement.</p>
<p>The game will include 15 Tetris games, from an "accurate" version of the first <em>Tetris</em> for the Electronika 60 to an NES version of the game and more, including <em>Tetris 2 + Bombliss</em>, <em>Super Tetris 3</em>, and <em>Tetris Battle Gaiden</em>, among others.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it will feature a new take called <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which will see players jumping "between gameplay styles from across the series" in real time as they complete each board. The game will support up to four players.</p>
<p>The game is developed by Digital Eclipse, which previously made waves with a docu-game called <em>The Making of Karateka</em> that combined the classic game with documentary footage. It also made a remaster of the original <em>Wizardry</em>.
</p><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is the latest in the same docu-game series that included <em>The Making of Karateka</em>. As such, the classic games will be presented in an interactive digital museum-like format and will be accompanied by over an hour of documentary clips "about the history of <em>Tetris</em> and its key players."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p><em>Tetris Forever</em> was announced as part of a Nintendo Direct stream this morning. The reveal focused on the experience of playing the game on the Nintendo Switch and also noted that the original NES version of <em>Tetris</em> is coming to Nintendo Switch Online's classic game library this winter.</p>
<p>However, the game also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/">appeared on Steam</a>, so there will be a PC release. Releases on other consoles are likely as well. The Steam page says the game is coming sometime before the end of this year but doesn't get more specific than that. There's no pricing information yet, either.</p>

                <p>Comic book fans--and especially superhero fans--have a reputation for paying attention to even the smallest details of a hero's costume. But the latest update for Insomniac's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man 2</a> includes a detail that few superhero devotees would have even noticed. Yet some fans did notice, and Insomniac credits the community feedback for the change.</p><p>Via <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/29656891831309-Version-1-003-001-Release-Notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insomniac's home page</a>, Peter Parker's suit from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been slightly modified. The soles of the costume have now been changed from red to black to better reflect the outfit as depicted in the film. It's a minor change in the grand scheme of things, but Insomniac still went ahead and made it alongside some other small fixes.</p><p>The current update also addresses an issue with Spider-Man's Last Stand and Webbed suits where the Spider logo clipped through the chest and back, respectively. Additionally, Insomniac states that the update has "additional stability and fixes" and should remedy a commonly reported crash. Beyond that, there isn't anything else cited in the current update.</p><p>Spider-Man 2 players are also eager to see if the game will be getting any additional DLC story drops. Marvel's Spider-Man launched in 2018 with an announcement that its three-part DLC, The City That Never Sleeps, would follow shortly thereafter. Sony and Insomniac have yet to announce any similar plans for Spider-Man 2. The inevitable sequel may still be a few years away, but Insomniac is working on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Wolverine</a> game in the meantime..</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-2024-a-record-breaking-year-for-the-world-s-largest-games-event<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2024, held from August 20th to 24th, once again affirmed its status as the world's premier gaming event. The event attracted a staggering 335,000 visitors from around 120 countries to Cologne, reflecting the increasingly globalized nature of the games industry. As well as the vast consumer show, Gamescom also welcomed over 32,000 trade visitors this year and featured close to 1,500 exhibitors from 64 countries, with 48 national pavilions showcasing the international diversity of the gaming ecosystem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devcom, Gamescom's sister event focused on the developer community, also hit new heights, with 5,000 visitors, representing over 1,600 companies from 83 countries. This was a 45% increase compared to 2023. Meanwhile, Gamescom boasted a record-breaking online engagement, particularly with its Opening Night Live, which garnered over 40 million video views – double the number from the previous year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The growth of the show has been greatly assisted by the increasing presence of a wider range of global companies. Whereas in the past, most of the interest in the show was driven by traditional Western and Japanese publishers, these days Chinese and Korean companies like Mihoyo, Kingsoft, and Krafton provide some of the biggest attractions on the show floor. The increased prominence of emerging players from regions like China, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia is signaling a shift in industry dynamics.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Global publishers take the lead">Global publishers take the lead</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The increasing presence of these new players has been particularly crucial in light of the decreasing focus on physical events by many of the industry's traditional giants. Both Sony and Nintendo opted to skip Gamescom this year, with Microsoft the only platform holder opting to invest in a large presence on the expo floor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, however, this was a sign of the increasingly divergent strategy being pursued by Xbox compared to the other two console platforms. The most striking aspect of Xbox's vast booth was the presence of numerous third-party games. Titles from Ubisoft, Epic Games, and Mihoyo were prominently featured, with no distinction drawn between first-party and third-party-games—a physical representation of Xbox's content-first strategy, which was further emphasized by the announcement that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be released on PlayStation 5 a few months after its Xbox launch later this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These moves are part of a steady shift from a hardware-centric approach to a broader focus on establishing Xbox as a leading games publisher. This is a move that feels very much in keeping with the content-first focus of Gamescom which has been enthusiastically embraced by Korean and Chinese publishers who have now firmly taken their place as leading draws for Gamescom visitors. This year's event saw Tencent-owned Funcom revealed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dune: Awakening</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an open-world survival game based on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dune</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> books and movies, and NetEase showcased </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a multiplayer shooter leveraging Marvel's popular IP. Meanwhile forthcoming Korean releases </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Berserker: Khazan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mecha BREAK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> attracted large crowds despite having no existing IP to lean on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chinese games companies are increasingly focused on international expansion, driven in part by the uncertain regulatory environment at home. Unpredictable game approval processes and strict limits on playtime for younger players are major sources of volatility. To navigate these challenges, Chinese studios are pursuing a strategy of hedging against domestic uncertainty by marketing their games overseas and investing in and acquiring Western developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A more recent development is the direct launch of new titles by Chinese developers in international markets. However, this strategy comes with significant challenges, as localization requires more than just language translation. Adapting game design, user interfaces, and monetization strategies to suit Western tastes is crucial. While mobile gaming dominates in China, Western markets have a stronger focus on PC and console, further complicating these companies' global ambitions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A prime example of Chinese games making waves internationally is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was first showcased at Gamescom last year. The game generated significant buzz, with visitors waiting up to five hours to try the demo. Released during the week of Gamescom 2024, it quickly became the second-most popular title ever on Steam, reaching 2.1 million concurrent players on its launch date. Although Steam data indicates that most players are based in China, the game's global appeal is undeniable, marking a significant milestone in the international success of Chinese-developed games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="AI becomes increasingly visible">AI becomes increasingly visible</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of these same players are also at the forefront of one of the biggest trends visible at Gamescom this year: the growing adoption of AI. While controversies around copyright, job replacement, and other issues has led most Western developers to take a cautious stance towards AI, it's increasingly clear that Asian companies are pursuing more aggressive experimentation with a variety of AI technologies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nvidia used the event to showcase its ACE "digital human" technology which has been used by Chinese developer Perfect World and Korea's Seasun to create player-facing conversational AI agents. Perfect World's implementation—which is just a tech demo for now—featured a fully-animated 3D character called Yun Ni capable of engaging in fairly complex conversation in English or Chinese and reading visual cues via webcam. However, the cloud-based model based on Open AI's GPT-4o introduced a large amount of latency, which together with Yun Ni's rather wooden delivery made anything approaching natural dialog impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another ACE demo featured a live production game, Seasun's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mecha BREAK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is set for release in 2025 and was one of the biggest attractions on the show floor this year. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mecha BREAK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the AI model runs locally rather than from the cloud. But while this alleviates latency issues, it means relying on a significantly less powerful language model which is noticeably less accurate in understanding inputs and less able to offer relevant and naturalistic answers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given these limitations, Seasun has positioned its AI-powered character as an in-game assistant—more a replacement for wiki pages than a full-blown character. A similar implementation is being used in Krafton's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inzoi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where the game's cat mascot leverages AI to answer player queries. Ultimately, this is a fairly limited first step towards conversational AI agents which will provide some novelty and perhaps a modicum of convenience but is clearly far short of revolutionary. It's notable too that the limiting factor in the above cases towards fuller application of player-facing is the capacity of the technology itself rather than the willingness of developers to leverage it. Krafton and Seasun are pushing the tech as far as it will go right now and the results at this point are not that exciting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, it's far more likely that a bigger impact will be seen on game production rather than eye-catching live in-game implementations. A recent high-profile example is the use of AI voicework in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Finals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Embark Studios (which is majority-owned by South Korea's Nexon) controversially used AI to generate in-game voiceovers, but the AI-generated lines are pre-recorded, not generated on the fly. Whatever the ethics of this approach, it does have the major upsides of there being no need for the game to share resources with an AI model and ensuring the developers have full control over the in-game content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though most companies are opting for a low-profile approach to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-2024-a-record-breaking-year-for-the-world-s-largest-games-event#_msocom_1">[GJ1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-2024-a-record-breaking-year-for-the-world-s-largest-games-event#_msocom_2">[LD2]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;their AI experiments, there is no doubt that the use of various forms of AI in game development is spreading rapidly. There were several AI tool startups visible in the B2B area of the show like Scenario (asset generation) and X&amp;Immersion (voice and dialogue)—just two of more than 100 companies offering AI tools for game development tracked in Omdia's latest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Games Tech Market Landscape.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a combined consumer and trade event, Gamescom's ability to crystalize a wide variety of trends from the globalization of the publishing landscape, to the growth and limits of AI at a single event is a key element of its continued success. While it may host fewer blockbuster announcements than the expos of the past, the show's value to the industry is in many ways greater than ever.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

            <p>
Clive Sinclair's ZX Spectrum is a truly iconic bit of 80s computer design, and readers of a certain age will have the opportunity to relive a youth spent palpating its rubber keys this November, when it returns to homes - with a bunch of included classic games and modern niceties thrown in - courtesy of Retro Games, the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-an-atari-400-mini-coming-in-march-with-25-included-games">this year's Atari 400 Mini</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Spectrum (as Retro Games is calling its new bit of old-school-inspired hardware) takes its design cues from the unforgettable 48K, with its rubber keys and iconic rainbow stripe - but, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-the-spectrum-is-a-modern-love-letter-to-an-80s-computer-legend-rubber-keys-and-all/">per VGC</a>, its innards are a little more multi-generational, capable of emulating all the classic Spectrum variants: the 16K, 48K, Spectrum+ (AKA my first home computer), and 128K.
</p>
<p>
Notably, The Spectrum's rubber keyboard is fully functional, and there's support for a wide variety of USB controller devices, meaning purchasers have a decent number of options when it comes to playing its 48 bundled games - which include bona fide classics such as Head Over Heels, Jack the Nipper, Manic Miner, The Hobbit, Auf Wiedersehen Monty, and Skool Daze.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="The Spectrum | Announce Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOVAtqkHl1w?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
And if you've got a personal favourite not on the included list (hi Kokotoni Wilf and Pyjamarama), The Spectrum can also play your legally acquired Spectrum ROMs from a USB stick, with the likes of .z80, .tap, and .tzx file formats all supported. Furthermore, BASIC programming is possible on the machine, meaning I can finally finish typing up <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTZ0xkNW5Id3NLVVk/view?resourcekey=0-zd1AmVtIaboWogtXloOIxA">The Mystery of Silver Mountain</a> 40 years after I started.
</p>
<p>
In terms of more modern-day niceties, The Spectrum can output at 720p via HDMI, with PAL (50Hz) and NTSC (60Hz) compatibility, and it support 4:3 and pixel perfect aspect ratios. 12 frames are available to surround gameplay, and the machine also features CRT filters and configurable border sizes. Additionally, four save slots are available per game, and it's possible to rewind gameplay by up to 40 seconds - meaning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-willy">Jet Set Willy</a>'s Entrance to Hades need no longer be a one-way trip.
</p>
<p>
And if all that's tickled your nostalgia nubbin, The Spectrum - which also comes bundled with a 32-page Crash mini-magazine featuring reviews and articles - will cost £89.99/€99.99 when it launches on 22nd November. And here's a full list of those included games:

		<p>Team17 has announced Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition for Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, celebrating the game’s 25th anniversary on 26th September.</p>

<p>Having come out all the way back in 1999, Worms Armageddon is still considered by many Worms fans to be the high point of the series and it quite impressively still clings onto a daily player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/217200/charts/">a few hundred people on Steam</a>. It’s continued to outshine the potentially better for online play Worms World Party, which had a remaster a few years ago, and level pegs with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/22/worms-wmd-review/">Worms WMD</a>, which is also a fine take on the classic 2D form that is somehow already 8 years old!</p>
<p>This Anniversary Edition takes the PC game and gives it the once over with modern improvements and touches to work on console – the game has actually had periodic updates on PC <a href="https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/">as recently as 2022</a>.</p>
<p>These bonus features and upgrades include:</p>

<ul>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Optimized controller support for all consoles.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Achievements and Trophies</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> New display features such as modern aspect ratios, custom screen filters, enhanced HD and graphics options.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Fully playable Game Boy Color version of Worms Armageddon</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> An interactive museum that charts the history of the entire series. Featuring never-before-seen interviews with developers of the original and current games.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> New save system</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to head online, you’ll be able to play with up to six players teaming up or competing. The only caveat is that there’s not cross-play, so Switch, PlayStation and Xbox gamers are being kept separate – cross-gen play is possible, though.</p>

<p>The original Epic Mickey was released in 2010 for the Nintendo Wii. It was developed by the now-closed Junction Point Studios. The remaster of the game is being developed by Purple Lamp and Disney Games. The game’s original director Warren Spector helped with this new version of the game. As part of the remake, the game was developed in Unreal Engine as opposed to the Gamebryo engine from the first title.</p>







<p>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed launches on September 24 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>Aside from the numerous optimization issues plaguing the overall experience, one thing stood out when I first started playing Star Wars Outlaws. The controls felt awkward and strange for some reason, but I couldn’t quite understand why. Then, it hit me. They’ve swapped standard controls. You use the analog sticks to interact with everyone and everything, which feels cumbersome and unintuitive. Thankfully, you can change your controls in Star Outlaws, and yes, it does make a difference!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-change-controls-in-star-wars-outlaws">How to Change Controls in Star Wars Outlaws</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you can swap controls by opening your game’s pause menu, selecting <strong>Settings</strong>, and then navigating to <strong>Controls</strong>. From there, choose <strong>Show Controller Layout</strong>, and hit ‘RB” on your controller to switch from Default to <strong>Alternate</strong>. It’s a simple tweak that <strong>swaps the Melee from X to Right Stick and Interact from Right Stick to X</strong>.</p>



<p>By default, most games have the interact action tied to one of the face buttons, which makes it more intuitive to access quests, pick up items, and interact with the environment. But in Star Wars Outlaws, they opted for having the player click on the right analog stick, which doesn’t feel good, for lack of a better descriptor.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-use-a-controller-or-mouse-and-keyboard-for-star-wars-outlaws">Should You Use a Controller or Mouse and Keyboard for Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>If you’re playing on a PC, you have options. You can play with a controller or mouse and keyboard, both of which work well. However, from personal experience playing the game, I can tell you that it feels like Outlaws was designed from the ground up as a console title. As such, a controller feels more responsible and intuitive.</p>



<p>I recommend trying the game out with a controller to see how it feels. While you can certainly aim more accurately with a mouse and keyboard, movement, flying, and driving feel better with a controller. </p>

<p>Much of the game revolves around understanding the various controls, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-lockpick-star-wars-outlaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking mini-game</a>. Use what works best for you!</p>
