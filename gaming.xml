              <p><span>One of the best ways to get someone into a hero shooter is to compare a character they don’t know to one they have intimate knowledge with. I haven’t played a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-campaign-master-chief-release-date-2000651439"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>game</span></a><span> in over a decade, so I didn’t clock that Emre, one of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-new-heroes-story-sigma-dialogue-sombra-talon-2000667771"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s new heroes</span></a><span>, feels a lot like Master Chief from Bungie’s classic shooters. But some friends I was playing with last night made the comparison, and then I woke up this morning to find the internet is </span><a href="https://x.com/bentoDRAWS/status/2021347046469533930?s=20"><span>running wild with it</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very nice of them to add a Halo guy to Overwatch <a href="https://t.co/3IKSLenHXQ">pic.twitter.com/3IKSLenHXQ</a></p> <p>— bento (comms open!!) (@bentoDRAWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/bentoDRAWS/status/2021347046469533930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Emre is definitely cut from the Soldier: 76 cloth in that his kit is one of the more straightforward shooter movesets in the game. He’s got a three-round burst rifle on which he can aim down sights without losing any of his movement speed, a side arm that fires explosive rounds and makes him run fast, and an ultimate that lets him fly and rain fire down on his enemies. But he also has frag grenades that bounce around just like Master Chief’s do in </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, and both those and his rifle seem to be immediately activating long-dormant muscle memory for those who haven’t played as Microsoft’s mascot for a bit.</span></p>

   <p><span>If you upgrade his perks accordingly, Emre’s grenade can also stick to enemies, much like the plasma grenades from </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, so the comparisons just keep coming. If you were considering getting into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>after its soft reboot</span></a><span> this week and don’t know who to pick first, Emre might be an easy place to start. There are 50 heroes now with varying degrees of complexity, and starting with more simple heroes is a good way to acclimate yourself to all the chaos. Just don’t panic when you see </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163"><span>a flying cat</span></a><span> carrying a giant German man with a hammer over the battlefield.</span></p>

Over 70 different styles are currently on sale, with prices ranging from $529 to $634 after a $50 off instant discount across the entire lineup.

In celebration of the event, Secretlab has discounted two Genshin themed chairs inspired by Liyue characters: Xiao, an anemo adeptus, and Ningguang, the geo-wielding Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing (she's basically a royal).

Even so, these chairs are so cool that they're worth a mention. These chairs showcase one of three iconic Pokémon - Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee - with ostentatious use of color, patterns, and figures. My personal favorite is the Eevee edition, with its detailed embossing of Eevee's myriad evolutions; it also seems to be the top seller, since it's already on its third wave of preorders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unusual for a collab, Secretlab opted to go with its Softweave Plus fabric instead of leatherette, and I for one am happy with that decision.

The publisher and distributor announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2673080/view/491590284956666227?l=english">Steam</a> (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mema6bshls25">Wario64</a>) earlier today.</p>
<p>From <strong>31st March 2026</strong>, you'll no longer be able to purchase the game digitally. However, if you already own it (physically or digitally) or buy it before 31st March, you'll be able to redownload and play it at any point.</p>
<p>No reason for the delisting was given, but it's likely due to licensing rights expiring, similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bill_and_teds_excellent_retro_collection">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/bill-and-teds-excellent-retro-collection-is-about-to-be-delisted-on-the-switch-eshop">a few years back</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067onhvlt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's Limited Run Games' statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to give you an early heads-up that the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection will no longer be available for purchase on digital storefronts after March 31, 2026.</p>
<p>If you already purchased the game, don’t worry — you’ll still be able to redownload and play it anytime.</p>
<p>In the past, we learned how important it is to provide plenty of notice for changes like this, so we’re committed to being as open and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>Our goal is to give fans every opportunity to grab the game before it’s too late. Thanks for understanding!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jurassic Park: Classic Games Collection came to Switch on 22nd November 2023, so by the time it gets removed from the eShop, it'll have only been out for around two years and four months. The games included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic Park (NES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the Collection perhaps <em>isn't</em> the best showing for the iconic dinosaur franchise, but it's a time capsule of 8 - and 16-bit games made in the wake of the 1993 movie's huge success. We acknowledged this as much in our review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection">scoring the selection a 6/10</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Devs Dance While Striking: ‘Yves Guillemot Has No Knowledge Or Understanding Of His Company’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-strike-assassins-creed-delay-cancel-rto-layoffs-2000667820</link>
            <guid>1432930</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ubisoft developers are striking outside the company’s Paris offices this week. Over 1,200 of them, according to union reps. They’re dancing, too, as they call on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maker to reverse its controversial return-to-office policy and call for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">accountability from its top executives</a>, including co-founder Yves Guillemot.</p> <p>“At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees,” Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris Marc Rutschlé <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>.&nbsp;“The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year.”</p>

 <p>On February 10, the first day of the this week’s strike, speakers were blaring the 2014 Game Boy chiptune banger “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/kenobit/kenobit-disco-sanwa-2014">Disco Sanwa” by Kenobit</a>. Developers danced even in the rain while protesting the direction of the company.</p>   <p>The three-day strike this week includes developers at Ubisoft Milan as well and comes after the French publisher announced a new emergency pivot that included delaying some big games and cancelling many others. In addition to a fresh cost-cutting program that amounts to another 200 layoffs, and annual raises that have shrunk during hard times, Ubisoft is calling for employees to go back to being in the office full-time by the end of 2026.</p>

 <p>That message, delivered by CEO Yves Guillemot in an internal email and recent townhall meetings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">has gone over like a lead balloon</a>, not least of all because of the person who’s delivering it. Despite saying the company needs to change and evolve, Guillemot and his brothers, who founded it back in the 1980s, remain in charge thanks in part to a $1 billion bailout by Tencent.</p>

 <p>One employee in Canada <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-montreal-lead-fired-david-michaud-cromp-work-from-home-linkedin-2000665081">was fired for the way he criticized the new policies</a> in work channels, which Ubisoft said violated the company’s code of conduct. Unlike France, Ubisoft’s major Canadian studios in Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto are not unionized.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>, the god-simulator from Fable creator Peter Molyneux, launches on April 22, and ahead of the game's PC release, developer 22 Cans has released nearly seven minutes of all-new gameplay in an extended trailer. The game, which puts players in control of a god-like hand to master real-time strategy, town management, and simulation, also lets players become one of their villages' many NPCs to explore, fight, explore dungeons, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a taste of all that and more in the new trailer, and you can check it out below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," the trailer's description reads. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In Masters of Albion, there is no single solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, wherever. Kill or carry, crush or coax. You are the ultimate power."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Masters of Albion will be Molyneux's final game, as he and 22 Cans said <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB&amp;v=CSLGKKAuZwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">when the team announced it during Gamescom 2024</a>. Molyneux, who is the mind behind Populous and Black and White, as well as Fable (the original), said Masters of Albion is "the culmination of my life's work" back when the game was first announced.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bolder-braver-bloodier-ci-games-digs-into-lords-of-the-fallen-2-combat-in-new-developer-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>1432870</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>CI Games</strong> is getting ready to release its third <strong>Lords of the Fallen</strong> game with <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, sometime later this year, which we last got a look at during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong> with a new gameplay trailer. Outside of CI Games' chief executive officer, <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong>, promising that this <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-wont-be-politically-correct-will-feature-attractive-females-skimpy-armors/">fantasy action game won't be "<em>politically correct</em>"</a> and that it will feature female characters in revealing armour, in a new developer deep-dive, game director <strong>James Lowe</strong> promises that the combat will be <strong><em>"bolder, braver, bloodier</em>."</strong></p>



<p>A quick rundown on the series, if you're confused as to why the game with the '2' at the end of it is actually the third in the franchise. In 2014, CI Games released <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">Lords of the Fallen</a>,</strong> an action RPG that failed to really make a big splash. Almost a decade later, the studio decided to reboot the series and released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen (2023)</strong></a>, which, despite its myriad of issues at launch, fared far better. The game's commercial success was enough to drive CI Games to make a sequel, which brings us to Lords of the Fallen 2, due out sometime in 2026, not to be confused with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2.0</strong></a>, which refers to the massive overhaul update CI Games put out almost two years after the 2023 reboot to fix it.</p>



<p>Getting back to today's combat deep-dive, as part of the studio's Lifting the Veil series on its official YouTube channel, CI Games put out a nearly 42-minute video discussing and showcasing how it is improving and updating combat in Lords of the Fallen 2, trying to address players' concerns from its predecessor while also introducing new elements for the sequel.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lords of the Fallen II: ‘Lifting the Veil’ Ep. 8 Dev Update | All-New Combat Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlPH5v0vT6A?start=134&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some of the highlights about combat that Lowe discusses alongside lead systems designer <strong>Daniel Regan</strong>, producer <strong>Alex Harkin</strong>, and creative strategist <strong>Ryan Hill</strong> include how the team is doubling down on things players loved from the 2023 reboot, like dual-wielding, a great emphasis on players' speed and maneuverability, and a slew of new animations to make combat feel more varied than it did in 2023.</p>



<p>It's not just a greater variety in animations, but in weapon choices, as CI Games is focusing on letting players swap seamlessly between melee attacks to spell casting and back, while also trying out the barrage of new weapons.</p>



<p>The panel discussion is altogether an honest conversation about how the studio is trying to improve and fix the mistakes it made in previous entries. It's clear that CI Games wants to make this game hit in a way that its previous games never did, which is ultimately an exciting proposition for anyone looking forward to checking out this upcoming action RPG.</p>



<p>Another point that Lowe references in the panel is wanting to "<em>respect the player's time</em>," which was something that he told Wccftech that he and the team wanted to focus on back in December 2025, when we got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/respect-the-players-time-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-game-director-james-lowe-discusses-key-principles-defining-the-game-interview/">sit down with him for an interview</a> following its gameplay showcase at The Game Awards. </p>

<p>In other Fortnite news, it’s been reported that jam tracks, including Eminem’s “The Real Slim Shady,” “FE!N” by Travis Scott, and “Bye Bye Bye,” have been potentially scrapped.</p>

And, according to Takuto Edagawa, the game's director, it sounds like we'll be spending a <em>lot</em> of time rebuilding this abandoned island with our Pokémon.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">IGN</a>, Edagawa — who works at Koei Tecmo and previously worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> and directed the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts</a> — said that the main aim of the game "is typically not to go to the end roll", meaning the credits.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fprtkiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it'll be about <strong>20 to 40 hours</strong>, but it would really depend on how the players play the game", he told the outlet.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a pretty chunky game, even if you just focus on the main stuff. And for reference, the Dragon Quest Builders games, which Pokopia seems to be closely-aligned with, are a little longer at 40-50+ hours.</p>
<p>And, as you probably expect from a game like Pokopia, there's a <em>lot</em> more to do than just "roll credits", which Edagawa confirms: "There's more things to experience after the end roll... I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game."</p>

<p>Unsurprising stuff, but that confirms we'll be booking out our March to sit down and thoroughly dedicate ourselves to island rebuilding and repopulating.</p>
<p>When our very own Ollie Reynolds got to play Pokopia, he came away extremely surprised and impressed, and for cosy gamers, he had this to say: "I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p>

<p>No one saw the huge rebranding of Overwatch coming in 2026, and the revised identity comes with plenty of actual new identities. We’re taking a look at every new character, the voice actors behind the fresh-faced heroes, and more.</p>



<p>Aside from the rather unfortunate business surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch’s Anran undergoing a redesign after community backlash</a>, the new cast of characters has been well-received, particularly a certain flying feline.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-heroes-added-in-2026">All Overwatch Heroes Added In 2026</h2>



<p><strong>Blizzard has added five new Heroes to the rebranded Overwatch in 2026: Anran, Domina, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki.</strong></p>



<p>There were the first new faces of 2026, with a few more to be added throughout the year. They range from expert warriors to…a cat…with a jetpack. More cats, please.</p>
