		<p>Konami, Evil Empire and Motion Twin have announced Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse, an all-new 2D side-scrolling metroidvania that will release this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Castlevania: Belmont‘s Curse Announcement Trailer (ESRB) | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3k9Yy-o6tpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set more than two decades after Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse, Belmont’s Curse is set in 15th century Paris. The whip has been passed on to Trevor Belmont’s successor, who must head out into the city and battle monstrous creatures, heading into a mystical castle and threatens to doom Paris to eternal darkness.</p>
<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of the Castlevania series, and so it’s a massively fan-pleasing announcement to see a new 2D game announced, and then to have such highly regarded developers behind it. Original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/06/dead-cells-review/">Dead Cells</a> studio Motion Twin is here in an advisory role, while their successor studio at Evil Empire are the main developers alongside Konami on Belmont’s Curse. Evil Empire was founded in 2019 to continue to support Dead Cells, but since wrapping up that game’s DLC in 2023, moved on to adapt <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> as a roguelite, which hit its full release last year.</p>
<p>Evil Empire are no strangers to Castlevania, though. The fourth and final expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/13/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review/">Dead Cells was Return to Castlevania</a>, arriving in 2023 with characters, weapons and enemies licensed from the Castlevania series. With a working relationship already established, and that DLC well-received, they’re getting a second crack of the whip at the franchise. What’s interesting is that, where Dead Cells and TRPOP were both rougelites, this is described as a “2D Action-Exploration”, implying a more traditional metroidvania. One to keep an eye on, that’s for sure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Escape From Ever After (Switch) - The Closest We've Yet Come To A Brand-New, Old-School Paper Mario]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/escape-from-ever-after</link>
            <guid>1435177</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p>While we continue to wait for a true RPG sequel to the early <strong>Paper Mario</strong> games, many indie developers have attempted to fill the void, and while nobody has <em>quite</em> managed to recapture their magic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a> feels like the closest anyone has gotten yet. It’s got some quirks, but it does a great job of offering an approachable, funny, and brief take on the lighthearted RPG format many fans crave more of.</p>
<p>It follows the plight of Flynt Buckler, a fairytale hero who arrives at the castle of the dragon he’s destined to defeat in his story, only to discover the beast’s lair has been appropriated by a corporation. Flynt is then politely but firmly recruited into a low-level job in the company, kicking off an adventure in which he travels between various books, fulfilling tasks for his corporate overlords while searching for a way to overthrow them.</p>
<p>It's a cute and clever story driven by surprisingly strong characters and witty, lighthearted writing. Not every joke lands quite as well as intended, but Sleepy Castle Studio is clearly making a game more targeted towards adult audiences and the humour generally hits more than it misses.</p>
<p>Gameplay follows the format established by the more RPG-forward Paper Mario games, wherein you navigate a world that rewards exploration and light platforming prowess. Every party member has their own special field ability and these are often utilised and combined in clever ways for the many puzzles to solve throughout the environment, which feels densely packed with interesting things to do and goodies to find.</p>
<p>Familiar turn-based combat integrates some light timing-based commands for variety. Timely taps or releases of a button can lead to both more damage output and increased defence, which means that success in battle is reliant on both dexterity <em>and</em> raw numbers. As you defeat enemies, you slowly level up the whole party at once, with equippable Trinkets offering you some additional ability to distinguish their stats and abilities further from each other. It's a strong system, though the timing windows can sometimes feel just a <em>bit</em> wonky, leading to some missed inputs that feel unfair.</p>
<p>Aside from the timing windows, the only real complaint I have is that there isn’t quite enough of it. It wraps up after about 20 hours and while that’s decent value for your money, it feels like this game ends just as it’s getting <em>really</em> good.</p>
<p>The visuals do a great job of combining charming 2D characters with simple but effective 3D environments that contrast nicely with their flat forms. Playing on the Switch 2 is especially nice, too, as you can opt for a performance mode that ratchets up to a smooth 60fps with no obvious hit to the resolution.</p>
<p>If you’re at all a fan of the more RPG-focused Mario RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play Escape from Ever After. It may be over a bit too quickly, but the writing, charm, and gameplay mechanics all come together to make for something you won’t want to miss.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/escape-from-ever-after]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's 1996. The weather's crap. You're wandering the streets of a Scottish village that looks deserted aside from some lumbering horrors who seem intent on sticking weird needles into you. No, this isn't the blurb of iconic film Trainspotting, it's the setup for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>.</p>

<p>Revealed during last night's PlayStation State of Play, Townfall's the next quiet knoll entry after last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Glasgow-based developers Screen Burn, makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stories-untold-review">Stories Untold</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/observation-review">Observation</a>, have opted to being the series' signature spooks to Scotland.</p>
<p>A first-person perspective puts you into the shoes of protagonist Simon Ordell, who's returning to a sleepy town on the island of St. Amelia. He's got some past connection to the deserted and fog-veiled place, which is probably to blame for the fact he seems to keep waking up in the water next to its docks. Armed with a pocket television that'll probably illicit plenty of memories if you show it to your dad and a peculiar hospital drip thing in his arm, he wanders about looking for clues.</p>
<p>This being a Silent Hill game, there are semi-human monsters wandering about whom he'll need to deal with via some well-timed stealth or violence. Plus some puzzles to unpuzzle.</p>
<p>Sark about 90s Scotland instilling existential dread, as someone who's had good fun with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> over the past couple of years, I'm well up for more games depicting spooky or mysterious goings on in the northern bit of Sadness Island. My view's certainly skewed by the fact I live here, but assuming Townfall looks like it has potential for some unique spooks, assuming it doesn't go the slightly disappointing route of just being a fairly standard Silent Hill game which happens to be set in the UK.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's due out at some point in 2026 and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1636440/SILENT_HILL_Townfall/">Steam</a> here if you're so inclined.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[High On Life 2: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-the-kotaku-review-2000668283</link>
            <guid>1435168</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>During an extremely tense narrative moment late in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>, I tried to do something silly: I pointed one of my talking alien gun companions at the villain of the story and pulled the trigger. The gun stopped me. I did it again. Once again, the alien gun said no. When I tried once more, my weapon friend stopped me yet again…but warned that, next time, it wouldn’t. If I </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>wanted to interrupt this scripted moment and shoot the bad guy in the face, it would let me do that. And so I pulled that trigger again, and the game reacted, and I laughed. Later, while fighting that same villain in the game’s big final boss fight, I died and got stuck in an infinite death loop when respawning. My only option is to restart from the beginning of the game or hope an upcoming patch fixes my predicament.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This is a perfect encapsulation of my experience with </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>, out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It is a shooter willing to react to the player at all times in creative and funny ways, but also one that is filled with messy bugs, poorly implemented mechanics, and other issues that sometimes derail the hijinks.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>She gets high, she gets high, on life 2&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is a follow-up to 2022’s surprise hit sci-fi comedy shooter </span><i><span>High on Life. </span></i><span>Like that last game, the sequel is a wacky FPS featuring a ton of goofy dialogue, gross-out humor, and oddball references to places like Party City and Spirit Halloween. This time around, however, controversial </span><i><span>Rick &amp; Morty </span></i><span>co-creator Jusitan Roiland isn’t involved, having left the company in 2023. For those worried that his absence would change the game’s vibes or humor, I can report that, for better or for worse, that isn’t the case.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After defeating the evil G3 alien cartel in the last game and stopping them from turning humans into a drug, the nameless bounty hunter you played as during that adventure is now a celebrity. Over the next five years–as seen in a wild montage opening–you party, go on talk shows, and take down tons of other criminals and monsters, all while your sister goes off to join a resistance group that believes humans are still in danger.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That eventually gets her into trouble with a large alien pharma company, and in the process of saving her, you end up a criminal outlaw, join her group, and with the help of some new and old allies, you fight back and try to once again save humanity from aliens hell-bent on turning us into a controlled substance.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Some of those helpful allies are talking alien guns with faces. If you haven’t realized it yet, </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is weird. Yes, the big gimmick in the first game returns in</span><i><span> High on Life 2</span></i><span>. All of the weapons you use are talking characters with their own personalities, desires, and dreams.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This time around, you have some new guns to hang out with, including a married couple dealing with a lot of drama who function as twin handguns that spit out colorful goop together. My favorite new alien gun buddy is a former assassin who, after realizing the error of his ways, lets you cut his head off and shove it into a burst fire assault rifle that can fire spikes. I used him a lot. There are also some returning favorites, like the shotgun lizard alien Gus and the SMG-like Sweezy. The pistol voiced by Roiland, Kenny, doesn’t return, though he is referenced.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Feed your head, then shoot their heads</b></h2> <p><span>Combat in a first-person shooter is indeed different than usual when your rifle or handgun cracks jokes or reacts to things happening in the world. Sometimes I’d switch to a gun not because I thought it would help me in the ongoing firefight, but simply because I was curious how they might react to a situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For example, in one level, I walked under some dripping water and my gun gagged and spat it out. So I spent the next 10 minutes switching between each gun to see how they would react.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Noticeably, the guns seem less chatty than in the first game, but also have more voice lines. So I rarely heard them repeat lines, which was nice and made them less grating to carry around for a dozen hours.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Finally, a game that lets me shoot aliens with a talking gun while skateboarding!”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Squanch Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person semi-open-world sci-fi comedy shooter</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Funny jokes, varied environments, lots of gags to find, alien guns look great</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Lots of bugs, frequent performance issues, so-so combat</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S (Played)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Nearly completed the full game after 15 hours, but the final boss fight broke</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>February 13, 2026 (Launching in April on Switch 2) </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Unfortunately, combat involving these talking guns isn’t much to write home about. I wouldn’t classify the gunplay as bad, but enemies, while varied across the different levels you visit, don’t react much to shots and seem pretty dang stupid. I played on normal difficulty and never died once during combat outside of two deaths during boss fights.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You can buy upgrades for your guns, as before, but they don’t improve the combat. They do help you kill more enemies faster, though, which is nice, as it helps you get through some longer encounters in less time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The other big addition to combat is a skateboard, which you acquire early on. In most areas of the game, as well as most fights, you can skateboard around, grind rails, and hop about like it’s </span><i><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</span></i><span>. The game even directly references Tony Hawk’s games with floating letters you can collect, and it reveals who made all those letters in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Riding the skateboard is a blast as it moves fast and provides more ways to get around arenas during fights. But it can also cause some headaches as the controls are sometimes unresponsive. I frequently bounced off surfaces by accident or was unable to grind something for no apparent reason. Still, it is nice to be able to skate around areas quickly, and shooting guns from a skateboard is indeed cool, so I’m happy it’s here even if it doesn’t always work.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Go ask Alice for a funny joke</b></h2> <p><span>The humor in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is a mix of meta references, absurdist nonsense, slapstick, and satire. I found the game’s ratio for good jokes to be solid. About three out of five jokes landed and made me at least smile or laugh. That’s pretty dang good for a video game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even better, if you just don’t want to talk to some weirdo for three minutes about an elevator or hear people giggling while delivering their lines, you can ignore most of the jokes in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>, which are often hidden out in the worlds you visit. Ignoring all of these gags would likely lead to a less funny experience. Still, if you hate this kind of low-energy, improv-heavy humor, well, skipping a lot of it is an option.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But like </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>’s new skateboard, the comedy is only good when the game works correctly.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000668298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668298"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668298">©Squanch Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Far too many jokes and gags were ruined in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> for different reasons, including dialogue cutting off other dialogue, characters getting stuck in reaction loops, audio disappearing randomly, or some other bug happening and derailing the punchline.</span></p> <p><span>I also ran into bugs and glitches outside of jokes. I got stuck playing </span><i><span>Bible Adventures</span></i><span> (yes, the actual NES game from back in the day) because I couldn’t back out. Another time I got stuck in the floor while trying to play hide-and-seek. Enemies spawned underground, forcing me to abandon a side encounter. One time, I couldn’t even switch my guns, making it impossible to solve one of </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>’s many simple puzzles until I reset.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s a shame that this game is in such a rough state at launch, including numerous performance hiccups on Xbox Series X. There are some really cool and funny ideas in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Shatter your illusions of love</b></h2> <p><span>One memorable mission involves a full-on murder mystery that you must solve, complete with an in-game notepad that lets you mark off clues and suspects. Another time, I visited a retro game planet with low-poly enemies and environments. A standout boss fight involved the baddie digitally inserting themselves into my high-tech bounty suit and clawing their way into my pause menu, forcing me to fight them in the different settings menus.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A favorite mission of mine takes place on a planet dedicated to conventions. Exploring the different cons, including a Murder Con and Human Con, was a treat, especially because I took the time to poke around and interact with everything and everyone I saw.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is a game that is chockablock with creativity and passion. One that rewards you for taking your time and poking at every corner and bit of it. The people who made this game jammed it full of ideas and details, many of which I probably missed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But wacky ideas, good jokes, and weird set pieces aren’t all it takes to make a great FPS. You need satisfying gunplay, consistent movement, and enemies that are engaging to kill.</span><i><span> High on Life 2</span></i><span> doesn’t pull that off. And when it does succeed at something, the odds are high that a bug or performance issue will get in the way or even outright break it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe the ending of </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> will completely change my mind. I’ll have to hope that the game is patched and I can escape my infinite death loop and beat the final boss. If that happens, I’ll return to this review and let you know. For now, I’d suggest people wait to see what’s fixed in the first update before hopping into this wonky but creative sci-fi adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-the-kotaku-review-2000668283]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Competition for customers intensifying."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has written off $200 million of its $776 million acquisition of Angry Birds maker, Rovio, stating the "profitability of [the mobile] business had fallen below the initial forecast" — corporate speak for, 'this hasn't made us as much money as we thought it would.' </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega confirmed back in April 2023 plans to purchase Angry Birds developer Rovio for $776 million, with Rovio's mobile game expertise intended to help boost Sega's own position in the mobile market. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-is-reportedly-close-to-acquiring-angry-birds-developer-rovio-for-1-billion"><u>The acquisition completed in September that same year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in its most recent financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>report</u></a>, Sega Sammy said that while Rovio was "a company with strong development and operational capabilities in the mobile game area, a sector with major growth potential," the "business environment in the global mobile game market [has] rapidly changed, with multiple major titles emerging within a short period, and competition for customer acquisition [is] intensifying." Which is why it's now alerting shareholders of "extraordinarily losses and revision of operating results forecast."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development, and the profitability of this business has fallen below the initial forecast," Sega admitted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the "recoverable amount" related to the buyout fell "significantly" short, the company has written off $198 million (¥30.4 billion), essentially downgrading the value of Rovio to around $578 million — $200m less than it paid for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rovio is just one of the companies Sega owns. It is also home to Company of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment, Two Point Campus developer Two Point Studios, and perhaps most notably, Persona developer Atlus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And on the plus side, Sega's tentpole Sonic series continues to impress. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds"><u>IGN's Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds review</u></a> returned an Amazing 9/10 when it released in September 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A developer who worked on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard"><u>Highguard</u></a> has discussed the "hate" he received after the free-to-play shooter debuted at December's The Game Awards, saying the game, and by extension its team, "turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just two weeks after the free-to-play game's January 26 launch, yesterday <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs"><u>Wildlight let go all but a "core group of developers"</u></a> despite the newly unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-episode-2-is-here-with-a-new-warden-map-ranked-mode-and-more"><u>Episode 2</u></a>, and despite debuting in the top 10 in weekly active users on US Steam, and the top 20 on both US PlayStation and Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a candid <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/article/2022003361059631301" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> posted to X/Twitter, tech artist and rigger Josh Sobel — who was one of those let go — talked about the impact of the launch on himself and the wellbeing of the entire team.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The day leading to The Game Awards 2025 was amongst the most exciting of my life. After 2.5yrs of passionately working on Highguard, we were ready to reveal it to the world. The future seemed bright. Everyone I knew who had any connection to the team or project had the same [positive] sentiments," he wrote, adding that "unbiased" internal pre-reveal feedback was "quite positive," and when it was negative, "it was constructive, and often actionable."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then the trailer came out, and it was all downhill from there," Sobel added. "Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they’ve got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The hate started immediately. In addition to dogpiling on the trailer, I personally came under fire due to my naïveté on Twitter, which almost all of my now-former coworkers had learned to avoid during their previous game launches," he explained. "After setting my Twitter account to private to protect my sanity, many content creators made videos and posts about me and my cowardice, amassing millions of views and inadvertently sending hundreds of angry gamers into my replies. They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be 'woke trash.' All of this was very emotionally taxing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobel acknowledged that there's "much constructive criticism" about Highguard's trailer, marketing, and launch, but also isn't sure if things would've been any better had the game not been announced at The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact," Sobel said. "Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and 'Titanfall 3 died for this.' At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In discussions online about Highguard, [<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Sony's troubled live-service shooter] Concord</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-lays-off-dozens-from-2xkos-development-team-less-than-a-month-after-launch"><u>[Riot's recently launched] 2XKO</u></a>, and such, it is often pointed out by gamers that devs like to blame gamers for their failures, and that that’s silly. As if gamers have no power. But they do. A lot of it. I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a consequence of this, Sobel said many of Highguard's hitherto independent team will "now be forced" to return to the corporate industry "many gamers accused Wildlight of being a part of."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If this pattern continues, all that will be left are corporations, at least in the multiplayer space. Innovation is on life support," he added. "Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this. We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobel finished on wishing the colleagues that remain at Wildlight "the best of luck," and thanked a slew of "incredibly supportive journalists and creators" for their "empathy, intuition, and integrity." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of the best times of my life were spent with [the techart team]," he concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense"><u>high-profile video game developers defended Highguard following the online backlash during the game’s launch</u></a>. Developers from the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian, as well as Fortnite maker Epic, have hit out at the discourse surrounding Highguard, and the internet’s capacity to “hate” on video games at launch. Developers like Cliff Bleszinski of Gears of War fame, Epic executive Mark Rein, and Larian boss Swen Vincke spoke up against, in particular, negativity from critics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a funny old time isn’t it? After last night’s State of Play, it’s got me thinking about how we find out about all of those lovely games we’re going to be playing. It used to be practically once-yearly, the industry taking over LA for E3, and a blast of information that you’d pore over for months afterwards. Now, though, there’s practically an E3-like wealth of knowledge every week thanks to a Nintendo Direct here, a State of Play there, oh, and of course, Geoff’s TGA trailer extravaganza. As gamers, we’ve never been closer to developers and publishers, learning all the intricacies of a game before it even arrives, and in some ways, that’s good, but, as with everything now, there’s something to be said for a good old surprise. Thankfully, we still get those, and Sony pulled that off with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-and-god-of-war-son-of-sparta-out-now/">God of War Son of Sparta</a> last night!</p>

<p>While I’ll be giving that a go later, this week I’ve spent a lot of time hatching eggs. Monster eggs. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-preview-ecology-and-environmentalism-thrive-in-capcoms-latest/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is already doing a lot of things better than its predecessors, and I think Capcom may have another big hit on their hands at this early stage in the year. Besides that, I played Citadelum on the Switch 2 and enjoyed the magic of Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, while getting involved in Dosas Divas and Earth Must Die too.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> was the first to show her face, but she did so in the kitchen, brandishing a wrench, which was a bit disconcerting. That’s because she’s been reviewing Clue: Murder By Death, which you’ll see a review about shortly. She also cheated the Wolf Spirit bosses in Spirit of the North 2, “by sitting my fox on a wall where the attacks couldn’t hit me. I stayed there all the way through while the wolves huffed and puffed and I occasionally popped down to get a hit in when they got tired. I probably wasn’t supposed to do it that way but it was much less stressful!”</p>
<p>It was the reviews train for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/romeo-is-a-dead-man-review/">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> and the new Styx stealth ’em up, adding Halls of Torment to the mix. Coming down from the high of reviewing and playing Nioh 3, <strong>Jason</strong> put time into Hordes of Hunger, “which is fine”, and a lot more into Heretical, “which is amazing”. He also made a start on Mewgenics, the new game from the maker of Binding of Isaac, but he’s not sold on either its humour or playstyle.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> gaming this week was all about the gruesome platforming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/reanimal-review/">Reanimal</a>, which he was filled with praise for in his review.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> returned to the 2010s with Red Dead Redemption’s remaster. “I originally played it at launch back in 2010 and it’s fair to say that I didn’t have as much of an appreciation for the story and setting that I do now that I’m (slightly) more mature. Given its age, I was also worried that it would feel a little too dated, especially given how busy open world games are nowadays. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at just how much I’m enjoying it. Turning off the auto-aim has certainly helped to make the gunplay more engaging, something that has always felt lacking in Rockstar’s games.”</p>
<p>He’s wrapped up Star Wars Outlaws this week, so <strong>Aran</strong> will be trying to convince you it’s a cosy game in a blog this weekend. He’s since moved on to The Expanse Telltale Series, “which is decent but suffers as a prequel, as none of the events are mentioned again in the show that I can remember.” So he’s also started&nbsp;Like A Dragon Gaiden The Man Who Erased His Name, and is enjoying getting back into the Yakuza world.</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> played Arknight Endfield, which sounds to me like a shonky Batman game knock off, but he’s impressed by it: “A lot of new gacha games feel like they’re just vehicles to get you to spend money, but this one really takes its time just letting you play an interesting game for the sake of playing it. Soooo much Death Stranding style and vibes and even gameplay mechanics in it, too. I’m a fan!”</p>
<p>Having bounced around various genres with Mario Tennis Fever, Under the Island, The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest, and Crisol: Theatre of Idols, <strong>Steve</strong> has embraced the 90s nostalgia of &nbsp;Lost Records: Bloom and Rage, and is passing an eye across Steam Next Fest demos while waiting for Resident Evil Requiem.</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> been getting into High on Life 2, which has much the same tone as the original game, but has evolved its bizarre riffing on the first person shooter genre.</p>

			<p>USA-based independent developer <strong>ProbablyMonsters</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we recently interviewed</a> about the launch of <strong>Storm Lancers</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) was featured <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the State of Play broadcast</a> with an interesting new game called <strong>Crimson Moon</strong>. It's an action/adventure roleplaying game with optional co-op with another player. The setting is "<strong>Gothic High Renaissance</strong>"; the protagonist is a half-human, half-angel <strong>Nephilim</strong> born of a forbidden union and sworn to protect humanity as a <strong>Knight of the Crimson Moon</strong>.</p>



<p>The game takes place in <strong>Gildenarch</strong>, a once grand metropolis <strong>now overrun by the Infernal Legion</strong> and a corruption known as "<strong>Hellgrowth</strong>". As players reclaim the city district by district, they will uncover the secrets behind the titular Order of the Crimson Moon and the city's fall. The narrative culminates in a high-stakes confrontation with <strong>Solomon Moore</strong>, a sinister vampire lord who engineered Gildenarch's demise.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is built around <strong>intense, replayable missions</strong> rather than a continuous open world. Players embark on <strong>15 to 45-minute "runs" into the demon-infested street</strong>s, where dynamic maps and evolving enemy compositions ensure that no two incursions feel the same. Combat is described as <strong>fast, visceral, and "Souls-inspired,"</strong> emphasizing mastery and skill expression with parries and finishers. As a Nephilim, <strong>players can wield divine abilities and unleash explosive celestial transformations</strong> to instantly reshape the battlefield.</p>



<p>Between missions, players will return to the <strong>Sanctus Clypeus</strong> (the Church's headquarters), a living hub where they can upgrade persistent stats, craft gear at the Blacksmith, and interact with various non-playable characters (NPCs) before planning their next move at the War Table.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, Crimson Moon <strong>features optional co-op</strong> that is designed to amplify the game's intensity. Cooperative play <strong>unlocks unique synergies,</strong> allowing players to combine abilities for devastating attacks and revive one another when overwhelmed by the Hellgrowth. The game utilizes <strong>dynamic difficulty scaling</strong> to keep the challenge high regardless of the group size.</p>

            <p>The Project Windless team isn't using gen-AI for "content creation or narrative elements", Krafton has confirmed.</p>
<p>Last night, Krafton announced Project Windless, an open-world PlayStation 5 game based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as The Bird That Drinks Tears.</p>
<p>Soon after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">trailer debuted at last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, many began to wonder if generative AI had been used during development. So, I decided to go to the source and find out, and while the Project Windless team has used AI "internally during exploratory phases" for efficiency's sake, it is not "a central, player-facing feature" of the upcoming game.</p>
<p>"Krafton's studios operate with a high degree of creative independence, enabling each team to select the tools and methods that best suit their projects," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>"For Project Windless, the Montreal team is taking a traditional, craftsmanship-driven approach to single-player development. The team primarily uses AI internally during exploratory phases to support iteration and efficiency rather than as a central, player-facing feature of the game. </p>
<p>"Project Windless uses traditional game AI systems to drive NPC behaviour and bring the world and its characters to life beyond combat. These systems govern how characters react, move, and behave in the environment. We are not using generative AI for content creation or narrative elements."</p>
<p>So, there you have it. </p>

<p>You of course don't need me to tell you how much of a hot topic AI is these days, and many studios have said they use the technology during development. Most prominently in recent months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian came under fire when founder Swen Vincke suggested the Divinity team was using gen-AI to develop concept art</a>.</p>
<p>Following backlash to this statement, Vincke said "to ensure there is no room for doubt", Larian had decided to "refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development" for its upcoming game.</p>
<p>"That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Vincke said in January</a>.</p>

		<p>Sony and Arc System Works have announced that the release date for their upcoming fighting game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> will launch on 6th August 2026 for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Oh, they also revealed some more characters, too…</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls - Unbreakable X-Men Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4C_0Yf43fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the Unbreakable X-Men will feature in Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls. This team of mutant heroes has been assembled with Storm as their leader, and the endlessly popular Wolverine. Joining them is the young mutant Magik, who can use both magic and her Soulsword, and the now autonomous AI of the Danger Room, Danger.</p>
<p>The X-Men’s appearance will tie into a new narrative mode that Arc System Works is creating in collaboration with Marvel Games. They’ve adapted the narrative, world and characters specifically for this game, blending together the comics and manga, and collaborating with an as-yet-unnamed writer to do so.</p>

<p>The story will be presented as motion comics, featuring full voice acting across&nbsp;English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Latin American Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest surprises of <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a> was undoubtedly the announcement of <strong>Project Windless</strong>. An open world action RPG in development at <strong>KRAFTON Montréal</strong>, it is based on the "<strong>The Bird That Drinks Tears</strong>" fantasy universe created by the Korean novelist <strong>Lee Youngdo</strong>, which has been described as "<strong>The Korean Lord of the Rings</strong>".  <strong>Patrik Méthé</strong>, Head of KRAFTON Montréal Studio and Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world. For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.</em></p>



<p>Project Windless is technically <strong>a prequel set 1,500 years before the events narrated in Youngdo's books</strong>, a common choice for game developers whenever they want to draw from lore while maintaining complete creative freedom. The story will focus on the origins of the "<strong>Hero King</strong>," the legendary founder of the <strong>Aragit Kingdom</strong>. The setting features four unique races:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Tokabi:</strong> Tricksters who wield fire and magic, known for laughing in the face of death.</li>



<li><strong>The Humans:</strong> Ambitious and strategic, constantly vying to shift the balance of power.</li>



<li><strong>The Naga:</strong> A cold-blooded and brilliant reptilian race, driven by a ruthless desire for domination.</li>



<li><strong>The Rekkon:</strong> The bird-like playable race. Fierce, nomadic warriors of immense size and speed, driven by a singular "life wish."</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6NK4164iY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the first developer diary</a>, KRAFTON Montréal, which is working alongside KRAFTON teams based in teams in Pangyo, South Korea, to ensure authenticity, <strong>the combat was described as brutal, visceral, and overwhelming</strong>. In the lore, Rekkon warriors have immense strength, so <strong>players will often face dozens or even hundreds of enemies simultaneously</strong>. To achieve this scale, the team behind Project Windless is using a new "<strong>Mass Entity AI</strong>" technology. This system allows for the simulation of hundreds or thousands of smart, reactive characters. The goal is to transform standard encounters into unpredictable, large-scale conflicts that simulate the feel of a world truly torn by war.</p>



<p>Project Windless is being developed as a <strong>premium single player experience for PC and consoles</strong>. There's no release window in sight.</p>

            <p>A goose with your skillset must be able to honk freely, unconstricted. They must be versatile, capable, adaptable. They must be grounded, stable, constant. I believe you are ready, goose. Honk.</p>
<p>That isn't quite what Keanu Reeves' talkative tailor says in the reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> devs Saber's Untitled John Wick Game, but it's what I heard.

<p>My argument for doing so isn't exactly nuanced. Both games currently bear similarly formatted monikers and John Wick's got a lot in common with the Goose Game's anarchistic avian. Think about it. John Wick just wants to live a normal life, until he's provoked into unleashing his dark talents on a bunch of people whose days are thoroughly ruined as a result. The goose just wants to live a normal life, until it's provoked by the fact the villagers exist into unleashing its dark talents on a bunch of people whose days are thoroughly ruined as a result.</p><p>John Wick is nicknamed the Baba Yaga, a witch in Slavic folklore who either fries and eats children or helps out the hero of a tale. A golden egg-laying goose is the subject of one of Aesop's Fables. Let's face it, geese would also probably fry and eat human children if given the necessary opposable thumbs and cooking apparatus.</p>
<p>So, ignore the fact Saber have already made clear in this <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/john-wick-game-announced-for-ps5/">PlayStation blog post</a> that they've yet to reveal the Wick game's proper title, with a release date also still to come. This is an Untitled Goose Game spinoff and I won't hear otherwise.</p>
<p>As for what we do know of this game that'll loosely follow in the footsteps of delisted previous John Wick game adaptation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-wick-hex-review">John Wick Hex</a>, Saber say they've worked "closely" with Reeves, Wick director Chad Stahelski and Lionsgate on it. The latter have had a hand in shaping the game's story, which Saber write "addresses a significant time in John Wick’s life, featuring well-known and iconic characters, as well as compelling new characters specifically created for this production". Judging from their <a href="https://x.com/SaberGames/status/2022082792046129464">Twitterings</a>, it looks to be winding back the clock for a bit of stubbled killer origin storying.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all that's been made clear is that this Wick game's very much keen on being as close to a playable action film as it can, with Saber's PR speak describing it as "something that blurs the line between movies and video games, making it something truly special".</p>
<p>Untitled John Wick Game's release dateless for now, but the studio have at least confirmed it'll be coming to PC at some point between now and whenever the apocalypse signals that humanity's goose is cooked.</p>

<p>A new claim reveals that another title is in the works at Santa Monica Studios, alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, which could be Cory Barlog’s game. </p>



<p>There were many God of War titles rumoured to be in development, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer title</a> and one set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Out of all the rumoured ones, the Trilogy Remake and Sons of Sparta got confirmed yesterday. However, there is one more title players have been curious about: Cory Barlog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-studios-next-game-is-progressing-well-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game</a>, for which we seem to have new details. </p>

<p>During a new discussion on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151278571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, shinobi602 replied ‘naw’ when asked “Please&nbsp;shinobi602&nbsp;tell us that the GoW remake is not the Cory Barlog project? The insider then added that the game is “Not that far (barring any delays of course).” He also added that the reveal of this project is expected to be this year, and “given the quarter they’re targeting,” it is likely the reveal could be at the May State of Play or Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but Shinobi doesn’t know that for sure yet. </p>



<p>Shinobi added that if the reveal doesn’t come by then Santa Monica may have either pushed the game’s release, or kept a “shorter reveal to release” window. That’s all we know about the other Santa Monica game at the moment; however, readers should take this information with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Santa Monica had some huge reveals planned for yesterday’s State of Play event, giving it a picture-perfect finale. They not only confirmed that a God of War Trilogy Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was in development</a>, but also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> the 2D God of War title for players to try out now. </p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A former Wildlight developer has shared their thoughts on Highguard's release after its announcement at The Game Awards last year, stating due to "false assumptions" around its debut trailer, "we were turned into a joke".</p>
<p>Highguard closed out The Game Awards 2025, with a trailer introducing us all to a world of battling Wardens and their magical mounts. The game then launched in January, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">quickly had a large influx of players on its release</a>. However, there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this effort to regain favour, though, yesterday it was announced that multiple Wildlight developers had been laid off, only a matter of weeks since Highguard made its free-to-play debut. But according to Highguard's former lead technical artist Josh Sobel, the team was doomed from its announcement, and it was "all downhill" after the game's reveal at the The Game Awards.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2022003361059631301">lengthy post on social media</a>, Sobel said internal feedback on Highguard prior to its reveal "was quite positive", and the team felt confident it had a hit on its hands. Where feedback was negative, Sobel said, "it was constructive, and often actionable". He added those "who played the game, including us, had a blast. And since we were an independent, self-published studio built with royalties in mind, many of us were hoping this could finally be the thing that broke the millennial financial curse".</p><p>But that positivity left after its The Game Awards trailer. "Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they've got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not," Sobel said. "The hate started immediately."</p>
<p>Sobel soon locked his X profile after Highguard's trailer, stating videos were then made about his "cowardice", with people laughing at him for "being proud" of Highguard. "All of this was very emotionally taxing," he said.</p>
<p>"There is much constructive criticism that can be and has been said about Highguard's trailer, marketing, and launch, but I don’t think it’s my place to commentate on that. I also don't think there’s any way to know whether the launch would have fared better or worse without the massive spotlight that was thrown onto us in response to The Game Awards' trailer placement. But we never got that chance," Sobel continued.</p>

</figure>
<p>"We were turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact. Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3 died for this'. At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial."</p><p>Sobel remarked that in online discussions about games like Highguard, Concord and 2XKO, people tend to say developers blame their failures on the gamers. However, Sobel says that is a "silly" notion, as gamers still have the power to inform discourse.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role," Sobel said. "All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked."</p>
<p>There is no denying the sting and hurt in Sobel words, but while he may sound bitter about how things have ultimately panned out, it is undeniably a shame to see a game stumble out of the starting gate. To be clear, Highguard itself has not been shut down, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">with a "core group" of developers still working on it</a>. For how much longer, who can say. But whatever the end result, it is never nice to see a game 'fail', and hear about layoffs across the industry.</p>

<p>As for Sobel, he said that "even though this adventure has come to an abrupt and emotionally challenging close" for him, he doesn't "regret one second of it".</p>
<p>Following its rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry also voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating:</p>
<p>"No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Yesterday was a big day for new video game trailers, courtesy of the Sony State of Play. But a little earlier, away from the limelight, came another lengthy showcase of an especially cool looking game you might have missed.</p>
<p>Screamer, the story-driven arcade racing game, released its career walkthrough gameplay trailer, showcasing roughly 34 minutes of cinematics, racing, and early narrative. This game has JRPG-inspired storytelling, and an opening intro cutscene paired with music from Jpop group WAGAMAMARAKIA. It's just a tease of the full game, but even so it shows some promise I reckon.</p>
<p>This trailer also highlights a variety of different racing teams, all entering the Screamer tournament. With a billion dollars on the line, drift-heavy futuristic racing lies at the heart of this underdog release. You can check out the full trailer yourself below if you fancy.</p>

<p>First revealed in 2024 and recently popping up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">at The Game Awards </a>too, Screamer is a reboot of an old MS-DOS game from all the way back in 1995. This new iteration comes from the same hands at Milestone, albeit with a healthy amount of experience since then. If that developer sounds familiar, it's the same company behind games like MotoGP 25 and Hot Wheels Unleashed: Supercharged.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to launch this year, on the 26th March on PC and consoles. If you're a racing fan, or love a bit of genre-blending in your games, maybe it's one worth keeping an eye on?</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/beast-of-reincarnation/">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, the upcoming action role-playing game created by Pokémon series developers Game Freak, has been given a release date of August 4th 2026.</p>
<p>Set in the post-apocalyptic ruins of Japan in the year 4026, the game follows Emma the Sealer and her dog Koo as they battle to restore their homeland from a blight that has ravaged the land.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beast of Reincarnation - Release Date Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqxdVtJ24ms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There are different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo lead in to strike first.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S and will also be available on Xbox Game Pass from day one.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-gets-debut-gameplay-first-person-game-set-in-scotland/</link>
            <guid>1435072</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a>, <strong>KONAMI</strong> and <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong> have unveiled the first gameplay trailer for <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>. The spin-off psychological horror game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced back in 2022</a></strong>, and this is the first time we learn anything concrete about it. Meanwhile, the development team, originally known as <strong>No Code</strong> (the same ones behind <strong>Stories Untold</strong> and <strong>Observation</strong>), has rebranded to <strong>Screen Burn</strong>.</p>



<p>More information was revealed in the subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, where the game was described as a full-length, self-contained adventure <strong>set in cold Scotland</strong> and <span><strong>played entirely in first-person</strong>, marking</span> a significant shift from the series' usual third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Writer and director <strong>Jon McKellan</strong> said:</p>



<p><em>Our main objectives were to make a game that could feel specific to the team who made it, to bring something new to the series in terms of setting and to really think about what Silent Hill, both in concept and gameplay, could look like through a Screen Burn lens.</em></p>



<p>According to Screen Burn, <strong>the first-person perspective fundamentally reshapes how players experience Silent Hill's horror</strong>. Lead Game Designer <strong>Graeme McKellan</strong> emphasized that the limited field of view creates tension through what happens off-screen, noting that <strong>what happens off-screen is sometimes even scarier than what happens right in front of the player</strong>.</p>



<p>Combat offers familiar tools to players, such as planks of wood, pipes, and firearms, but also introduces meaningful choices between confrontation and evasion. <strong>A peeking gameplay mechanic allows the protagonist, Simon Ordell, to lean carefully around corners and over walls</strong>, assessing threats before committing to action. </p>



<p>Screen Burn's signature analog technology aesthetic manifests in the CRTV, <strong>a handheld pocket television that reimagines Silent Hill's iconic radio</strong>. Players physically bring up the device and manually tune through frequencies to discover narrative content and detect enemy positions. Graeme McKellan added:</p>



<p><em>We really wanted the player to bring it up and actually use it. The analog tech, that's kind of been my visual calling card. Most of the things we've done, even in our previous games, has been as close to real-life technology as we can get.</em></p>



<p>The developers have described the main character of Silent Hill: Townfall as a <strong>layered, uncertain, and deeply human being</strong> who returns to the island town of St. Amelia after receiving a mysterious phone call asking him to come to the island and put things to rest.</p>



<p>Jon McKellan confirmed <strong>guilt serves as a central theme</strong>, explored through different manifestations: </p>



<p><em>Guilt is a strong theme throughout Silent Hill's many stories, and I wanted to dive deeper into the various different ways that guilt can manifest. Where it comes from, what it can do to people, and how, if you can, come to accept or resolve it. </em></p>



<p>The narrative <strong>maintains Screen Burn's signature mystery-driven storytelling</strong>, with players gradually uncovering both small details and major reveals as they meet other characters whose connections to Simon prove crucial. Some mysteries resolve as the game progresses, while others will only deepen, <strong>inviting players to explore every corner of the town</strong>. </p>



<p>The inspiration for St. Amelia <strong>draws heavily from real locations along Scotland's east coast, particularly fishing villages like St Monans</strong>. The development team conducted extensive location scouting, capturing not just visuals but the atmosphere, smell, wind, and sound of these coastal settlements.</p>



<p>A key inspiration came from the so-called <strong>Haar</strong>, a dense fog that rolls in along Scotland's east coast. Jon McKellan recalled an early research trip where the fog became so thick that he and his brother lost sight of the coast and couldn't determine which direction it was. The fog is, of course, a fundamental element of mystery in the whole series, so <strong>it was a perfect fit for Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>, too.</p>



<p>Screen Burn <strong>only employs around 30 developers</strong>, but this is still going to be a full-length game, and publisher Annapurna Interactive said <strong>it's going to be one of the biggest games they've published yet</strong>.</p>

<p>Launching next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The lovely, heartfelt 2D adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neva">Neva</a> is getting a paid DLC expansion, and it'll cost you less than the vast majority of Starbucks' menu.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>19th February</strong>, <strong>Neva: Prologue</strong> will set you back a mere <strong>£2.49</strong> in the UK and will reveal how the game's key protagonists, Alba and Neva, first became involved with one another.</p>
<p>The expansion will introduce three new locations along with some unique game mechanics, and developer Nomada Studio has stressed that it's intended to be played <em>after</em> the main game. It looks pretty cool though, with the trailer showcasing some creatures that look awfully similar to No-Face from <strong>Spirited Away</strong>. Hey, not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow Alba as she chases a trail of white butterflies deep into the corrupted swamps, only to discover a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Determined to save her, Alba must earn the young wolf's trust and guide her through the blighted wilderness. Together, they will face new enemies, endure perilous trials, and confront a monstrous force that threatens to tear them apart.</p>
<p>Designed to be experienced after completing the main game, Neva: Prologue offers a deeper challenge and rich narrative for returning players. The expansion introduces three new locations, each featuring unique gameplay mechanics, alongside new challenges, enemies, and intense boss encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, if you've yet to experience the main game, we called Neva "a spectacular example of art in motion, delivering a thoroughly engrossing platforming experience that’ll stick in your mind long after you’ve rolled credits" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/neva">9/10 review</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, we think it's well worth checking out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokopia Hands-On Preview: Pokémon Has Another Mega Hit On Its Hands]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>1435045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokopia is less than a month away from a big release, and after a hands-on experience at Pokémon EUIC, it’s fair to say my excitement levels are reaching unprecedented levels.</p>



<p>First revealed in September’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Presents, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is the latest spin-off game in the franchise’s 30-year history, and, while not every game under the Pokémon banner has been a hit over the years, Pokopia is showing every sign of being a huge phenomenon in the same fashion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> was.</p>







<h2 id="h-pokopia-will-attract-players-new-and-old">Pokopia Will Attract Players New And Old</h2>

<figure><figcaption>New adventures. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>During a short demo at Pokémon EUIC, one major standout from the experience was that Pokopia is going to appeal to the masses, thrilling long-term Pokémon fans who want a new way to play with their favourite characters, as well as opening doors to those who don’t have much experience with the franchise.</p>



<p>Even from the short session, it was clear there are various levels of depth with Pokopia. Those who want a simple experience hanging out with their favourite Pokémon will get exactly that, while those seeking deeper content and a more extensive list of tasks are also suited. Flicking through the menus, I was delighted to find a huge page of collectables, including fossils and relics from the human world.</p>



<p>The process of attracting new Pokémon to join you is simple. Like the classic Viva Piñata games, each Pokémon has environmental requirements, ranging from shaded grass beneath a tree to a bench next to a punching bag. Some Pokémon are harder to attract than others, with more complex requirements or a specific time of day needed, and, once they’re a part of your new home, you’ll need to make further adjustments by crafting items or making more environmental changes to increase a Pokémon’s comfort levels.</p>



<p>Again, this appeals to all players. Those who just want to hang out with Pokémon can do that and not worry too much about comfort levels, while completionists will be constantly pushing to ensure everyone is happy.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-come-to-life-in-a-new-way">Pokémon Come to Life in a New Way</h2>



<p>Another standout from the demo was how the Pokémon come to life in entirely new ways, each having its own personality, likes, and dislikes. You can give Pokémon gifts to raise their friendship level, and speaking to the Pokémon I found across the area instantly sparked memories of discovering my favourite, and least-favourite, residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing/" id="3053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing</a>.</p>



<p>The Pokémon will also interact with each other, and I couldn’t help but laugh when Bulbasaur told me that Geodude smells nice. These types of interactions with Pokémon were one of the reasons why the Mystery Dungeon games were so good, and bringing them to life on Switch 2 in this way opens the door to countless more memories being created.</p>



<p>All in all, I can’t wait to get my hands on Pokopia again, and I can already tell I’m going to sink countless hours unlocking everything and perfecting my Pokémon home.</p>

            <p>Last night, we got a flurry of PlayStation-flavoured announcements thanks to the most recent State of Play. From the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">gun-fu of Jon Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">the hench chicken man in Project Windless</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">the serene colour palette of Neva: Prologue</a>, it was a pretty stacked show.</p>
<p>But, something you may have missed, is that when the next title from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a> developer House House makes its debut later this year, it will be available on PS Plus (the Essential tier) from day one. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Big Walk, as the studio's upcoming game is called, is a cooperative multiplayer adventure all about teamwork and talking.</p>
<p>"Set out with your friends through a wide-open world full of challenges, puzzles, and discoveries. You'll need to work together to find your way around, stay in contact using an assortment of tools and toys, and figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless," reads the official blurb.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Away from these adventures, there will still be time "to just hang out" with your friends. Hanging out can include watching the sunset, or if that sounds too serene, you could instead "steal your friend's binoculars and kick them into the ocean". I mean, sure, why not. In the words of House House, "spending time with friends is the best part of a big walk".</p>
<p>You can check out Big Walk's PS5 trailer below. On its release later this year (exact date TBC), Big Walk will also be coming to PC.</p>

		<p>Nomada Studio and Devolver Digital have announced Neva: Prologue, a DLC expansion for the gorgeous side-scrolling adventure that will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Switch and PC on 19th February. Oh, and it’s just £2.49.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva: Prologue | Coming February 19" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SELjelhDqDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you wondered just how it was that Alba met her wolf companion Neva in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/neva-review/">the 2024 game</a>, then Neva: Prologue is set to answer that. It will start as Alba follows white butterflies into a corrupted swamp, only to find a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Alba will have to earn the wolf’s trust, fight new enemies together and overcome monsters that are stalking them.</p>
<p>While it is a prequel story, it’s designed to be played after completing the main game. It will come with three new locations, each with new gameplay mechanics, new challenges, enemies and boss encounters. Completionists will also have five hidden challenge flowers to seek out.</p>

<p>Revealed during last night's PlayStation State of Play, Belmont's Curse has already been confirmed to be on its way to PC when it releases at some point in 2026. Konami, Evil Empire, and Motion Twin - the latter two being the Dead Cells devs - sum its premise up as follows:</p>
<blockquote>1499. Paris is engulfed as monstrous creatures suddenly emerge from the shadows. Armed with the legendary holy whip, the Vampire Killer, Trevor Belmont’s successor ventures into the burning streets and the looming castle to hunt down the beasts. Will she succeed in saving Paris from devastation…?</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, speculation's rife that this mysterious protagonist is Belmont and mage Sypha Belnades' daughter. Regardless, she'll be using the whip, a sword, and more weapons to be revealed down the line as she slices through colourfully-rendered gothic chambers, battling foes and searching for hidden secrets.</p><p>Konami have been quick to put their tease trousers on and declare in <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">a post</a> on Castlevania's 40th anniversary website that Belmont's Curse is just the first step in a wider revival of the classic series. "This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, 'Castlevania' will be revived," the publishers declared. "This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania. Look forward to the return of the magnificent 'nightmare' lurking in the darkness."</p>
<p>If you're in need of convincing why Evil Empire and Motion Twin are great candidates for Konami to have gotten involved in this big vamprevival, at least in theory, here's an excerpt from Brendy's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-review">Dead Cells review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In short, every little fracas is a trial of quickness, luck and body memory, and it feels superb. I could talk more about the daily challenge mode, or the new "malaise" that infects you when certain enemies strike, or whether or not the game counts as a “true metroidvania” (this is an argument that boils the collective piss of team RPS and will never be resolved). But I’m happier to just recommend it on the strength of its movement alone. Blisteringly fast when it needs to be, challenging without being frustrating, and packed with sharp, fatal toys, Dead Cells doesn’t keep you on your toes, it keeps you on your toenails.</blockquote>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can wishlist Castlevania: Belmont's Curse on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4231820/Castlevania_Belmonts_Curse/">Steam</a> right now.</p>
