So far, there are <em>twelve</em>, and it’s absolutely bewildering.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,195752" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Free-to-play games having multiple currencies is, again, nothing new, and it’s all by design, all a part of the psychological systems to have you desperate to top things up, keep things ticking, and if you can <em>just</em> get three more of these, then a whole other thing unlocks! And, again, the big issue here is that this is <em>Pokémon</em> doing it to an audience with a huge proportion of children, and indeed delivering it in the most byzantine way imaginable.</p><p>To discover just how bonkers this all is, on the game’s main page, there’s a button on the bottom-right with three lines. Tap that, and there’s an option below “Shop” called “Items.” Click on this innocuous little word, and the lunacy is revealed.</p><p>Let’s lay it all out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Poké gold (non-paid)</li><li>Poké gold (paid)</li><li>Shinedust</li><li>Shop ticket</li><li>Special shop ticket</li><li>Premium ticket</li><li>Pack Hourglass</li><li>Wonder Hourglass</li><li>Event Hourglass</li><li>Advance Ticket</li><li>Event Shop Ticket (Meowth)</li><li>Emblem Ticket (Genetic Apex)</li><li>Rewind Watch</li></ul><p>Now, we’re being generous here, including the two types of gold as one to get to that total of 12. And if your list doesn’t have that many, that’s because you currently don’t own any of them. It’s a list that just keeps expanding, and given the specificity of the Event Shop Ticket and Emblem Ticket, we must assume that there are other types of these to come.</p><p>You might expect me here to go through explaining what each type does, but you know what? Not even The Pokémon Company seems willing to share that. That Advance Ticket’s entry reads, “This ticket cannot be used yet. Wait and see what it’s for!”</p><p>Um, no? Just tell me? It’s already annoying enough as it is.</p><figure id="" data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of these currencies are used to buy items from specific pages of the game’s shop, which itself is laid out as if it got caught in one of those Doctor Strange spells where all the buildings and train tracks start spinning and weaving inside one another. To spend the Event Shop Ticket (Meowth), you need to go to the “Limited Time / Events” section of the shop, and then to the Event page within that, as distinct from the Premium page, Poké gold page, and the mysterious and always-empty “Other.” There’s another Other in the “Main” section of the shop, which is also empty! Is it empty of the same things? No one knows!</p><p>Special Shop Tickets are gained when you sacrifice multiple versions of full-art or better cards, which the game never explains at any point, and require you to have somehow gathered three or more of the same incredibly rare art. We’re talking about cards with a 0.3 percent (or worse, getting as low as 0.013 percent) chance of coming out of a pack here. You get <em>one</em> of those per card (I know, because infuriatingly I’ve somehow pulled three of the gorgeous Snorlax full-art card), and the cheapest item in this shop costs <em>seven</em> Special Shop Tickets. That’s for the presentation backgrounds, rather than the fancy black-and-silver sleeves, playmat or coin you might want—they cost 12 tickets each!</p><p>Oh wait! Hang on! It <em>is</em> thirteen currencies, because I completely forgot to include Pack Points! Yeah, there’s yet another system that it doesn’t even bother to remember when listing what you own. These are the points you can use to exchange for cards you might want in your deck, gained by opening packs, and only appearing—not when you’re building packs or on any of the card screens—but when you’re on the page to select a new sealed pack to open...</p><p>WHO LET ANY OF THIS HAPPEN?!</p><p>I have to stop writing now, in case I discover a fourteenth currency I’d not seen before now and have an aneurysm.</p><p>And why is it like this? To deliberately confuse you. To make sure you’re never certain which currency is one you should be holding onto and which is one that has no other purpose than to be spent there and then. And to constantly dangle numbers in front of you that could get higher if only you bought just a teensy bit of gold. Some directly, like hourglasses, where shortages can be made up by subbing in gold you own; others indirectly by only arriving if you buy the (abysmal) Premium Pass, or won by continuing playing that Event where you just ran out of hourglasses...</p><p>Next time, the <em>eight</em> different pages of Missions!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That film, which I love, tells the story of a blue, pudgy alien criminal who crashes in Hawaii and befriends a little girl as he pretends to be her puppy to avoid being captured by authorities. As with all of Disney’s popular animated movies these days, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is getting remade as a live-action film. And our first real look at the character has me nervous. </p><p>On November 8, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Disney Twitter account posted</a></span> an image of Stitch as he will appear in the May 2025 live-action adaptation of the animated movie.

My first complaint is simple: He’s not blue enough! </p><p>My second complaint is that Stitch doesn’t look pudgy and round enough. One of the best parts of<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is how characters in the movie have this round and oblong appearance<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">. It was very different from the usual house style</a></span> seen in most Disney animated flicks back in the day, and as a kid, I adored that visual. Stitch was cute and very funny, too, which also helped me fall in love with the film.</p><p>This new Stitch is giving me live-action Sonic vibes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">but before he was fixed and made less ugly and horrible looking.</a></span> That’s not a good thing! </p><p>Now, let me just say that I’m not angry about Stitch’s new look. I’m not going to send threatening messages to people who worked on the film or start some online campaign to harass people or create videos complaining that Disney is “ruining” Stitch. </p><p>At the end of the day, this is a movie designed for kids. It ain’t for me. And if I really, really don’t like the new Stich, I can just watch the OG film and not worry about the remake. See, this is how adults handle this kind of stuff. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395">You don’t need to get angry or toxic</a></span>. Just point out that something is either not for you or objectively bad and move on. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> arrives in theaters on May 23, 2025. I hope he looks more blue in the actual movie. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its Q2 2024 financial report, revealing that the PlayStation 5 had reached 65.5 million units and the quarter had performed well enough to warrant an upgrade to the full-year forecast for the gaming segment.</p>
<p>Following the report, the usual investors call saw PlayStation Co-CEO Hiroki Totoki talking about a couple of hot topics. Speaking of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure of Concord</a>, which led to wasting over $200 million spent on the project and to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure</a> of the developer Firewalk Studios last week, he said (excerpt <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/sony-leads-say-the-company-gained-a-lot-of-experience-from-concords-failure-and-will-have-to-do-more-user-testing-or-internal-evaluation-in-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GamesRadar</a>):</p>
<p><em>Currently, we are still in the process of learning. Basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it. So for us, for our reflection, we probably need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates. And then we need to bring them forward, and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did. Also, we have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development, and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother.</em></p>
<p>Totoki also <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/sony-boss-admits-forcing-pc-gamers-into-playstation-accounts-can-invite-pushback-but-insists-they-have-to-keep-games-safe-which-doesnt-really-track-in-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked </a>about the pushback of PC gamers on Sony's hard requirement to create a PlayStation Network account in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarök</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. The executive admitted that users haven't liked the policy, but he stressed the need to ensure safety in live service games through the PSN account requirement:</p>
<p><em>We have learned a lot. The way to face the issues regarding PC, for instance. The PlayStation accounts that we have offered – well actually, by offering them, for instance, sometimes that tends to invite pushback. But for the live service games, in order to maintain order of the gaming so that anybody can enjoy the games safely, we need to create an environment conducive to that and, of course, enjoying the game freely. </em><em>Having some restrictions, may not call it rule, but to ask the users and gamers to follow the manner, those manners are very important and we have to continue to seek the best way to achieve this.</em></p>
<p>The thing is, neither of those two games are live service titles. They're single player games, and PC gamers rightfully do not understand why they'd have to create a PSN account to play titles that do not even have any online functionality.</p>

It's got hexagonal maps, flesh trees, gangly Evangelion-grade giants, "otherworldly hymns of decay", nuclear bombs, and a player-led "blend of magic and cyberpunk" that extends from the city architecture to the research component. All of which is my cup of giblets. Here's the launch trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>OK, as and when I play, I'm probably going to turn off that unit dialogue. Why does everybody sound so chipper about being forced to trade blows with tentacle beasts? But the putrid scenery is inviting, and I like the sound of a "combat-focused" 4X with battles taking place on the same map as exploration and construction. I also like the premise of, essentially, deciding what particular flavour of sci-fantasy you want your civ to become. Will you field a robot army dolled up with alien gadgets, channel dark forces from beyond the veil, or some combination of the two? Here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humanity emerges, hesitantly, into ruination. Almost nothing is left of the world as we knew it--settlements, forests, seas, mountains--all have been blasted into unfamiliarity. Horribly mutated animals hunt in packs through deformed woodland. Decrepit military robots stumble unknowingly through the ruins, sensors and logic centres blown. Alien soldiers, once impossibly powerful, cower in the wrecks of their ships, praying to heedless gods for rescue.</p>
<p>Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some numbers. Over 50 unique units in battle! Over 150 technologies! Six kinds of climate to worry about as you paint the map! 11 tiered resources to account for when running your economy! OK, that's enough numbers. Don't fret, there are more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/">the Steam page</a>.</p><p>The aforesaid Gladius came out in 2018, at the height of the pre-Edwin period. It appears to have been well-received. How terribly embarrassing, then, for my vaunted predecessors at Rock Paper Shotgun, who never managed to review it. Fraser (RPS in peace) did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-gladius-relics-of-war-killed-off-all-the-diplomats">write about the absence of diplomatic options</a>. Zephon appears to be cut from the same cloth, even if it's comparatively deficient in Tyranids.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-comic-hunters-board-game-review.1031367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-comic-hunters-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Collecting comic books has been a thing for as long as the comic industry has been around. There's an almost irresistable allure to having that one issue featuring the debut of your favorite hero or the one where a lovable character dies. I have dipped my toe into the comic-collecting hobby from time to time, and that was why I had to have Comic Hunters, if for nothing other than all the official comic covers the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel-themed board game</a> features. </p><div catalogid="b2d5765a-319b-4a3d-95dc-44885f751402" id="210193"><div id="210193" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel Comic Hunters</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Robert Coelho with Art by Diego Sa, Comic Hunters was initially released exclusively in Brazil back in 2020 but, thanks to Spin Master and Arcane Wonders, has now been released in the United States. In Comic Hunters, anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> compete with one another, traveling from flea markets to auction houses, in the attempt to snag those classic Marvel comic issues to make the most valuable collection of them all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core idea of Comic Hunters is that players draft cards to make the most valuable collection of comics. Each game allows you to set the market value either randomly or by hand-picking which heroes or types of comics are the most sought-after. To keep things interesting, drafting is done in five different ways, including players taking a card from a drawn hand of cards and passing the remainders to the next player, bidding on a blind pool of cards, and more. Once you have your new set of comics, you build your collections, paying for the cards you keep with the other cards you drafted but are opting to discard. The more of a certain hero or type of comic (first appearance, outfit change, epic battle, etc.) the more points you will get at the end of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a process that, once you've gone through it once or twice, you and the other players will fly through. It results in a game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">doesn’t take long to play</a> at all, but that initial time figuring out how all the different methods of drafting works can be a bit tedious as the rulebook doesn’t explain it very clearly. Multiple times during my first game, I had to stop and reread the rules to figure it out. Luckily, though, the whole game flow is quick and smooth once you wrap your brain around it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With being playable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> or with up to four players, Comic Hunters feels like a different game depending on your player count. My favorite setup is playing it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board game</a> against one other person. With two players, cards and player collections are manageable enough (each player’s sets are openly displayed in front of them) to make it a game where you can not only strategize what cards are best for you to expand your sets but also what could hinder your opponent too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At three and four players, the number of cards out and around the table can get overwhelming and instead often changed into more of a solitaire experience where I was only focused on my own sets and not stopping others, which admittedly may be more attractive to many players. For me, though, I appreciate the addition of that little bit of conflict. Fair warning: Comic Hunters can trigger decision paralysis, so be wary if that's an issue for you or the people you want to play against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several avenues to score points come the end the game – the sets of hero comics you have, the types of issues you have, the star tickets you have left that you didn’t use during auctions – so depending on how many comics you’ve managed to get, counting up the various symbols and figuring out how to best organize your sets for the most points can be a bit of a chore. My best recommendation to alleviate this is to simply keep track as you play with tally marks on how much of any one type you have in a set at any given time and adjust after the end of each set-building phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comic Hunters’ initial “WOW!” factor and draw is thanks to all of the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics/marvel-comics">Marvel comics</a> featured on the cards. It’s longevity and how well it keeps your interest will depend entirely on how much you like drafting and set collection games.  I had a fine time with the game (especially with the added adversary aspect at lower player counts mentioned earlier). I found the inclusion of having multiple drafting types helps the experience, but I never stopped wishing that there was another layer to the game. Maybe you could trade with others, or maybe there was a way to influence what the most desirable comics were midgame to try and swing things in your favor. Instead, you get drafting with a side of drafting, with a bit more drafting. The most interesting aspect of Comic Hunters is how you pay for the cards in your set with other cards you drafted, causing me to look for things I wanted and also chaff that I could snag to pay for the cards I wanted to collect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the art of all the covers is nice, and it was fun to stumble across issues featured in my own collection, the same can’t be said for the quality of the components themselves, with the gameboard being the only part that felt solid. The cardboard used for the player markers and comic-type tokens is incredibly thin, and even when I was punching them out of the board, they came on, I was worried I would tear them. The cards don’t feel much better; in my copy, the cards seemed to have an odd lip around them, with paper that's stiffer than I would like. In an ideal world, I would love to have a bit larger and sturdier cardboard tokens or better-feeling cards, but with the game coming in at $25, I can give the lower quality a bit of a pass.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODE6D?object_uuid=7265e117-ee68-4d71-b34a-ef48d7ab8436&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6J24?object_uuid=7265e117-ee68-4d71-b34a-ef48d7ab8436&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Barnes &amp; Noble</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 8, 2024 7:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">With a small box, a low price tag, and a healthy dose of Marvel nostalgia, Comic Hunters is an enticing game. For fans of drafting and set collection board games, Comic Hunters is an easy recommendation. If that mechanic isn’t quite your thing, then this may not be the game for you, even if you are a massive fan of Spider-Man and friends. Comic Hunters has a great idea and theme behind it. The idea of trying to hunt down that one elusive comic to complete your collection could easily be applied to versions that feature sports cards, DC comics, video games, and more.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve still only scratched the surface with our review unit so far, but am pulling together the various gameplay comparisons that we need for our review. So I’ve played lots of games in 10 minute sections, then changes some graphics settings and done it again, then switched console and done it again…</p>
<p>It has been…. repetitive, with my only respite coming in the hour-long session I had with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">Project ARC</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s jump on over to the much more interesting gaming that everyone else has been getting up to. <strong>Ade</strong> has played a little bit of Helldivers 2, has been reviewing Redacted, but has mainly spent a very complicated game of real life Tetris as he puts his life in boxes so that he can move house next week – “It’s stressful and confusing and I really can’t recommend. ????”</p>
<p>All the best with the move!</p>


<p>There’s much less moving and shaking for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s been locked in on Black Ops 6 multiplayer – “My combat report is showing a much improved kill/death ratio now that I’m starting to memorise map layouts and get to grips with the speedier player movement. There are some things about COD that never change, however, with squad mates completely ignoring objectives so they can work on their killstreaks being one of them. Still, I’m having an immense amount of fun and can’t wait for the first big content drop.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been on the Final Fantasy XVI warpath still, grabbing all the DLC and completing Echoes of Fallen already. He’s now moving on to the Rising Tide DLC, and found the new powers to be rather handy. He also dipped a toe back into Hydrophobia: Prophecy for a look back feature, and started replaying the wonderful Tearaway on his Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> loves three kinds of games: monster games, card games and walking around games. So… he’s obviously been playing a lot of Pokémon TCG Pocket this week, while enjoying all the delights of having a 6-month old. “Great little game that’s fun to dip in and out of. I’m considerig writing a review this afternoon (if I can find the time).”</p>

<p>As for our resident horror acolyte, <strong>Steve</strong>? Well, he was naturally on hand for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/slitterhead-review/">Slitterhead</a>, “a game that will definitely find a cult following but had too many issues for me to rate it as highly as I thought I would from the style alone. I think it’ll be one of those (like the recently remastered Shadows of the Damned) that’ll be the spur for lots of retrospectives and YouTube video essays and I’ll almost certainly be doing something with it academically regarding the setting and blood powers.</p>
<p>And then he has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/mario-luigi-brothership-review/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> arriving today for a total change of pace on some upcoming commutes.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Phasmophobia some more, “which takes ages to get to grips with because there’s too many ghosts, but is still fun in a deeply scary way. Doesn’t help that there’s only two of us playing either.”</p>

<p>And rounding things out for the week, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> had a bloody great time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro Awakening in PSVR 2</a>, which had him so wrapped up in the terror and suspense that his flatmate was shouting at him to stop screaming!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

The update is bringing more loadout options, maps, and teases for mid-season zombies reveals. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,195371" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a lot, especially when all crammed onto a single roadmap. <em>Black Ops 6 </em>Season 01 will go live on Thursday, November 14 at 12:00 p.m. ET across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. In addition to the multiplayer, zombies, and Warzone content and changes coming, the seasonal update also features skins for the operator Sevati “Sev” Dumas, as well as revised battle pass with both free and premium unlocks. It is by far the most complex and overwhelming battle pass I have ever seen. </p><p>Here is a top-line overview of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Control&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything coming to <em>Black Ops 6 </em>in season 1</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>﻿Hideout<br></li><li>Extraction </li><li>Heirloom</li><li>Racket (in-season)</li><li>Hacienda (in-season)</li><li>Nuketown Holiday (in-season)</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ransack</li><li>Prop Hunt</li><li>Multiplayer Ranked Play</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hand Cannon Scorestreak</li><li>Shadow Perk</li><li>High Roller Wildcard</li></ul><p><strong>Zombies</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Terminus (directed mode)</li><li>Liberty Falls (directed mode)</li><li>3 New Gobblegums</li><li>Citadelle Des Morts map (in-season)</li></ul><p><strong><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Maps: Area 99 (Resurgence), Urzikistan, and Rebirth Island</li><li>Gameplay: Omnimovement, BO6 Weapons, Equipment, and Perks, Prestige System, Body Shield, Dedicated Melee, Emotes &amp; Sprays, Streamlined Inventory, Mastery Camo, Killstreaks, and Wildcards</li></ul><p><strong>Weapons</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Krig C (Battle Pass AR)</li><li>Buffer Weight Stock (Attachment)</li><li>Dragon’s Breath (Attachment)</li><li>AMR Mod 4 (In-Season Event Sniper Rifle)</li><li>Cleaver (In-Season Event Melee)</li><li>Maelstrom (Event Shotgun)</li><li>Power Drill (Event Melee)</li><li>Sirin 9MM (Event Special)</li><li>Saug (Batatle Pass SMG)</li></ul><p><strong>Misc.</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sevati “Sev” Dumas Tier 100 operator</li><li>Brightmare Bundle</li><li>Tracer Pack: The Replacer</li><li>Golaith with Companion Finishing Move</li></ul></blockquote><p>Like I said, that’s a lot! Directed Mode is a notable addition for Zombies that will take players on a more guided tour through the wave-based mode’s story beats and objectives. Then, throughout the season, Zombies will get additional content, including a new Perk-A-Cola, Field Upgrade, Ammo Mod, and 18 more Augments to research. It sounds like most of that stuff won’t be hitting until mid-December at the earliest. </p><p>In the meantime, the update to<em> Call of Duty: Warzone</em> that integrates it with <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be the biggie. The free-to-play battle royale spin-off will be incorporating the ominimovement gameplay of the latest entry in the series, as well as bringing over all of its weapons, skins, and other knickknacks. The season 1 battle pass is $10 and includes a series of instant reward unlocks, including the pink-haired operator Sev as well as a helpful XP boost. </p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em> is currently part of Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S and PC. It’s a good deal for those who like to dive in for a month or two before moving on, though died-in-the-wool COD lifers are still better off buying the whole package upfront. For those still on the fence, however,  Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has said</a></span> Microsoft’s Netflix-like subscription service has helped get more people playing <em>Black Ops 6</em> than ever before. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Intel is gearing up to announce and launch its next-generation Battlemage GPU. According to known leaker Golden Pig Upgrade, Intel is aiming to going to launch the Battlemage graphics card in December.</p>



<p>No specifics about the card weren’t part of the claim nor was any information on how many cards will be part of this lineup. However, the leaker was clear enough about the timeline.</p>



<p>“Looking forward to the wonderful performance of Battlemage next month,” the <a href="https://weibo.com/3219724922/5098080466897502">Weibo post</a> reads via on-site translation. </p>



<p>Battlemage is the second-generation discrete GPU from Intel. It’s the follow up to the Intel Arc from 2022. Intel released three versions of the Arc graphics card: Arc 3, Arc 5, and Arc 7. With Battlemage, it’s been rumored that Intel will only be releasing budget-friendly cards that sit on the lower end of the market. A competitor to Nvidia’s or AMD’s top offerings shouldn’t be expected.</p>



<p>Still, even if the low-end rumors are true, more graphics cards can only be viewed as a positive for PC enthusiasts. More and more players are heading to PC gaming, and the more options there are, the better the cost becomes for everyone. </p>



<p>Intel hasn’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment on the rumored pending launch. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. Until then, please take the latest claims on Intel Battlemage with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>In addition to Intel’s pending new launch, both AMD and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-nvidia-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-release-date-rumors-continue-to-circulate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia are expected</a> to announce new graphics cards in early 2025 around CES.</p>

The emergence of a playlist for 10v10 might be what has most frothing at the mouth, though, as it offers bigger lobbies across many of Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer maps. Included in the list of maps is Nuketown, a map that is already notoriously chaotic in 6v6 matches, so expect even more chaos when hopping in for 10v10. While the standard Nuketown 24/7 playlist option will remain, fans can also now enjoy a new Stakeout 24/7 playlist.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/ss-0d3fffebfd9343ff4233a87967a6f63cc81757a5-1920x1080-1730718138609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 patch nerfs Recon and adds 10v10 playlist.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another highlight involves an additional nerf for Recon, which has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>a common complaint from players</u></a> for weeks. The Perk combo bonus gives players a few advantages in combat, including the ability to briefly see enemies through walls after spawning. The effect previously lasted for a whopping two seconds, with many drawing comparisons between it and unofficial cheats like wallhacks. It didn’t take long before Treyarch brought down that timer to only 1.5 seconds, and as promised, that’s now down to only one second with today’s patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer regulars will notice that they are no longer able to exit the map in Lowtown, too, with other more general changes tackling stability and XP earn rates.

A playlist update also adds larger and more chaotic player counts for multiplayer matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Recon Combat Specialty bonus basically gives players wallhacks for a brief time after respawning, highlighting enemy players on the map in red. This was a really overpowered feature at launch, but a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-patch-notes-include-major-nerfs-to-flashbangs-recon-bonus-and-snaking/1100-6527569/">recent update nerfed the time</a> down from 2 to 1.5 seconds. Unfortunately, that still wasn't impactful enough, so now Treyarch has further reduced the highlighted duration down to just 1 second.</p>
