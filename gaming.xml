			<p>At Gamescom 2024, NVIDIA announced the next wave of PC games featuring DLSS and RTX technologies, highlighted by BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Obsidian's Avowed.</p>
<p>Both fantasy RPGs will support NVIDIA DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation), NVIDIA Reflex, and ray tracing, though we don't know exactly which graphics effects will be enhanced. The most common ones are reflections, shadows, ambient occlusion, and global illumination.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by DICE's Frostbite engine, which has supported NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing in various Battlefield games. BioWare has recently shared the official PC requirements, which are pretty low, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-quite-low-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Needless to say, playing at 4K and 60+ FPS with ray tracing enabled will likely require a far beefier rig than what's listed in the recommended requirements. The developers will likely share more information soon since Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now about two months and a half away from launching.</p>

<p>It might take a while longer for Avowed since Obsidian has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> the game to February 18, 2025, officially in an attempt to avoid the cramped Fall game release schedule (but Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did</a> the same and placed itself just one week before Avowed).</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed | NVIDIA DLSS 3 &amp; Ray Tracing Premiere" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWeYmim3IFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3, DLAA, and Reflex will also be available in the soon-to-be-released Final Fantasy XVI PC port. These are just the three most famous games announced today by NVIDIA. Here's the remaining seventeen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Black Slate (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>Empire of Ants (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Eternal Strands (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>Funko Fusion (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Fragpunk (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>GreedFall II: The Dying World (NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution)</li>
<li>Killing Floor III (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Kingmakers (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Once Human (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Retrieval (RTXDI)</li>
<li>Spine (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Unawake (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Wuthering Waves (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, NVIDIA said there are now over 600 PC games and apps that support RTX technologies. On a separate note, GeForce NOW already supports the newly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Final Fantasy XVI demo. Moreover, a feature called Xbox Automatic Sign-On is coming this Thursday, allowing seamless access to PC Game Pass across all compatible GeForce NOW devices. A new GFN Ultimate data center is about to launch in Poland, too, expanding the service's reach in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Last but not least, today NVIDIA released a new Game Ready driver optimized for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Star Wars: Outlaws, Concord, and Final Fantasy XVI. As usual, you can download it via the official website or via apps like GeForce Experience and the new NVIDIA app.</p>
<p>PC gamers interested in Star Wars: Outlaws can potentially take advantage of the newly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-star-wars-outlaws-bundle-free-available-rtx-40-desktop-gpus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>RTX 40 Series Bundle, which will provide them with a game code as long as they buy an RTX 40 Series GPU or desktop/laptop from participating retailers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-7800-retro-console-faithfully-recreates-a-classic-this-winter.957705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari and Plaion have announced the Atari 7800+, a faithful recreation of the classic 1986 Atari 7800. It's set to launch around the world this winter and will be compatible with original 7800 cartridges as well.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the 7800+ is a "scaled-down, compact edition" of the original 7800, so it won't take up quite as much room in your setup. It's also got HDMI compatibility, so you can hook it up to modern displays with no problem.</p>
<p>The console will be compatible with both original 7800 cartridges and original 2600 carts, echoing the backwards compatibility of the original 7800. Just like its predecessor, it also won't be able to run 5200 cartridges, so you're out of luck if you've got a large 5200 library for some reason.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-7800-bentley-bears-crystal-quest.jpg?itok=aY1ImFlJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-7800-bentley-bears-crystal-quest.jpg?itok=2WK2hZ5K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new game has been created specially for the Atari 7800+.</figcaption></figure><p>Atari and Plaion say they guarantee "near-perfect compatibility with original and third-party Atari games", though, so your 2600 and 7800 libraries should be safe on the new 7800+.</p>
<p>Each 7800+ will come pre-packaged with a wireless CX78+ controller, which recreates the two-button setup of the original 7800's peripheral. You'll also get a copy of&nbsp;<em>Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest</em>, a brand new sequel to the Atari classic&nbsp;<em>Crystal Castles</em>.</p>
<p>A number of other new games, some of them based on IPs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-buys-up-12-classic-arcade-franchises-including-berzerk-and-more">acquired by Atari last year</a>, will also be available for the system, and the lineup will include "Atari releases for popular homebrew games", along with three "multi-game 2600+ cartridges" (which will, as a reminder, be compatible with the 7800+).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-7800-announcement-cx78-controller.jpg?itok=VpluuTD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-7800-announcement-cx78-controller.jpg?itok=eCZHn20z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Atari 7800+ will come with a CX78+ controller.</figcaption></figure><p>The Atari 7800+ will set you back $129.99, while an extra CX78+ controller will cost you $34.99. If you want to buy a CX40+ wireless joystick for glorious single-button gaming, you'll have to hand over a further $34.99.</p>
<p>Atari and Plaion are set to launch the Atari 7800+ sometime this winter. Stay tuned for more news on a specific release date, and while you wait, you can <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order the console here</a> if you like.</p>

The company has teamed up with Plaion to announce the Atari 7800 Plus, which comes equipped with an HDMI port to connect to modern televisions, alongside support for both Atari 2600 and 7800 game cartridges — just like the original console.</p><p>The $129.99 Atari 7800 Plus is <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800">available to preorder now</a>, with a global release expected in “winter 2024,” according to Atari’s press release. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034344/atari-400-mini-release-date-price">other mini-console recreations</a> the company has released in recent years, the Atari 7800 Plus is visually identical to the original 1986 console (aside from being shrunken down). Players can also choose between running games in widescreen mode or 4:3 aspect ratio to preserve the feeling of playing on retro hardware.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Atari 7800 Plus comes bundled with the new CX78 Plus Wireless Gamepad (pictured).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atari</cite></p></div><p>There are two new wireless controllers launching alongside the Atari 7800 Plus. The CX78 Plus Wireless Gamepad — a recreation of the console’s original two-button controller — comes bundled with the Atari 7800 Plus but can also be purchased separately for $34.99. The gamepad also wirelessly connects to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">the Atari 2600 Plus recreation</a> released last year and can be connected to a PC via a USB-C adapter. There’s also the $34.99 CX40 Plus Wireless Joystick, which is sold separately and carries the same support.</p><div><figcaption><em>Like the CX78 gamepad, the CX40 Plus Wireless Joystick can also be used on PC or the Atari 2600 Plus mini-console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atari</cite></p></div><p>Atari touts that the Atari 7800 Plus has “near-perfect compatibility” with original and third-party Atari games. Only one game is being shipped with the console itself — a specially designed cartridge for the <em>Crystal Castles</em> sequel, <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest </em>— but 10 additional titles will be available to purchase separately for $29.99. You can <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800">preorder the 7800 Plus right here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224268/nvidia-geforce-now-xbox-account-linking-automatic-sign-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia will soon let you link an Xbox account to its GeForce Now streaming service to enable automatic sign-in for supported games. Starting on August 22nd, the new account linking feature will mean you only need to sign-in and link an Xbox profile once so that it’s stored for all future GeForce Now sessions.</p><p>“This new feature joins Xbox game library sync on GeForce Now, which allows members to sync their supported Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft Store games to their cloud streaming library,” explains Nvidia.</p><p>Nvidia first started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841163/microsoft-xbox-pc-game-pass-nvidia-geforce-now">rolling out access to PC Game Pass</a> and Microsoft Store titles on GeForce Now last year, before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963718/nvidia-geforce-now-pc-game-pass-xbox-account-sync">adding account syncing</a> to bring games from Microsoft’s store to the GeForce Now library. Those features provided access, but without automatic sign-in, you had to manually authenticate each time you used the GeForce Now service. Now, it’s simply set it and forget it.</p><p>Nvidia’s improvements for Xbox games on GeForce Now come just weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200819/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-integration-xbox-store-pages">Microsoft integrated GeForce Now</a> into its Xbox game pages on the web. The integration allows you to pick between either Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia’s GeForce Now service when you view a game listing on the web.</p><p>All of this close collaboration has been possible thanks to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608930/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-xbox-games-announcement">10-year deal</a>&nbsp;between Nvidia and Microsoft to allow Nvidia to license Xbox PC games for GeForce Now, including Activision Blizzard titles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even though you may not have a use for them in the first couple of hours, you’ll eventually be able to make helpful medicines to aid you in battle, and you’ll be happy you’ve been collecting materials for them.</p><figure id="" data-id="563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-recommend-id="image://563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1093" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-recommend-id="image://563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1093" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114885"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t fret—dying doesn’t have any major consequences</strong></h2><p>Unlike traditional soulslike games, dying in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> doesn’t have any significant consequences besides sending you back to the closest shrine with all enemies respawned. This means you won’t have to worry about the common soulslike mechanic of dropping your experience on death. Instead, you’ll maintain all of your earned Will and be ready to give things another go.</p><h2 id="h114886"><a id=""></a><strong>You can always fight the Wandering Wight later</strong></h2><p>The Wandering Wight is a boss found romping around the right side of the forest. If you’re patient and practice enough, you can maybe take him down when you first meet him. More likely, though, you’ll want to come back a little later when you’ve upgraded your staff and gear (maybe around the time you reach the Black Wind Cave). You’ll find defeating him much easier by then.</p><h2 id="h114887"><a id=""></a><strong>Prepare yourself before facing Lingxuzi</strong></h2><p>Lingxuzi won’t be an overwhelmingly challenging boss for soulslike veterans, but he still hits like a truck and can make quick work of you if you haven’t fully wrapped your head around the game’s unique combat mechanics.</p><figure id="" data-id="9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-recommend-id="image://9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1102" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-recommend-id="image://9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1102" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With this in mind, aim to hit around level 9 or 10 before taking on Lingxuzi. When you have enough Sparks obtained, purchase at least the first three health upgrades in the Survival skill tree. Additionally, make sure to craft the Pilgrim’s Armor at a shrine for some added defense. With that extra health and defense, you’ll be in a much better position to tank a few hits while fighting Lingxuzi, so go give him hell.<br></p><p>If you need to collect some extra Will to purchase some skills or crafting materials, you can grind in the “Outside the Forest” area as needed.</p><h2 id="h114888"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t miss a massive health boost after defeating Lingxuzi</strong></h2><p>After defeating Lingxuzi, you’ll be free to proceed into a temple in front of you. While you may be tempted to waltz through and head down to the nearby shrine to rest, make sure you stop inside the temple first.</p><p>On the left side of the inner temple is a Celestial Medicine you can pick up that will provide you with a significant health increase, further improving your survivability for the dangers ahead.</p><h2 id="h114889"><a id=""></a><strong>Also don’t miss a massive mana boost in Black Wind Cave</strong></h2><p>After defeating a certain boss, you’ll enter an area called Black Wind Cave. As you work through the first part of this location, you’ll have a path to the left that leads out to a wooden deck with a meditation point. Right by the meditation point is another Celestial Medicine, and this one will vastly increase your mana reserves, allowing you to use your spells more often.</p><figure id="" data-id="4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-recommend-id="image://4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-recommend-id="image://4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114890"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t overlook Spirit Skills</strong></h2><p>You’ll meet an NPC fairly early on that will upgrade your gourd to allow you to absorb the spirits of some bosses. Doing so will grant you their Spirit Skill, which lets you briefly transform into them in battle and perform an action when you’ve built up enough Qi. These can dish out some major damage, especially to bosses. But more importantly, they grant passive bonuses when equipped—such as the Wandering Wight’s increased defense.</p><p>You can even upgrade each of these Spirits at a shrine by selecting “Cultivate Spirits” under the “Self-Advance” tab.

<p>The release of NHL 25 is less than two months away and the first details of the game have been leaked ahead of the official reveal. And EA is to blame for the NHL 25 leaks.</p>



<p>The publisher had a reveal and trailer set for Thursday, August 22 at 11am. However, when EA Sports uploaded it to the game’s official account, they left it unlisted allowing it to be seen and grabbed by whomever. It wasn’t until it began making the rounds that it was finally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EDHgsy8w8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made private</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thanks to the early look at the NHL 25 reveal trailer, a few details have been confirmed about the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-nhl-25-leaks">What’s In The NHL 25 Leaks?</h2>



<p>First, NHL 25 will feature the Hughes brothers — Luke, Jack, and Quinn — on the covers of this year’s game. It’ll mark the first time that a set of brothers will appear on the cover of a major sports video game.</p>



<p>The game will  also see the return of James Cybulski as play-by-play as well as feature the official jerseys for Utah Hockey Club right at launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On to gameplay, NHL 25 features new game mechanics that run on “ICE-Q Intelligence”. The game also features revamped vision controls that EA Sports is calling “next-gen vision control” and the skating has been updated to include over 250 new animations. </p>



<p>There is also new foundational AI and reactive player actions that will allow the game to better mimic what players see in real life. How that works, though, won’t be noticeable until players can get their hands on the game themselves</p>



<p>Neither a release date nor official platforms were  confirmed in the leaks. What was confirmed, however, is that EA Sports is doing with NHL 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it did with EA FC 25</a>. If you pay $100 for the Deluxe Edition of the game, you get to play it at release. Those who pay the $70 standard will get access to the game a week later.</p>

Upon arriving in London in 2009, I was frequently called upon to answer press and media inquiries about Japanese history. These engagements, ranging from news reports to documentaries, broadened my horizons and provided an opportunity to share my knowledge with a wider audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the earliest and most memorable of these engagements was as a historical advisor to a major studio film production centered on early modern Japan. This project marked the beginning of my foray into the world of film and screen media. The job was to help maintain the historical accuracy of a fiction-fantasy film set in early modern Japan.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lessons from the Film Industry"><span>Lessons from the Film Industry</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a promising start, the project soon encountered significant challenges, particularly due to cultural miscommunications between the Japanese cast and the Anglo-American production team. Over and again, I tried to emphasize the significance of the Akō Vendetta story, as retold in the classic drama of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABshingura">Chūshingura (忠臣蔵, The Treasury of Loyal Retainers)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which has had a profound cultural and historical impact in Japan since it was first performed in 1748. The Chūshingura embodies themes of loyalty, honor, and sacrifice that have become deeply embedded in contemporary&nbsp; Japanese culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The script of the film I was advising had been originally written by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Amini">Hossein Amini</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in consultation with historian </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Turnbull_(historian)">Stephen Turnbull</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Theirs was an impressive work. However, as pre-production progressed into production, the director cut and restructured the script, resulting in a movie that failed to capture the depth and richness of the historical events upon which it was based. This experience underscored a critical lesson: the importance of balancing historicity with artistic license and commercial viability.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="History as Digital Interactive Storytelling"><span>History as Digital Interactive Storytelling</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The potential of video games to engage players with history first struck me in the 1980s when I encountered titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobunaga's_Ambition">Nobunaga’s Ambition (信長の野望, Nobunaga no Yabō)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These early strategy games allowed players to immerse themselves in the political and military machinations of historical periods. Over the decades, the genre evolved significantly, with advances in technology enabling more complex narratives and immersive gameplay experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, while commercial games often succeed as narrative devices, they frequently prioritize gameplay over historical accuracy. This approach, driven by the commercial pressures of the gaming industry, can lead to a superficial engagement with historical material.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqysmS4lxwQ" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ghost of Tsushima"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Historian </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/history/faculty/ac73447">Adam Clulow's</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> analysis of Ghost of Tsushima offers important insights for game designers striving to balance historical authenticity with engaging gameplay. Clulow highlights the game’s depiction of the Mongol invasions of Japan in the late 13th century as a prime example of how video games can captivate players while also oversimplifying complex historical events. The game presents a narrative that is visually stunning and immersive, yet it often sacrifices historical precision to enhance the player’s experience. This trade-off, while understandable from a commercial perspective, poses significant challenges for educators and historians who aim to use such games as educational tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ghost of Tsushima is praised for its beautiful recreation of Tsushima Island and its detailed portrayal of samurai culture, but Clulow points out that the game’s narrative choices sometimes create a misleading picture of history. The game frames the Mongol invasion in stark, binary terms—good versus evil, invaders versus defenders—without adequately conveying the nuanced political, cultural, and social dynamics at play during this period. For instance, the game’s portrayal of the samurai as noble warriors defending Japan from barbaric invaders simplifies the complexities of samurai roles and motivations, as well as the internal conflicts within Japanese society at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For game designers, Clulow underscores the importance of critically engaging with the historical sources that inform their narratives. Many historical video games, Ghost of Tsushima included, rely heavily on popular histories or outdated interpretations, which can perpetuate inaccuracies or reinforce simplistic views of the past. Clulow advocates for a more nuanced approach, where game designers collaborate closely with historians to ensure that their games reflect the latest scholarly research and offer players a more accurate and sophisticated understanding of history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite these challenges, Ghost of Tsushima also demonstrates the potential of video games to introduce players to historical settings and events in a way that is both engaging and informative. Clulow suggests that game designers can learn from the game’s success by incorporating more complex and layered narratives that challenge players to think critically about the past. This might involve presenting multiple perspectives on historical events, exploring the motivations of different characters, and highlighting the uncertainties and ambiguities that are inherent in any historical narrative. By doing so, games can not only entertain but also educate, encouraging players to explore history in a deeper and more meaningful way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ghost of Tsushima serves as both a model and a cautionary tale for game designers. While it excels in creating an immersive and visually striking historical environment, it also illustrates the dangers of oversimplification and the need for a more critical and informed approach to historical representation in games. Clulow’s work emphasizes that with careful attention to historiography, video games can offer rich and nuanced portrayals of the past that engage and educate players, rather than merely entertain.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Takeaways for Game Design:"><span>Key Takeaways for Game Design:</span></h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understand the Historical Context: When working with historical narratives, it’s crucial to grasp the cultural and historical significance of the events and stories being portrayed.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balance Accuracy with Entertainment: While it’s essential to stay true to the historical narrative, consider how to make it engaging and accessible for a broader audience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Collaboration is Key: Work closely with historians and cultural experts to ensure that the final product respects the source material while appealing to your target audience.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NxBmS1nl38" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The HashimaXR Project"><span>The HashimaXR Project</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My first foray into historiographical video game design was with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thehashimaxrproject.org/">HashimaXR Project</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

We had to continuously test and refine our designs, not just for historical accuracy but also for player engagement. The iterative process was crucial in ensuring that the final product was both educational and enjoyable. This project was a prime example of how digital tools can enhance our understanding of history, offering new ways to explore and interact with the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The HashimaXR Project demonstrated the potential of game engines like Unreal as tools for public history. By making the history of Hashima Island accessible to a global audience through an interactive virtual environment, we were able to engage people who might not otherwise have been interested in this aspect of Japanese history. This project has inspired me to continue exploring the possibilities of digital humanities and historiographical video game design as powerful means of education and public engagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most rewarding aspects of the HashimaXR Project was witnessing how effectively it engaged a diverse and global audience. The ability to reach people from different cultural backgrounds, who might never visit Hashima Island in person, highlighted the immense power of digital tools in public history. The virtual environment not only captured the attention of gamers but also attracted educators, historians, and casual learners who were curious about the industrial heritage of Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By creating an interactive and immersive experience, we were able to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of Hashima Island’s complex history, demonstrating that video games can be a valuable medium for historical education and engagement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has only been out for a handful of hours, but it's already soared past every other game on Steam to snag the platform's highest-ever 24-hour player count peak.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam's own charts</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has already reached a 24-hour peak of 1,903,342 players, which is, of course, also its all-time peak. That's a handy victory over&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, which is now in second place with a measly 1,368,431.</p>
<p>Developer GameScience's game still has a ways to go if it wants to claim the all-time player peak crown, though. That accolade is currently held by Krafton's&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, which has&nbsp;an impressive all-time player peak count of&nbsp; 3,257,248.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-steam-charts-flask.jpg?itok=DmnAvqbe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-steam-charts-flask.jpg?itok=fiNQKjTB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is already proving phenomenally popular.</figcaption></figure><p>It goes without saying that this makes&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>the most successful single-player game of all time on Steam, at least by the metric of highest 24-hour player count.</p>
<p>Other games with a single-player slant, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>(953,426 all-time peak) and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>&nbsp;</em>(1,054,388 all-time peak), can't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s numbers, and since the game has only been out for a few hours, its total is only likely to climb as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, where is all of this interest coming from? Well, according <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless</a>,&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s player base is predominantly Chinese, with 88.1% of the game's Steam players hailing from China. The next-highest total is the US with 3%, followed by Hong Kong with 1.6%.</p>
<p>Given the fact that&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>is based on a classical Chinese novel, that split makes a certain degree of sense, but it's also still pretty early in the day for a lot of Americans, so many from the US won't have had the chance to play the game yet.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's a single-player action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience, and it's the company's first game.</p>
<p>Based loosely on the Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, the game sees a young monkey warrior journeying across a mythical land to recover six artifacts left behind by legendary monkey king Sun Wukong after a fateful battle with the Celestial Court.</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The game is also set to arrive on Xbox Series X|S at some point in the future.

Wilson's 99 makes her the highest-rated WNBA player in NBA 2K history, and on par with the greats in the mens' league--NBA 2K only rarely hands out 99 ratings and often launches without a single player rated 99, as happened <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nba-2k24-player-ratings-the-12-best-players-revealed/2900-4831/" data-ref-id="2900-4831">last year</a>.</p><p>The WNBA's top five rookies have also been announced with some impressive OVRs.

            <p>The creator of the now-defunct Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 mod, H2M, has opened up about what happened when Activision slapped the mod with a cease and desist, admitting, "the past couple of days have not gone to plan".</p>
<p>Although the mod - which upgraded Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer mode - was announced over a year ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-h2m-shuts-down-after-cease-and-desist-demand">the cease and desist arrived the day before the mod was scheduled to be released</a> last week, forcing the project to "shut down [...] immediately and permanently".</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, unhappy Modern Warfare 2 fans jumped onto the Steam page to express <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055689836/recommended/1962660/">their dismay</a>.</p>
<p>In the brief video embedded above, Watchful Wolf talked about the fallout following the decision to cancel the mod, as well as "share the reasoning" they believe Activision had for blocking it.</p>
<p>"Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining - and how close it is to Black Ops 6 releasing and kinda the marketing and the beta and stuff for that - they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6," Watchful Wolf said, stressing that this was just how they interpreted the cease and desist letter rather than the formal legal position of Activision.</p>
<p>"So, with that said, for people who suggested 'you should have just made it on BO3' or something like that because they allow mod support… well, I don't think any project, no matter where it was, [would have been permitted] if it garnered such popularity so close to a new game releasing.</p>

            <p>Our <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.</p>
<p>All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc". </p><!--more-->
<p>The Google Doc in question is apparently from a representative of Chinese publisher Hero Games, one of developer Game Science's largest external investors, who have also partnered through investment with Kuro Games Studio, creators of Wuthering Waves. It was shared on Bluesky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/exserv.bsky.social">French journalist Benoit Reinier</a> over the weekend and subsequently written up by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda">VideoGames SI</a>. IGN have also now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid">verified it</a>, citing an anonymous source. I've asked Game Science for a comment on the matter, but I haven't had anything back. </p>
<p>The email outlines various "Do's and Don'ts" for people streaming or making other types of content about Black Myth: Wukong. Under "Do's", we find only "enjoy the game!" Under "Don'ts", we find the below:</p>
<blockquote> <p>• Do NOT insult other influencers or players.</p>
<p> • Do NOT use any offensive language/humor.</p>
<p> • Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse.</p>
<p> • Do NOT use trigger words such as 'quarantine' or 'isolation' or 'COVID-19'.</p>
<p>• Do NOT discuss content related to China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cautionary note against "feminist propaganda" is a reminder that Game Science have yet to respond to allegations of pervasive sexist behaviour from November last year. In a lengthy report for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a>, Rebekah Valentine and Khee Hoon Chan described "a studio plagued by claims of sexism", linking this to misogyny elsewhere in the Chinese games industry and on the government-firewalled Chinese internet. The developers have raised the drawbridge in response: when Edders attended a preview event earlier this year, they refused to say anything on the subject in advance. </p>
<p>The request not to focus on Covid, meanwhile, seems to reflect the Chinese government's track record for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnkednnp400o">censoring discussion of the disease and preventative measures</a>.</p>
<p>I know little about the internal workings of Chinese game publishing or the Chinese gaming community, but yesterday Lu-Hai Liang published an interesting editorial for <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Black-Myth-Wukong-release-could-redefine-China-s-gaming-industry">Nikkei</a> in which he explores Black Myth: Wukong's importance to the regional games industry and to Chinese players. It's a prestigious, "triple-A" release from a country that, in Liang's analysis, lacks a track record for "premium" single player offerings due to government regulation of consoles, and is associated overseas with free-to-play gacha mechanics like those found in Genshin Impact - to say nothing of sinophobic reactions to the international investments of Chinese publishers like Tencent. </p>
<p>In Liang's view, Wukong's evident quality and global popularity have made it attractive to Chinese nationalists, and this has at times mushroomed into jingoistic dog-piling of the game's critics - especially in the wake of IGN's report into sexism at Game Science. "There is an edge to the online response and the attachment Chinese players feel for Black Myth: Wukong can tip into nationalistic pride," Liang writes. </p>
<p>I'll let you know if I hear anything back from the developers. In the meantime, Hero Games have just announced CrisisX, the tale of a devastating infestation in a quiet US coastal town. It'll be on show at Gamescom this week - I wonder if they'll ask booth attendees to avoid mentioning quarantines in their coverage.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/HERO-GAMES-ANNOUNCES-CRISISX">a press release about CrisisX</a>, Hero Games's CEO Daniel Wu also describes the company's ambition to expand their publishing operations into western markets. "We are deeply invested in the global markets, and with CrisisX, we aim to take Hero Games to the next level," he wrote. "We feel that now is the time to introduce ourselves and our products to a wider audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has given us our best look yet at its upcoming animated series, Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft.</p>
<p>The show is scheduled to make its debut on the streaming service this autumn, and features the vocal talents of the MCU's Hayley Atwell as Lara Croft. It's all set to take place after the events of the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, which comprised Tomb Raider (2013), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>

<p>"Following the events of the Survivor Trilogy, Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) has abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures," reads the official blurb. "But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artefact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection."</p>
<p>As you would expect from a Tomb Raider anything, the upcoming show will see Lara travelling to many exotic locales, and - of course - heading into some strange and forgotten tombs. Here, Lara will be "forced to confront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to become", the show teases.</p>
<p>Along with Atwell, Earl Baylon is reprising his role as Jonah from the Survivor trilogy of games. And, while I can't say 100 percent right now, I do believe that's Lara meeting up with Alex's computer wiz sister Kaz in the trailer (which you can see above). Kaz is the first confirmed gay character within the Tomb Raider series, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">introduced in the Tomb Raider comics by Rhianna Pratchett</a>. </p>

		<p>In 2010, Enslaved Odyssey to the West made its entrance onto the gaming scene. It wasn’t the most challenging game out there, nor did it bring with it a defining gameplay mechanic, but Enslaved had something that made it stand out: the heart showcased by its characters and engaging story. Just like the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, it takes inspiration from Chinese tale Journey to the West, and it’s a story that explores the themes of fear, loss, cooperation, and the changing nature of relationships, which is made all the better as central characters Monkey, Trip, and Pigsy interact with each other so well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved - PS3 / X360 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmfAORuigW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Revisiting Enslaved Odyssey to the West 14 years after its release, and the last time I played it, made me consider whether I’d been seeing the game through rose-tinted glasses. If we really want to be reductive, Enslaved Odyssey to the West is an escort mission spread out over eight hours. At the start of the game, Monkey and Trip, who do not know each other, escape from a slaver’s airship, crashing down into the ruins of our civilisation. The name of Enslaved comes from the very literal enslaving of Monkey by Trip. While Monkey is out cold, Trip crowns him with a slaver headpiece, which allows her to give him commands. It also links the two, so if Trip dies, Monkey dies. Trip is out in the real wider world for the first time, and in her first interaction with Monkey, she saw a musclebound man chasing and shouting at her.</p>


<p>Trip doesn’t enslave Monkey to use him as a tool, but to guarantee her own safety as she finds herself in the company of a man who could quite easily cause her serious harm. She doesn’t know his intentions, and this is the only way she feels that she can be safe. Of course, Monkey is unhappy with the situation but soon accepts his fate and works with Trip to get her home. The story doesn’t follow a typical master and slave theme though. In most situations, Monkey is in charge and takes control, often having to order Trip around to move to places or carry out tasks. There are times Trip makes requests, but they are given as general instructions and not orders.</p>
<p>Despite, the name and the situation, both Monkey and Trip learn that the only way they can survive the world is through cooperation and partnership. The fall of our civilisation is not outright explained, as it happened a couple of hundred years ago, and neither of the two main characters are sure. What we can surmise from all of the mechs running around is that these robots were used in war and either turned on humans or were programmed to turn on them, which led to the majority of humanity being killed while some survivors created smaller enclaves or roamed alone, trying to survive in a world where danger lurked.</p>


<p>It is these dangers that the two navigate, Monkey through combat and Trip through her technical knowledge. She is the one Monkey relies on to operate controls and cause distractions, as well as upgrade his gear, while she relies on Monkey to keep her safe from the mechs that attack. They both later come to rely on Pigsy, who enjoyably looks like a pig and acts like a pig as well, to help them. Pigsy has his own goals but is happy to lend his services, though not without almost getting Monkey killed on purpose and hitting on Trip, who at this point has just found her father dead. Pigsy is portrayed as unlikeable, but at the end of the game he makes a big sacrifice for the others. In his standalone DLC, again Pigsy comes across as an idiot and braggart, but enjoys some character growth as he learns that he had what he needed by his side all that time.</p>
<p>Returning to the combat, and it is very basic compared to the games that have followed in the last 14 years. Enemies attack in small groups, with Monkey wielding a staff that can stun and destroy enemies through melee attacks, or firing plasma. There are a few enemy types and most are easy to take down, and the majority of the boss fights, while entertaining and set in interesting arenas, are quite repetitive as well. Even navigation is straightforward, with climbing points literally glowing and really not possible to miss at all taking away any challenge of finding your way. The camera is janky too at times, moving so focus on enemies is lost, letting them disappear off screen and attack from range. Yet, none of this takes away from the game’s charm. The world and the characters are in some way relatable, each going through their own development and growth. Monkey from a gruff loner to someone who stands up and fights for those by his side, Trip from a scared, lost, and unsure person to having more confidence in her abilities to be able to survive the world.</p>

<p>The final showdown at Pyramid also poses an ethical question: what is the nature of real life? We find that those who have been captured have not been enslaved but placed in a simulation to live lives from the old world, instead of having to survive in the harsh reality of its ruins. Monkey glimpses this world and calls it beautiful, but Trip destroys it all before asking if what she has done is right? We will never know as there is no sequel coming, but a big part of it would have been the fallout from Pyramid’s destruction. You suddenly have hundreds of people yanked from a reality where they had families and friends, and shoved back into the harsh fallen world. This could lead to mass mental trauma and PTSD as people grieve those they have lost, and may no longer be capable of surviving. However, it can also be argued that these people were enslaved to an idea that no longer existed and needed to be pulled out so they could build a new world.</p>
<p>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is still worth a playthrough now, both for those who played it way back, and for those who have never experienced it. You will come away from the game having enjoyed yourself and a bit let down that plans for a sequel were cancelled.</p>

            <p>Our unlucky planet in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-waste-disposal">Wasteland Waste Disposal</a> has suffered not just one apocalypse but all of them. Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you. </p>

<p>It looks like your mobile metal fortress will be a big focus, as you upgrade it with new gear and pop bits of scaffolding on the exterior to make room for smelting pots and roof gardens. But acid rain and radioactive storms may weather the hull, according to developers Kluk Digital. The other major thing you'll be doing is lowering yourself to the earth's banjaxed surface on a big elevator and doing a lot of environmental cleanup. We see our hero driving in a little digger and a forklift, for example, steadily tidying up a small city neighbourhood. There will also be creatures to collect and farm, with helpful or harmful habits. "Not all organisms are created equally useful," say the game's creators.</p>

The red muck of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/viscera-cleanup-detail">Viscera Cleanup Detail</a> is a gag stretched out like a yellow rubber glove, until it becomes a kind of compelling chore. Its down-to-earth equivalent, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, fills me with a healthy fear because I know if I start playing it I will never stop. But my favourite game about recycling is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, which sees you lasering metal and glass in zero gravity, surrounded by giant disposal machinery that will slurp you up just as quickly as it swallows old passenger seats. </p>
<p>All these games fill you with a compulsion to turn goo to gleam, or gnarl to neatness. And seeing the timelapse of the bouffant beautifier in Wasteland Waste Disposal as they scurry around hoovering up leaves, twigs and mud to turn an urban ruin into habitable space is very much activating my "tidy up" glands. The developers want to create a "small open world" partly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, they say, which is a nice mash-up of influences. Many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/search?q=open+world+#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=open%20world%20&amp;gsc.page=1">open world games</a> can afford to be more compact. Looking at you, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>There's no release yet but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946140/Wasteland_Waste_disposal/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, if you're the detoxifying type.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 10.30am UK:</strong> Black Myth: Wukong - Game Science's action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology - has had an impressive debut on Steam, surpassing record concurrent player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 and Dota 2. In just a few short hours, it has already become the most played single-player title of all time on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Black Myth: Wukong is currently the fourth most played game of all time on Valve's platform, with only Counter-Strike 2, Palworld and PUBG: Battlegrounds ahead of it in terms of peak concurrent players.</p>

<p>Since its release, the game has recorded a concurrent player peak of 1,443,570. By comparison, Cyberpunk 2077's all-time concurrent player peak is sitting at 1,054,388. Elden Ring's concurrent all-time peak, meanwhile, is 953,426. </p>
<p>As for how China-specific interest in Black Myth: Wukong is, GameDiscoverCo founder Simon Carless notes very. In a post on social media platform X, Carless shared a chart revealing an estimated 88 percent of the game's players on Steam are from China. </p> <div>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong has not been without controversy, though. Prior to its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">posts from Game Science CEO Féng Jì</a> including sexualised and misogynistic language were reported. More recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> also reported further on the studio's history with sexism.</p>
<p>Then, just this weekend, images of a leaked document sent to influencers surfaced online, requesting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-studio-requests-influencers-not-include-feminist-propaganda-or-covid-19-references-in-coverage">do not include "politics", "feminist propaganda", or references to Covid-19</a> in their Black Myth: Wukong coverage.</p>

<p>We recently awarded Black Myth: Wukong three out of five stars.</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer's Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
