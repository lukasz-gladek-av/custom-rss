<p>A release date is coming "Soon"</p>

<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6823f9ff7d40/yooka-replaylee.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Playtonic Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, a remaster of the 2017 3D collectathon platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, is "content complete" and a release date announcement is "coming...SoonTM".</p>
<p>This comes from PM Studios, the physical game publisher who is handling Yooka-Replaylee's release. The company shared a video on Bluesky giving us a very short explanation on what to expect.</p>
<p>The video confirms that the game is "content complete" and Playtonic are currently in the playtesting phase, looking for bugs to iron out.</p>

<p>We don't know when that "soon" is, of course. It could be the Indie World showcase on Thursday, but it also could be at gamescom Opening Night Live, which is on 19th August.</p>
<p>Basically, there are many places we could find out, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to this remaster in the comments</em>.</p>

                <p>As CEO of Bungie, Harold Ryan helped push the live-service genre forward with Halo and Destiny. Years after leaving Bungie, Ryan says he's observed that fans are speaking with their wallets and telling publishers that live-service is "not appropriate" for all games.</p><p>"I think that model is appropriate for some games, but I don't think it's appropriate for all games," Ryan told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/weve-had-to-evolve-the-long-awaited-first-games-from-probablymonsters-indicate-a-surprise-change-of-tack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>.

Some high-profile examples have included<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301"> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/" data-ref-id="2900-5747">Concord</a>, though there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yet-another-live-service-game-is-shutting-down-just-months-after-launch/1100-6520621/" data-ref-id="1100-6520621">numerous other titles closing down</a> as well.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/10-live-service-games-made-up-more-than-40-of-last-months-us-playtime-on-playstation-and-xbox/1100-6529723/" data-ref-id="1100-6529723">relatively small number of live-service games are making up a big proportion of play time</a>, and this data might help explain why other games in the live-service genre aren't faring as well. Of course, there are numerous other factors at play as well.</p><p>Part of the reason why 2K's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a> was priced at $50 is because the publisher believes there is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">audience and appetite for less-expensive, more linear games that don't require huge time commitments.</a></p><p>Ryan left Bungie in 2016 after 16 years with the company. He's now the CEO and founder of ProbablyMonsters, a company that assists developers with "early stage infrastructure" and support to help get games off the ground. The company just revealed its first two games, a rogue-like action game called Storm Lancers for Nintendo Switch and a psychological horror game called Ire: A Prologue for PC. ProbablyMonsters formerly owned Concord developer Firewalk Studios, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-acquires-another-studio-headed-by-bungie-veterans/1100-6513445/" data-ref-id="1100-6513445">selling it to Sony in 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">only for Sony to close the game and shutter the studio in 2024</a></p><p>Ryan said he would make another live-service game if he saw the "right game idea and the right audience." But he pushed back against the idea that a developer should focus too much on the business model. "I think [for] sustainable careers, I think for the industry, it's pretty clear that we can't just pick a business model and say that's a reason to make a game," he said.</p><p>As for Bungie, the company has undergone significant changes in recent times, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a major studio reorganization in 2024.</a> Bungie's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>, is a live-service title that publisher Sony believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">won't suffer the same fate as Concord.</a> The game was previously set for release in September but has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely.</a> Despite Concord's struggles, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">remains invested in live-service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">as does Ubisoft.</a></p><p>Ryan reflected on the upheaval at Bungie, saying, "It feels like they're in the very same place that almost everyone in the industry is, where the things that were working and reliable before aren't quite as reliable."</p><p>Ryan said it's his hope that developers across the industry can find a "sustainable business model" for their game that makes players happy and brings in enough revenue for studios to "pay the bills."</p><p>"Everyone can't be the number one most successful game in the industry," he said. "But I think we all could be shipping successful games."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-shonen-manga-right-now-is-about-a-niche-performance-artist%E2%80%99s-fall-from-grace.1262907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, I treated <em>Akane-banashi</em> like a dessert, saving the chapters for last every Sunday as the highlight of my <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-new-manga-to-read-2025-2000560252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Shonen Jump lineup</a>. Then I got greedy. I stopped reading—not out of disinterest, but to stockpile chapters and indulge later. With the announcement of an <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-08-04/akane-banashi-rakugo-manga-gets-tv-anime-in-2026-by-studio-zexcs/.227338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming anime adaptation</a>, I broke my moratorium, expecting to see my girl shine once more in her series. Instead, I returned to find my best girl fighting for her life in a bold deviation of shonen tropes that only further cements the manga’s growing legacy as a truly remarkable work.&nbsp;</p><p>The best kind of manga can focus its stories on a niche interest and elevate it into compelling storytelling through strong writing and a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genuine appreciation for its subject</a>. <em>Akane-banashi</em> is the top modern example of this. The ongoing series, which started in 2022 by writer Yuki Suenaga and illustrator Takamasa Moue, is a performance art drama. The story follows Akane Osaki, a teenager who aspires to make a career in <a href="https://www.japansociety.org.uk/review?review=549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rakugo</a>. In this traditional Japanese solo performance art form, an artist portrays multiple characters using only their voice, gestures, and a fan to bring the story to life. Driven by a love for the art form and a desire to uncover why her father was famously banished from it, Akane works to become an accomplished rakugoka.</p><p>Although <em>Akane-banashi</em> might not seem like typical shonen at first glance—especially to those who assume “girl on cover” indicates a shoujo vibe—the manga is, at its core, a masterful example of shonen storytelling. Akane’s journey to redeem her disgraced father is more than just a personal mission; it immerses her in the rakugo world, a hierarchy resembling the <em>Demon Slayer</em> corps or a Yakuza organization. Performers take on surnames as inherited symbols of renowned rakugo lineages and compete for prestige in intense tournament arcs, ultimately facing the art form’s heavenly kings, who judge whether they can advance further. One such top king is Issho Arakawa, the man who expelled Akane’s father. It’s his looming presence that fuels Akane’s unyielding rise.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | Akane-banashi | VIZ" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E18XM9loxZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It’s not just me and former Kotaku writer Sisi Jiang who <a href="https://kotaku.com/shonen-jump-akane-banashi-one-piece-manga-evangelion-1849391135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sing praises for the series</a>. <em>Akane-banashi</em> has motion in manga and anime circles, with creatives like <a href="https://x.com/akanebanashi_PR/status/1531197181301968897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em>’s Eiichiro Oda</a> and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2022-08-01/evangelion-creator-hideaki-anno-recommends-akane-banashi-manga/.188234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno</a> recommending the series to their fans. However, the series’ latest developments, which subvert typical shonen tropes, have only made it all the more engrossing to read.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>Much like how <a href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-shippuden-anime-director-s-ocean-cut-filler-fan-1848765385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto Shippuden</em></a> reintroduced its orange knuckled-headed ninja with a time-skip and a sharpened resolve, <em>Akane-banashi</em> delivers a similar grand return. After an excursion overseas honing her craft in France, Akane returns to Japan—not as the bright-eyed ingénue we first met, but as a rakugo contender equipped with new techniques and a sharpened fire, all while carrying the quiet burden of fulfilling what her father couldn't. However, she’s no longer the talk of the town. Rakugo is a brutal “what-have-you-done-for-me-lately” stage, and the early chapters show her struggling under the pressure to regain her reputation, rhythm, and relevance.&nbsp;</p><p>I put the series aside for a couple of months, thinking <em>Akane-banashi</em> might stick to familiar beats—rivalries picking back up, theatrical power shifts in rankings, and Akane climbing the ladder as usual. But when I checked back in, I saw my manga daughter in the trenches.</p><figure><figcaption>(。﹏。*)<span></span><span>Shonen Jump</span></figcaption></figure><p>Akane’s comeback arrived with drama worthy of a shonen resurgence. She throws down the gauntlet against Karashi Nerimaya—the volatile “problem child” of rakuga—and Hikaru Koragi, the ragkugo world’s voice actor idol. These two, part of Akane-banashi’s in-universe Big Three, owe their rise to the bar Akane once set, pushing them to their limits to chase her rising star. When they compete in a tournament, Akane doesn’t just lose to them as the third-best in their trio; her performance sees her slide even further down the rakugo rankings, ranking fifth for the day. My GOAT is washed.&nbsp;</p><p>However, instead of celebrating their victory, Hikaru and Karashi confront Akane with a colder expression: disappointment. They don’t desire a hollow rival—they want her at her best self. The performer who once had the audience roaring is gone, replaced by this version filtered through the stern lens of her toxic new mentor, Issho, who forces her to perform without making audiences laugh (her signature rakugo style). She tried to fix this with an unconventional medley performance blending genres that, while impressive, didn’t wow audiences or judges like Hikaru and Karashi—two rakugokas who’ve become household names in Akane’s absence.</p><p>The manga’s brilliance lies in how it turns this niche theater tradition into a narrative engine. Its performers dissect each other’s creative choices, tweak genres, and chase emotionally cathartic payoffs to their tales. But they’re not just telling stories—they’re rewriting the rules of rakugo to get to their emotional climax.</p><p>And then there’s Akane, my manga daughter. She doesn’t walk back into this world to cheers. She reenters the rakugo world to scrutiny, doubt, and whispered what-happened-to-her’s as a has-been rakugoka instead of a returning star. It’s a reversal of the classic shonen hero’s homecoming. But instead of deflating her arc, it electrifies it.</p><figure><figcaption>This girl. She can do it. <span></span><span>Shonen Jump</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just when I felt an immense guilt for abandoning my girl in her time of need, Akane appears to have tapped into rakugo’s version of ultra instinct, declaring, “I’ve become only rakugo.” It’s a declaration that made me feel like the manga is teasing one of the most imposing comeback shonen victories for Akane in its ongoing tournament arc to rival that of a Saiyan’s <a href="https://ultradragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Zenkai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zenkai boost</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Akane-banashi</em> doesn’t just dramatize rakugo, it weaponizes it. Each character refines their delivery like a fighter adjusting their style through off-screen training or mid-performance improvisation, blending comedic, romantic, and dramatic styles to redefine what a solo performance can feel like. Whether it be its cast of comedians, actors, or wild-card upstarts, witnessing them morph their performances into slapstick routines, psychological thrillers, or heart-tugging romance—all while locked in a quiet rivalry to be crowned the new rakugoka legend makes <em>Akane-banashi</em> my favorite read on Shonen Jump.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TVアニメ『あかね噺』ティザーPV｜2026年放送決定！" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVmUVrYDGys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br>Watching Akane reclaim her space in a medium that lives and dies by audience response, pushing against etiquette and expectation, is nothing short of exhilarating. If Shonen Jump, like rakugo, is a stage where only one voice rules the room, <em>Akane-banashi</em> holds the floor every week. More folks should get in on the ground floor before it becomes passé to say you liked it before it became an anime.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven"><h3>Labubu To Lafufu: ‘See You In Court’</h3></a><p>Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven for allegedly selling fake Labubus in its stores</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-war-of-the-worlds-features-a-head-scratching-twist-2000636929">Amazon’s new <em>War of the Worlds</em> movie</a> starring Ice Cube and Eva Longoria was quietly released online last week and received universally negative reviews. Clips of the horrible sci-fi disaster flick, which is told entirely via a computer screen, have gone viral online. But one particular clip involving an Amazon delivery driver and a drone perfectly sums up how this latest iteration of the classic sci-fi story is less a movie and more a cheap branding exercise that doesn’t even hit 90 minutes.</p> <p>Released on July 30, <em>War of the Worlds</em> was <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/ice-cube-to-star-in-untitled-patrick-aiello-timur-bekmambetov-sci-fi-pic-for-universal-1234584529/">cooked up during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and tells the story of an alien invasion. But instead of following a group of characters through a dangerous and hostile invasion, you mostly watch Ice Cube struggle to act in front of a webcam for 80 minutes, not counting the credits and opening logos. Very late in the film, Ice Cube’s character needs a specific piece of code to shut down a powerful computer that the aliens are going after, and which the United States is willing to nuke to keep out of their Martian hands. The problem is that Ice Cube and a load of people, including his family, would be killed by the bomb. So a hacker sends him the code. But he has to put it on a USB thumb drive, which he somehow doesn’t have. Don’t worry, Ice Cube’s daughter has an idea. She downloads the code and loads it up on a USB drive, and then her boyfriend, who is an Amazon delivery driver, will use his Amazon Prime Air drone to deliver the USB device to Ice Cube and save the day. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hypercubexl.bsky.social/post/3lvgttjlv5s2h">Here’s the scene:</a></p>  <p>Yeah, you just watched an Amazon Prime ad shoved into this movie about an alien invasion. This honestly feels like a Super Bowl commercial more than a film. And here’s the wild thing: This isn’t the worst moment involving Amazon in the movie. A few minutes after this scene, the drone crashes and flips over near a homeless man living in a tent. This man is scared, as all around him are alien tripods destroying Earth. But our “heroes” need his help. So they use NSA tech to track down his phone number and text him to flip the drone over. He won’t risk his life to do it so they offer him a $1,000 Amazon gift card, pushing him over the edge and getting him to fulfill the deadly task. Gross shit!</p> <p>Anyway, <em>War of the Worlds</em> is barely a movie. More than half the runtime is just a view of a desktop PC and stock footage spliced into windows as if they’re security cameras or YouTube videos. It’s horrendous. It’s awful. And it’s exactly the kind of movie Amazon and other big corporations want to make. Movies that are barely movies, made for little money, starring people you might recognize, and filled with ads and product placement. This is our future. It sucks, huh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Aggro Crab, the developer of Another Crab's Treasure and the recently-released co-op survival climbing game Peak, took aim at a Roblox clone version of the latter in a Twitter/X post today, in which the studio said it would rather people pirate Peak than play "this microtransaction-riddled Roblox slop ripoff".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Roblox</a> slop ripoff <a href="https://t.co/ulRShLLGz2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ulRShLLGz2</a></p>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post in question</a> shows screenshots of a Roblox game called "Cliff", which does look suspiciously similar to Aggro Crab's Peak. Both games feature a round-headed protagonist whose goal is to climb a mountain at the center of an island, an activity that can be accomplished either alone or with friends. Cliff even calls out in its description that it's inspired by Peak!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though, "inspired" might be a bit generous. Take a look at the two game descriptions side-by-side. Here's Peak:</p><blockquote>PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom. Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it takes to reach the PEAK?<p>WORK TOGETHER</p></blockquote><blockquote>Need a Hand? You’ll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the mountain, which changes every single day. Help each other up ledges, or place ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is Cliff:</p><blockquote>⛰️CLIFF is a challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall. Trapped on a mysterious island, your only way to escape is to reach the top of the towering cliff. Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?</blockquote><blockquote>✋WORK TOGETHER</blockquote><blockquote>Need some help? You’ll have to rely on your friends if you want any chance of reaching the top. The mountain is tough, so help each other up ledges and watch out for dangers to make the climb easier for those who come after you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Woof, that's...the same? It's essentially just the same description copied wholesale with some swapped synonyms. And a comparison of the Badges for Cliff and the Steam Achievements for Peak reveals that Cliff also named its "Shore" and "Tropics" biomes directly after Peak's locations of the same names.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest material difference between the two games, apart from things like quality and scope, is that Cliff has microtransactions. You can buy certain items using Robux including a Climbing Pickaxe, a Parrot Friend, and a Starterpack. Peak doesn't have any such thing. It's $8 for the game itself, and that's it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is unfortunately a common phenomenon on Roblox. Plug the name of just about any game, AAA or indie, into Roblox's search feature and you'll find countless clones. On just a quick search I was able to find microtransaction-filled variations on Pokemon, Mario, Sonic, Undertale, Untitled Goose Game, Five Nights at Freddy's (woof, there are LOADS of those), Fortnite, Elden Ring, Stardew Valley, Celeste...I could go on. Some of these games are marketed as homages or fangames, but many just straight-up use stolen assets from the games they're based on, and others are pretty blatant clones trying to disguise themselves by changing some proper nouns around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Roblox's historical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">whack-a-mole approach to moderation</a> it's hard to say whether or not Aggro Crab's callout will have any effect on Cliff. But at least the studio has made its wishes known. Probably, the solution is just to buy Peak. But if you're so desperate you're going to play Cliff instead, the developers would prefer you engage in some piracy instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Developed by Strange Scaffold (creators of I Am Your Beast and Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3) in collaboration with Paramount Game Studios, the game mixes the strategic thinking of turn-based combat with the satisfying chaos of beat-’em-up action, bringing a refreshing edge to the franchise.</p><p>Set in a darker timeline where both Splinter and Shredder are dead, and the Turtles are on the brink of adulthood, Tactical Takedown tells a gritty coming-of-age story across 20 evolving, diorama-style levels. The game is driven by a genre-smashing soundtrack from award-winning composer RJ Lake, keeping battles intense and the energy high.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0prD_mVl45g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0prD_mVl45g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Launching alongside the console debut is the all-new Remix Mode, which will also be released as a free update for the existing PC version. Remix Mode doubles the enemy variety and introduces unique attack patterns that force players to rethink their strategies. Familiar foes become unpredictable, and survival means adapting on the fly, making every decision count more than ever.</p><p>For those who crave deep customization, Remix Mode also brings enhanced build crafting. As players face off against iconic enemies like the Foot Clan, they'll unlock skills, swap out gear, and build powerful loadouts for each Turtle. Whether you're mastering Michelangelo's speed or Donatello's tech-driven tactics, you decide the best way to take down the bad guys. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We’re in the first video game console generation where prices are going up instead of coming down. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-deal-discount-tariffs-xbox-switch-2-trump-1851778878">It’s rough out there</a>, especially if you were someone who was waiting on the sidelines for the right deal before finally buying a Nintendo Switch or upgrading to a PS5. But the good news is that even if <em>new</em> consoles keep getting more expensive, used versions have never been more affordable.</p> <p>If you asked me for the best deal in gaming right now, I’d probably say the Switch Lite. It arrived back in 2019 and as low-end dedicated gaming handhelds go, it performs decently well. Best of all, it has access to one of the best gaming libraries ever assembled. If you’ve never owned a Switch before, you can instantly start playing anything from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and<em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> to <em>Hades</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> on one of the most convenient form factors around. The only downside is that despite coming out six years ago, it’s never received a price cut. In fact, following Nintendo’s latest price hikes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">response to tariffs</a>, it’s now $230 to buy new.</p> <p>Used, however, you can get one in decent shape for just $100. According to reseller pricing data logged on <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-lite-gray">Price Charts</a>, that’s around the lowest it’s ever been, and prices don’t seem likely to spike again in the near future. It’s a similar story for the base model Switch with the blue and red Joy-Con. Recently raised to $340 new, you can get one for <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-with-blue-and-red-joy-con-version-2">less than half that used</a>. Prices for other older used consoles are also at all-time lows. A 1TB PS4 Slim hovers just above $100 right now. The cheapest Xbox One right now is just $98. Some of the newer consoles have decent used discounts as well.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614754">Price Charts / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Lets start with the Xbox Series S. It launched at $300, was frequently on sale for $250, and is now going for $380 new at GameStop. That’s nuts! The whole point of the Series S is that it can’t play discs or run games at 4K but it can give you convenient access to all of the great stuff that rotates through Game Pass. Used, however, the Series S remains a great bargain. While it once dipped down to as low as $160 in 2023, it’s still easy to find second-hand <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-s-console">for around $200</a>. That makes it the cheapest way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> when it comes to Xbox this month. <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-x-1tb-console">At around $375</a>, a used Xbox Series X is nearly double the price, but still way less than its current $600 MSRP.</p> <p>The PS5 is, surprisingly, an even better used deal than the Series X, probably in part because there’s way more of them floating around in the first place. Sony hasn’t raised the prices on its hardware in the U.S. yet and you can still grab one of the new <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 slim bundles for just $450. Used, the slim with a disc drive <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-slim-disc-edition">runs about $330</a>, while the all-digital base PS5 can be found <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-console-digital-version">for $300 or lower</a>. That’s only a third off the sticker price, but still not bad. At $70 each, that’s the same as buying both<em> Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> new this fall.</p> <p>There’s sometimes been a stigma around buying used consoles. GameStop refusing to price them competitively is part of that. You also don’t always know how well looked-after a system was. Has it been overheating from dust-clogged fans? <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470">Is it infested with bugs</a>? My personal experience with used consoles in the modern era has been quite positive, though. A used Xbox One I purchased in the mid aughts lasted me until I traded it in toward my Series S. A Switch I bought on Facebook last Christmas for just $200 (it also included <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and Switch Sports) still feels practically brand new.</p> <p>The only used console you can’t get a deal on right now is the Switch 2. Even pre-owned versions are going for over the current $450 MSRP. It’ll probably only get worse if and when Nintendo eventually raises that price as well. Fortunately, at least for now, most of the games worth playing on Switch 2 are still available on Switch 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s plenty of mobile games that make the most of their touchscreen input, but if you’re wanting to play action titles or stream something over Game Pass or Luna, you probably want a controller. Now, you can prop your phone up against something, and use a Bluetooth equipped controller like the official Xbox one, or the PS5’s DualSense, and it’ll work admirably well, but something like the GameSir X5 Lite Type-C is going to turn your phone into a perfect little portable, and it’s an ideal option if you’re looking for mobile gaming on a budget.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir X5 Lite — Wider. Lighter. Comfier. | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQuacraRpMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a clamp-style device, with two generous controller grips tethered by an expandable plastic backplate. In between the two controller portions is where you slot your phone, stretching the X5 Lite out and connecting it to your phone via the USB-C socket at one end. There’s a good deal of give here, and you can play with a range of phones or small tablets up to 213mm, so long as they’re equipped with USB Type-C. This means that even an iPad Mini can be slotted into place. There’s no alternative Bluetooth connection, so that’s it, but there is a USB-C port so you can also charge your device while playing. It’s worth noting that this isn’t capable of sending data though, in case you were looking for passthrough for other connections.</p>


<p>My Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was a perfect fit, and makes the unit look like a handheld console. It also feels rock-solid in your hand, and I had no worries about my phone falling out, or any part of the X5 feeling loose or weak. There’s a selection of rubber grips to make sure you phone is held in place as solidly as possible, but I had no problems with it after removing them entirely to ensure the easiest connection to my phone. It’s not the most attractive device I’ve ever seen, but the black plastic and straightforward, utilitarian looks get the job done.</p>


<p>Given the range of options on Android, from streaming, through native Android games, all the way to a bevy of retro console emulators, this is a great fit for someone who wants full control over their mobile gaming experience, with as little fuss, or extra steps as humanly possible. Slot your phone into the X5 Lite, and away you go.</p>
<p>I’ve done the majority of my testing of the GameSir X5 Lite with Amazon Luna, but it will, of course, work with any mobile titles that are setup for a real controller. That’s meant I’ve been able to dive into a bunch of classic titles that I’ve got squirreled away there, and I thought Watch Dogs 2 might be a fun fit with its stealth-based hacking action. Straight off the bat, the X5 Lite just glides into your hands, with two really comfortable moulded grips making it feel like a full-sized controller. It’s definitely simple and straightforward – there’s only the central inputs you’d expect, and no additional ‘pro’ styled buttons – but it immediately sets out its stall as a device you can spend a decent amount of time with.</p>
<p>Priced at £34.99 in the UK – though available for even less via platforms like AliExpress – the most surprising feature at this price point, and as the ‘Lite’ edition, is the inclusion of Hall Effect sticks. The stick tops are pretty small, so you do feel a slight reduction in grip and control, but the level of weight and tautness is excellent, and with the magnetic technology within, they shouldn’t develop stick drift even if you spend every waking hour playing Call of Duty Mobile.</p>

<p>You can feel the reduction in cost through the missing features – there’s no rumble – and the other inputs, though they all function perfectly well. The four main face buttons are quite tightly packed together, and they’ve been shrunk down to fit the X5’s smaller body, which may affect usability if you’ve got great big thumbs, or you just mash all your buttons at the same time. If your phone has powerful haptic feedback, you may not notice the X5’s lack of rumble, but I found that my Pixel 9 Pro XL just made a horrid buzzing sound whenever the haptics fired or a got a notification, so I made sure to turn it off when gaming.</p>
<p>The D-pad does a good job of getting you through menus, and a run through some classic platformers showed that it’s precise enough for some retro platforming. It wasn’t a great choice for Street Fighter 2 though, and proved too easy to slide off to reliably perform a Hadouken. Whether that’s a dealbreaker for you depends on the type of games you’re planning to play.</p>
<p>I do like the shoulder buttons, which feel nice and solid beneath your fingers, and respond well no matter where you press them, but the triggers are sadly less enjoyable to use, with digital, non-analogue inputs, and a horrible clacking noise with each activation. They’re easily the weakest part of the X5, and if you’re hoping to play a lot of FPS titles, then you might tire of them quite quickly.</p>

<p>GameSir have their own app, which gives you greater control over the X5 Lite and your mobile titles, helping you to update the controller’s firmware, perform input tests, and customise the controls, including altering your dead zones, and shifting between a Nintendo Switch style layout or an Xbox one. There’s three options for game control, with native support recognising the X5 immediately as an input, while hardware mapping and software mapping let you customise inputs if necessary too.</p>
<p>The GameSir app also has its own game library and discovery tool, recommending various titles from Apex Legends through to Genshin Impact, all of which work perfectly with the X5 Lite. It really is designed to make mobile gaming a more viable, and console-like experience, and at this price, it’s certainly worth considering.</p>

<p>It's Fortnite-ing time</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At last, the Power Rangers are making their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> debut later this week on 7th August.</p>
<p>There's been rumours about the Rangers dropping in the free-to-play battle royale for a while, and today's trailer confirms when <em>and</em> what to expect. They'll be landing in-game during Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock 'N Awesome. Oh, and did we mention that the trailer is incredible?</p>
<p>Featuring a blend of CGI and live action, we get an introduction to the Bad Bugs which Fortnite characters are battling in CGI. Then, the Red, Blue, and Yellow Rangers arrive and we get a cut to live action and a change in aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Butt rock music, over-the-top explosions and action, and martial arts-style stunts all accompanied by Peely; it's a little surreal to see the '90s era of Power Rangers alongside iconic Fortnite characters. But goodness, is this trailer great, especially if you grew up watching the show.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the Mighty Morphin Bundle will be hitting the in-game store, where you'll be able to unlock Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger, and Blue Ranger outfits and iconic accessories.</p>
<figure><a title="Power Rangers Fortnite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe5333a75949e/power-rangers-fortnite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're a Battle Pass holder, you'' also have access to a series of quests which kick off on 16th September; completing these will unlock the Dino Megazord outfit. Megazord will also be arriving mid-season for a takeover.</p>
<p>So it sounds like this is a no-brainer for Power Rangers fans, then. That trailer <em>might</em> have some of us downloading the game on Switch 2 right now; that version is pretty good, too!</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Power Rangers in Fortnite in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>When Harold Ryan, former Bungie CEO and president, formed his new studio <a href="https://www.probablymonsters.com/">ProbablyMonsters</a> in 2016, he remarked how that the aim was to transform how AAA games are developed, hoping to create a more sustainable environment for creators to, well, create in.</p>
<p>Now, the fledgling studio has announced its first two games, one of which is coming to Nintendo Switch. And indeed, it's <em>specifically</em> for Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a> is a side-scrolling roguelike that's due to hit Nintendo's console "this fall" and, as Ryan himself explains in the game's official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These games represent the first public expression of the approach we’ve been shaping behind the scenes...We’ve always believed there’s a better way to make games, one that supports original IP, empowers developers, and delivers memorable experiences to players. How we bring games to life has evolved. We’ve had to adapt, and these first two titles reflect a model that’s more focused, flexible, and sustainable. This is just the start, and we’re excited to finally share them with the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all sounds great, and Ryan also points out that, in order to fit the remit, Storm Lancers' run time comes in at a very manageable 10 hours. Music to our ears, to be quite honest.</p>
<p>A quick look around the <a href="https://www.probablymonsters.com/stormlancers/">game's official webpage</a> shows a cartoonish and very colourful-styled adventure that puts us in mind of a side-scrolling <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands</a> in a few of the screenshots, and the launch trailer, which you can see above, really does show off some very moreish looking two-player action.</p>
<p>Co-op is where it's at, and judging by how many upgrades and weapons we see in that brief launch trailer, folk who like tinkering their gear and setups before diving into co-operative runs, may well be in for a very good time. Here's some further info from ye olde PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storm Lancers is a rogue-like game inspired by 1980s anime and cartoons that features combo-focused fights and couch co-op. Led by industry veterans Jim Veevaert (Microsoft, Zynga) and Seth Thompson (Blizzard), Storm Lancers combines fluid combat with unstoppable momentum. Designed to keep the heart racing and reflexes sharpened, the game gives players a sense of adventure constantly on the move. Set in the world of Cryptica, players crash land on a living planet built around a powerful source of reality magic. As they traverse five ever-shifting biomes, each leap, slash, and dash propels them deeper into a vibrant world, only to be met by enemies that adapt to their every move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Storm Lancers can be played solo, the press release really is super keen to point out that it really is designed to shine in couch co-op where, "Two players can team up to explore the alien world together, developing complementary playstyles as they battle through merciless enemies and terrifying bosses.</p>
<p>Along the way, players collect items that transform and define their approach to combat, making each run unique and replayable." So, just like a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow, then.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some screenshots.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Leaks and rumors about the performance of the future PS6 console have significantly increased lately. Last Friday, YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> estimates of the PlayStation 6's rasterization performance, suggesting that it would be three times as fast as the base PlayStation 5, which would put it around the level of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080. Later, the same YouTuber <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the performance uplift during ray tracing operations will be much higher, between five and ten times as fast as the base PS5.</p>



<p>Now, though, AMD insider KeplerL2 has shared different predictions. <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270687172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to him</a>, the PS6 will be around the performance level of the AMD Radeon RX 9070XT, AMD's current flagship GPU. However, the next-generation Xbox will be slightly more powerful, with KeplerL2 comparing it to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5080. Both consoles will be powered by AMD's RDNA 5 architecture, which KeplerL2 reckons will be the largest architectural overhaul since the Graphics Core Next (GCN) era. Additionally, the insider said it will have even more features than NVIDIA's latest architecture, Blackwell; to prove that, the insider linked to several AMD patents:</p>

</ul>



<p>The comment around the next-generation Xbox is interesting because Moore's Law Is Dead has suggested that Microsoft's upcoming console (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powered by the Magnus APU</a>) would be less powerful than the PS6. Microsoft did <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise</a> its fans a year and a half ago that the next console would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever' seen in a hardware generation.</p>



<p>Considering these consoles are still two to three years out, we may have to wait a long time to get the official specs. That said, we'll keep reporting on credible leaks and rumors in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a massive fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a>, especially ones that are designed specifically for head-to-head or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play like 7 Wonders: Duel, Sky Team, and Splendor: Duel. These games tend to play faster than those with larger player counts, but still offer the juicy decision-making I crave. So when I heard about Zenith, a new tug-of-war-style dueling game set in space, I was immediately intrigued. Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes (making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing board game</a>). It checks all the boxes for me and has quickly become one of my favorite games to pull off the shelf.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="a30e96ef-17d6-47f2-88b0-73b35d89d8d4" id="225510"><div id="225510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zenith Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith manages to pack a lot of components into a relatively small box. Inside, you'll find three separate game boards (Planet, Technology, and Diplomacy), that connect together to create the main play area. The Technology boards are double-sided, allowing you to mix-and-match to create a randomized progression track before each game that players will need to adapt their strategy to match. Each player uses a set of wooden tech markers to track their progress during the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of small cardboard pieces to remove from the punchboards before you start, including three different credit denominations which function as the game's primary currency, bonus tokens, and the Leader badge. The rest of the components are made from high-quality recycled materials, including 80% wood, and all feature an etched design. They have a nice weight to them, and also smell great (who doesn't love the smell of fresh wood?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith's other currency, the aptly-named Zenithium, is represented by a set of yellow wooden tokens. Players primarily interact with each other during the game through the Influence disks that are placed on the Planet board. Each disk features a different color and etched design to represent one of the five planets you're vying for control over: Mercury, Venus, Terra, Mars, and Jupiter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in Zenith revolves around its deck of more than 90 unique Agent cards split across the three factions. Each Agent card includes a name and playful character artwork, many of which are subtle nods to famous sci-fi icons like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, Ray Bradbury, and George Lucas, just to name a few. I had a blast trying to figure out the dozens of references sprinkled throughout the deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the relatively short instruction manual, Zenith also includes two player reference cards that outline turn structure, as well as two double-sided aids that explain the myriad effects found on the Agent cards and Tech board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Zenith is a very straightforward game; the first player to take control of the senate wins. This can be achieved in one of three ways: controlling three of the same planet, controlling four unique planets, or controlling any five planets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You gain control of a planet when you have enough Influence, indicated by the colored disks on the Planet board. Each planet has a track with nine spaces: four on your side, four on your opponent's side, and one in the middle. Throughout the game, you and your opponent play cards and develop technology to move each of the five Influence disks back and forth across their corresponding tracks as you try to achieve one of the victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, players sit opposite one another with the Planet board in the middle. Three Tech boards are chosen at random (one for each faction) that connect to one side of the Planet board, with the Diplomacy board connecting to the other side. Each of boards has a distinct pattern on the bottom that ensures it's connected to the correct side of the Planet board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players randomly distribute the bonus tokens across the Planet and Tech boards, take 12 credits and one Zenithium, and draw four cards from the deck to make their starting hand. Because the hand sizes are small, you can mulligan any number of cards to give you the best possible start. Once players have finalized their hand, the game is ready to begin.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players take turns performing one of three actions during their turn: recruit an Agent, develop a technology, or become the Leader. To recruit an Agent, you play a card from your hand, paying for its cost in credits and applying the card's effects. Every card in the deck has a unique effect, and there is a <em>lot</em> of iconography to remember, so you'll likely be relying on the effect description aid quite a bit during your first few games. Each Agent card gains you at least one influence on the corresponding planet, which allows you to move the matching Influence disk towards your side of the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you recruit Agents, they are placed in a column below the corresponding planet. Each Agent that has been played provides a discount of one credit for future Agents of the same color. This light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> component incentivizes recruiting multiple Agents to the same planet and allows you to play more powerful Agents without disrupting your economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate action you can take during your turn is developing a technology, which is tracked on the Technology board. Each of the three Tech boards represent one of the game's three factions: Humans, Robots, and Animods, which are basically just anthropomorphic animals. Instead of recruiting an Agent (playing the card from your hand to gain influence), you can play the corresponding faction to its Tech track after paying the required cost in Zenithium. However, this resource can also be used to unlock powerful effects on certain cards, so you'll need to manage your reserves wisely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction's Tech track contains five spaces that increase in cost incrementally as you move up, while providing more powerful effects. The first space of each column only costs one Zenithium and has a relatively lackluster effect. But, each time you move up the Tech track, you'll get to perform every action below it when you move up to the next level. This makes the Technology board an important part of your strategy, as it can have game-altering effects as you reach the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, though, investing in the tech track can feel like a loss of momentum as it doesn't immediately help you gain Influence, so you'll need to balance this carefully as part of your strategy. While investing in a single faction's tech track has increasingly powerful rewards, investing in all three factions equally is another viable option as it provides you Influence when every faction reaches the next tier. The Tech board is an important part of the overall game and shouldn't be ignored, or you'll quickly lose ground to your opponent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last action you can choose to perform during your turn is becoming the Leader of a faction. By discarding a specific faction's card, you gain a one-time effect, as well as the Leader badge. Each faction has a different effect that helps improve your economy: Humans provide you with 4 credits, Robots give you one Zenithium, and Animods allow you to mobilize two cards (place two cards from the top of your deck under the corresponding planet without applying their effect).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Leader badge is important because it increases your hand size while holding it (the only way to do so), while also unlocking powerful bonus effects on some cards. This coveted component often makes for a mini tug-of-war game within the greater game as both players try to keep it in their control and reap its benefits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the strategy in Zenith boils down to carefully managing your resources. Between credits, Zenithium, your recruited Agents, and the cards in your hand, it's a delicate balance as you try to gain tempo over your opponent. Low on credits? You won't be able to play any Agents from your hand. Low on Zenithium? You progress on the Tech board is stalled until you manage to get some more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only aspect that you have little control over is the cards in your hand, as you always draw up to your hand size at the end of your turn and can't discard anything in your hand that isn't useful (with the exception of one Agent that allows you to dump your entire hand when played). While uncommon, there are moments where you can effectively brick while digging for a specific color card or faction. Most of the time it's the result of poorly mismanaging your resources, but when it happens it feels bad to watch your opponent gain momentum. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith features a high level of player interaction, but never manages to feel unfair. Many cards feature effects that disrupt your opponent's board state like Transfer, which allows you to move an Agent from your opponent's side of the board to the matching column on your side, or Exile, which lets you discard one of the Agents on your opponent's side. Investing in the various Tech tracks can allow you to take some credits or Zenithium, but they have a finite number of uses. While these effects can be annoying, one aspect about Zenith that I appreciate is that there's absolutely no way to disrupt your opponent's hand or outright drain their economy by playing cards. This creates a level playing field for both players and limits the amount of "bullying" that just feels bad in other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Zenith is designed for two players, there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">4-player</a> version that pits two teams against one another. While the rules are largely the same, teammates control their own hand of Agents that they can't discuss with one another, and can only recruit Agents on the three planets on their half of the board. When obtaining the Leader badge, that player can choose to give two cards to their teammate, but otherwise can't share any resources. It's an interesting twist on the standard game, but Zenith truly shines best at the intended two player count.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Zenith</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbkrE?object_uuid=ba928005-74cc-4887-a40f-c9a611e1b2fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DNR4VHPQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Two-Player Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 5, 2025 5:58 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Zenith is a strategic space duel for two where players fight over control of five planets by gaining the most influence. Throughout the game, players will play cards from their hand to recruit Agents with powerful effects, develop technology to swing the game in their favor, and appoint themselves Leader of one of three factions as they grapple for victory. It features a high level of strategic yet fair player interaction that challenges both players to carefully manage their resources, or risk losing tempo to their opponent. With meaningful decisions and tense tug-of-war gameplay packed into a brisk 30-minute experience, Zenith has quickly become one of my favorite two-player games to pull off the shelf.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenith-board-game-review-galactic-tug-of-war-for-two]]></content:encoded>

Resident Evil has a new ultimate adversary — Duolingo's dreaded Owl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Japan's official Resident Evil social media account has begun posting pictures of the Duolingo Owl terrorising Leon S. Kennedy in a warped version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-official-account-declares-the-duolingo-bird-its-new-biological-weapon-duolingo-responds-english-or-spanish/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, the Duolingo Owl — or a buff, supersized version of it — can be seen replacing the menacing Mr X in images that have more than a whiff of AI about them. "Our new biological weapon," the official Resident Evil account states, tagging in the official Duolingo Japan account. "Go. Spread language learning to the world."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up on the brandter, Duolingo Japan then replied with an image of the young Leon S. Kennedy pursued by its mascot, now wearing a Mr X-style hat. "Leon, you haven't done today's lesson, right?" the caption reads. Gulp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil then replied with an image of Leon using Duolingo to learn Spanish — a nod to the events of Resident Evil 4, which is set in rural Spain. The app even shows a lesson being set by one of the game's infected ganados. "Story of my life," reads the post's accompanying text.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concluding this bizarre saga, a final post from Duolingo Japan shows its mascot, again wearing Mr X's hat, reaching out while standing in front of the burning Raccoon City Police Department.  "I'll chase you anywhere until everyone can play Resident Evil in English," the post states. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">レオン、今日のレッスンやってないよね？ <a href="https://t.co/5JnHIiAxDQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/5JnHIiAxDQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/a0oj39YSnV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a0oj39YSnV</a></p>— Duolingo(デュオリンゴ) | 日本公式🇯🇵 (@Duolingo_Japan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Duolingo_Japan/status/1951598859018555415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">みんなが英語でバイオをプレイできるまで、どこでも追いかけるから <a href="https://t.co/ADgpeedEKs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/ADgpeedEKs</a> <a href="https://t.co/F0EmFim8X5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/F0EmFim8X5</a></p>— Duolingo(デュオリンゴ) | 日本公式🇯🇵 (@Duolingo_Japan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Duolingo_Japan/status/1951991448598884506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Why this is all happening is not clear — and Duolingo definitely did not exist back in 2004, when the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> took place.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby and the Forgotten Land's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade, Star-Crossed World, is dropping on August 28, but until now we didn't have very many details about what exactly the big update to Kirby's biggest adventure would entail. But a new trailer today has cleared up a lot of questions around the scope of this sparkly upgrade, including a look at what new enormous objects Kirby can fit in his ridiculous stretchy mouth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upgrade comes with the usual slate of performance improvements for the base game of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and yeah, dang, the original campaign sure looks smooth. But the meat of the upgrade is in the new Star-Crossed World content, which is unlockable once you've finished the first world of Forgotten Land's campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In it, a glittery meteor smashes into the Forgotten Land and transforms familiar levels into Starry Stages, where shimmering star pathways open up new areas and star fragments power up monsters into stronger versions of themselves. There are also new coins to collect, new figurines, and a new boss rush in the Colosseum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But really, it's the level changes that are the most exciting. While some of the shifts seem to be just interesting little branching paths in familiar places, other Starry Stages appear significantly transformed, including one level where waters part and you run around on the ocean floor. These stages also take advantage of three new Mouthful Mode transformations. In one, Kirby eats a spring and is able to bounce extremely high. In another, he eats a big gear and can roll around, including up and down and along walls, opening up a whole new dimension to movement. And in the third, Kirby can eat a big sign and slide down slopes really fast.</p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big takeaway from today's trailer is that Kirby and the Forgotten Land's Switch 2 upgrade seems like it's trying to earn its $20 upgrade price tag (or $80 full price, if you don't already own the Switch 1 version). When it was first announced, there were some concerns about how expensive the update would be relative to what players were getting out of it. But Star-Crossed World seems like a proper, full DLC for Kirby's first-ever 3D adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a well-deserved one, too. If you somehow skipped Forgotten Land first time around, the Switch 2 version seems like a good opportunity to revisit a game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">we gave an 8/10</a>, saying it "successfully warps the series’ classic mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

		<p>DreadXP and developer Cara Cadaver have announced that VILE: Exhumed is being released as a free shareware title, after the game got caught up in Steam’s mass banning of games due to payment processors refusing to allow people to buy certain games. It was banned for “sexual content with depictions of real people,” even though the game does not contain any of this. Instead, the game is about the developer’s own experience stalking and violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="VILE: EXHUMED | VILEISBANNED.COM" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6lOV2KN_Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cara Cadaver said,<em> “This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. This is our response to being censored, and our rejection of the idea that horror can be defined as acceptable or not.”</em></p>
<p><em>“As soon as we realized that the game had been banned, the conversation internally with Cara became about what we collectively could do to do right by her and her work. In the face of widespread attempted censorship, it didn’t feel like a time for half-measures and compromise, so we all decided that releasing the game into the wild where it could never be made unavailable by a single platform felt like the best option, and strongest message.”</em> said DreadXP Director, Hunter Bond.</p>

<p>VILE: Exhumed is available to purchase from the website <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">Vile Is Banned,</a> from where users can download the game for free or choose to donate funds. Cara has said that 50% of all profits will be donated to the charity Red Door Family Shelter, which is based in Toronto and helps families, refugees, and women who are getting out of violent situations.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-adds-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-rain-world-and-more.1262763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft announced the Game Pass lineup for August. The highlight of the lineup is undoubtedly Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will be available starting on Thursday, August 7.</p>



<p>The game, released in late 2023, was originally meant to be an expansion to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but Ubisoft later decided to make it a standalone title, albeit one that was not an open world action RPG like most of the latest titles in the franchise. Assassin's Creed Mirage was well-received by critics and fans. As to the former, here's an excerpt of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 8/10 review of the game</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>



<p>There are rumors that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be getting a DLC</a> funded by the Savvy Games Group, but there's no confirmation for the time being. Even if that turns out to be true, you'd have to pay it separately from the Game Pass addition.</p>



<p>Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage, the following games are being added to Microsoft's subscription service this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rain World (already available through Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>MechWarrior 5: Clans (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980">President Trump</a> was spotted earlier today wandering around on the roof of the White House. It wasn’t immediately clear why. He might have been surveying the nearby grounds for his proposed $200 million ballroom building that would be nearly twice the size of the White House itself. Or maybe the purported leader of the free world, having recently suffered a string of self-inflicted owns, was simply losing it.</p> <p>The latest sign we are deeply cooked as a nation came as the White House press pool berated the 79-year-old <a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-verdict-guilty-hush-money-trial-phoenix-wright-1851510635">convicted felon</a> with important questions ranging from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/donald-trump-mental-fitness">What are you doing up there?</a>” to “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/gaza-american-democracy-test/">Do you approve of Netanyahu taking over all of Gaza?</a>” At some point Trump was asked what he was trying to build. He tried to shout something incomprehensible about nuclear missiles in response. He pointed up at the sky. Welcome to the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>The contradictions continue to heighten. Who among us can turn away? Each new day presents the American people with some fresh and often morally abominable stupidity to leer at:</p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6YiAW1agsN">https://t.co/6YiAW1agsN</a> <a href="https://t.co/k099T14SIs">pic.twitter.com/k099T14SIs</a></p> <p>— Jéferfon Menezes (@JefinhoMenes) <a href="https://twitter.com/JefinhoMenes/status/1952751166577623068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>          <p>It’s possible the rooftop stroll is evidence of a man losing his grip not just on reality but on his poll numbers too. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/polling-tariffs-trump-analysis">Trump’s agenda</a>–lawless ICE arrests, tax cuts for the rich, tariffs for everyone else–is underwater with nearly every slice of the public. The Epstein files remain MIA even as questions mount, much to his base’s disbelief. Amid all this winning is one crazy gambit after another, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/04/nasa-china-space-station-duffy-directives-00492172">including building a nuclear reactor on the moon</a>.</p> <p>Where will Trump pop up next? Will he return to the golf course to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-golf-score-cheating-bedminster-b2801223.html">get creative again</a> with his sandtrap ball placement? Will he go back to a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/trump-pennsylvania-mcdonalds-visit/">marveling at the fry grill at McDonalds</a>? He has a Twitch streamer’s knack for marrying the faux-improv of manufactured reality TV with genuinely unpredictable WTF moments. Pay no attention to the fact that the price of things like ground beef (and the original Switch) <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112">just hit record highs</a>.</p>
