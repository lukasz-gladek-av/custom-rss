<p>No twist of fate</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the big hour-long Nintendo Direct, Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> got a release date for Switch 2! And it's landing on the console on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The game was revealed back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/capcoms-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-for-switch-2">July's Partner Showcase</a> and has received a huge glow-up from its lovely-looking predecessors. But this is more of that charming turn-based Monster Hunter action we've seen on 3DS and Switch.</p>
<p>In the brand new trailer, there's a revelation: twin monsters are "a portent of disaster" and we've got twin Rathalos(es?) on our hands. One of them is yours and you'll be riding them around the world as you tame Monsties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While new details are sparse, we do have a rundown of the game from its Steam page, so check that out if you need a refresher:</p>
<p>Embark on a new adventure in the third installment of the turn-based RPG series set in the world of Monster Hunter! Become a Rider in the Monster Hunter Stories series as you hatch and build kinship with friendly monsters known as Monsties, then explore and battle alongside them in a world full of potential!</p>
<p>Set two centuries after a conflict that divided neighboring kingdoms, the drums of war are reignited as twin Rathalos‚Äîlong thought extinct‚Äîhatch from a single egg: an omen of destruction.</p>
<p>Two kingdoms, two Riders, and two Rathalos; their fates now intertwined. As calamity encroaches, seek hope beyond the border and into forbidden lands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 is coming to Switch 2 in March 2026 ‚Äî ready to ride Rathalos into the skies? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New information has surfaced in the federal investigation into the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk that includes a potentially <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251">unexpected link to <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. Bullets left behind near the crime scene had markings on them, according to information shared at a news conference on Friday morning by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, one of which included symbols that line up with a military Stratagem from last year‚Äôs hit sci-fi extraction game.</p> <p>Investigators said Discord messages from the suspected shooter led them to believe he had engraved the writings on bullets he used to kill Kirk at a Utah Valley University event earlier this week. A bolt-action rifle with a scope was recovered from a wooded area near the school on Thursday, with unfired bullets containing engravings on the casings.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö®Spencer Cox confirms writings on bullet casings and says they included "hey, fascist" and "if you read this, you are gay LMAO." <a href="https://t.co/9gow1IhynD">pic.twitter.com/9gow1IhynD</a></p> <p>‚Äî Off The Press (@OffThePress1) <a href="https://twitter.com/OffThePress1/status/1966506342039900267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One of the casings reportedly had the words ‚ÄúHey fascists! Catch!‚Äù on it alongside an up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrows.</p> <p>While that last part might seem meaningless to most people, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players immediately understood it to be a reference to the <a title="Eagle 500kg Bomb" href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">Eagle 500kg Bomb</a> stratagem which requires players to input those button presses on their keyboard or their controller‚Äôs d-pad in order to call down a giant payload that explodes moments later.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚áß‚á®‚á©‚á©‚á© (Up, Right, Down, Down, Down) is an orbital stratagem code from the game Helldivers II. It calls in an Eagle airstrike that drops a 500K bomb ‚Äî the most destructive piece of single ordinance in the game. <a href="https://t.co/GzMvH9Dxrj">https://t.co/GzMvH9Dxrj</a> <a href="https://t.co/7M2nfvQFGJ">pic.twitter.com/7M2nfvQFGJ</a></p> <p>‚Äî Steve Skojec (@SteveSkojec) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSkojec/status/1966514346390962483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It‚Äôs not yet clear if the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, who was recently arrested in connection with the assassination, meant for the engraving to be connected to <em>Helldivers 2</em> or what significance that reference would have had in connection with the crime.</p> <h2>What is <em>Helldivers 2</em>?</h2> <p><em>Helldivers 2</em> was made by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Sony for PlayStation 5 and PC early last year, instantly becoming one of 2025‚Äôs most popular games after selling over 10 million copies. The multiplayer shooter has players step into the shoes of space marines as they battle alien threats across the galaxy as a parody of sci-fi fascism in the vein of <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p> <p>Players have been flooding the game‚Äôs Discord today following the press conference sharing their shock and disgust, as well as debating whether Arrowhead Game Studios should make a statement addressing the situation. Robinson‚Äôs name has already been banned from the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord servers so that any attempt to mention the suspected shooter by name is automatically filtered out.</p> <p>Politicians have long tried to link gun violence with video games, including President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his department was looking into any potential links between gaming and increases in school shootings. The U.S. suffers from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd">exponentially more school shootings</a> than other countries, despite having the same number of video games.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a rather unexpected Pok√©mon spin-off, Pokopia. Revealed during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-nintendos-latest-direct">12th September Nintendo Direct</a>, the new game is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> in 2026 and is being developed by Koei Tecmo Games.</p>
<p>In the game players are tasked with creating their own Pok√©mon paradise, with Ditto as the protagonist - albeit Ditto taking on a human-like appearance.</p>

<blockquote><p>About Pok√©mon Pokopia</p>
<p>As Ditto, players can explore and learn moves from the Pok√©mon they befriend‚Äîsuch as Bulbasaur's Leafage to grow greenery, or Squirtle‚Äôs Water Gun to revive dried-up plants‚Äîexpanding their capabilities and helping them create an inviting environment to attract a variety of Pok√©mon.</p>
<p>Players can collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pok√©mon, allowing them to experience a cozy, slow life with Pok√©mon‚Äîone that they build themselves from the ground up. Over time, players can develop a town of their own and invite other players or Pok√©mon to visit. Pok√©mon Pokopia also features a day-night cycle linked to real-world time, changing weather, and in-game locations with their own unique characteristics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Koei Tecmo has dabbled in this sort of title before, providing much of the work for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, another Minecraft-esque spin-off of a major Japanese RPG series. It could be that some of the development talent is shared between these titles - though as with most Pokemon games, Game Freak is also clearly deeply involved.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/balatro-update-1-1-will-not-be-ready-this-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-update-1-1-will-not-be-ready-this-year.1296543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer LocalThunk has announced that the 1.1 update for Balatro will not be ready for 2025, and there is no new specific release window for when it will be ready. In a blog post, LocalThunk said the release timing is being moved a to a done when it is done approach, so there is no pressure to meet a public deadline. You can read the full blog post from LocalThunk below.</p>
<p><em>I have some unfortunate news: The promised 2025 Balatro 1.1 update isn‚Äôt going to come out in 2025. I know, I announced that it would, but it has become clear now that it won‚Äôt happen by the end of the year and I wanted to tell you all now. I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry.</em></p>


<p><em>The truth is that I probably shouldn‚Äôt have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all. I‚Äôm a hobbyist developer at heart and I love to tinker. If you read my blog post about the Balatro timeline, you‚Äôll know that since the game went public in the summer of 2023 I have become all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development. The struggles of pre-launch are detailed in that blog post, but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt stop at launch. Immediately after Balatro 1.0 came out in February 2024 I dove right in to a big balance patch (1.0.1), then into the mobile port of the game right after, and by the time the mobile version came out in late 2024 I was well and truly burned out.</em></p>
<p><em>I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work. However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it‚Äôs a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch.</em></p>
<p><em>I still love drawing my silly jokers, I carry around a notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game, and thankfully I still consider this my hobby, but the prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible.</em></p>

<p><em>I am working slowly, but I like it that way. I love getting sucked into rabbit holes and I don‚Äôt like trying to force things creatively. I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realize how important that is for my process. I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of ‚Äúwork‚Äù for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don‚Äôt want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets.</em></p>
<p><em>So I‚Äôm apologizing here, now, to you. I won‚Äôt be making the 2025 deadline I said I would. Balatro 1.1 will still come out, of that I am certain, but the new timeline is going to be it‚Äôs done when it‚Äôs done. It will be a free update for everyone on all platforms when it‚Äôs ready, and it‚Äôll probably need some adjustments when it‚Äôs out there in the world (like 1.0 did), but that won‚Äôt be this year.</em></p>
<p><em>I posted a few months ago that I finally got 100% of the achievements in Balatro, and for a bit of reassurance, the Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game. I‚Äôm already super excited to try and 100% the game all over again from a second profile when 1.1 is ready. Rest assured, it will happen.</em></p>

<p>Another free upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the gift that just keeps on giving ‚Äî just a few weeks after ConcernedApe announced it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">working on a 1.7 update</a>, today's Nintendo Direct also unveiled a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the beloved farming sim.</p>
<p>And of course, the upgrade is 100% free too. Plus, it includes Mouse Mode controls, which will make decorating your house and farm <em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition isn't just about the mouse, though. Four-player split-screen multiplayer and eight-player online multiplayer is also coming.</p>
<p><em>And</em> just in case you still didn't think Stardew was great value, you can now use GameShare to play with up to up to three others if they don't have the game. And yes, it works with Switch 1 and Switch 2. That's pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley is already one of the best games on Switch, and it's easily one of the best farm sims of all time. We can't wait to lose our life to this again on Switch 2. It might be time for a new co-op farm...</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to the Switch 2 Edition in the comments</em>.</p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>it's not even out yet, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</a> is <em>already</em> getting DLC, and it was announced during today's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension</a> doesn't have a release date yet, but it looks to focus on the Pok√©mon Hoopa and features two brand new Mega Evolutions for Raichu ‚Äî Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.</p>
<p>Hoopa is apparently opening up dimensions across Lumiose City. What that means for our intrepid trainer? No idea, but we bet we'll get hoop-ing (sorry) in to find out.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Z-A news we got today. Just before that, we got <a href="https://youtu.be/PPTqA10lt-c?si=Wl_17ewBg7a7QQF0">a little peek at three new Mega Evolutions</a>, and they're for the Kalos Starter Trio.</p>
<p>Yep, Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja are all getting their own Mega. <em>Finally</em><em>.</em> You'll need to earn a Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite via the Z-A Battle Club in order to see them, but they're excellent evolutions of their original class-based designs.</p>
<p>However, the kicker is that they're only available via <em>online</em> Ranked Battles. According to the press release, "Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite stones cannot normally be obtained during regular gameplay. Mega Stones obtainable as promotion rewards are planned to be redistributed in future seasons." So that's a bit of a bummer.</p>

<p>We've already seen a brand new Mega Evolution in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pokemon-legends-z-a-unveils-a-newly-discovered-mega-evolution">Mega Malamar earlier this week</a>, so with this batch of five newbies, we're swimming in new battle opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of these new Megas in the comments below!</em></p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection was <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">first announced this past July</a>, with a release window set for 2026. Today, during the hour-long <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Capcom confirmed that the latest entry in the Monster Hunter Stories series will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this coming March 13, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer showcased today delved more into the game's story and showed off some more gameplay for the upcoming title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection ‚Äì Release Date Trailer ‚Äì Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIVgJyceMZI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3's narrative is kicked off with the birth of Twin Ratholos' with players stepping into the role of the heir to Azuria. "<em>Ride, befriend, raise, and battle with monsters in a vibrant and expansive world filled with a colorful cast of characters</em>," reads the video's description for the trailer. </p>



<p>The game will focus on the divide between two nations, with the birth of the two Ratholos' bringing both a sense of hope and terror, as they could either be part of the solution to the nations not destroying each other, or be the key to that dreaded destruction.</p>



<p>The last Monster Hunter Stories title surpassed <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">2 million units sold</a> as of June 2024, and this follow-up will surely be another strong seller in Capcom's portfolio of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">Monster Hunter games</a> that have been selling like gangbusters. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6, and the next major update for the turn-based gacha RPG is landing later this month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, Version 3.6 will be arriving on September 24th, and it'll be bringing two playable characters with it, as well as a new high-difficulty challenge and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can, of course, expect new story content in this&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update. HoYoverse says that the world of Amphoreus "stands at a crossroads", and that Miss Evernight (who's also joining the roster as a playable character) will be unveiling her plan to save the world, which "diverges from the prevailing creed of salvation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.6-release-date-evernight.jpg?itok=DkZYlyPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.6-release-date-evernight.jpg?itok=akkEmXwy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6 brings new characters and more later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, you're getting two new playable characters into the bargain with this update. The first is the aforementioned Everwild, who joins as a 5-star Ice fighter. She can summon a sprite to help her accumulate extra damage, then deal that damage as soon as the stack is full. Her Ultimate, meanwhile, deals extra damage and sets her up for even more buffs.</p>

<p>Your second playable character for this update is the rather improbably-named Dan Heng ‚Ä¢ Permansor Terrae, who can buff his team by shielding them, but don't worry; he can also deal his own damage and hold his own in a fight.</p>

<p>Until the end of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 4.0, you can also claim Dan Heng ‚Ä¢ Permansor Terrae for free simply by logging into the game. He's a five-star character, too, so he's no slouch, and he should be a solid addition to your team.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6 launches across all platforms on September 24th. The game is <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this one!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>'s free 1.1 update won't release in 2025 as originally planned, developer Localthunk has announced. There's no new release date, but they say the update'll arrive when they've been able to complete it, while continuing to work at a healthy pace.</p>
<p>This update was first announced by publishers Playstack in August last year, with Localthunk subsequently revealing in a chat with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next">Bloomberg</a> that it'll feature, among other stuff, some new jokers and a revamp of the Matador card. The latter dishes out a cash boost whenever you play a hand that triggers a boss blind's ability.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">blog post</a> about the decision to delay the update, Localthunk wrote that it all comes down to wanting to ensure they keep on taking care of their health and desire to keep on developing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder in the way they work, as you can read below:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is that I probably shouldn‚Äôt have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all. I‚Äôm a hobbyist developer at heart and I love to tinker. If you read my blog post about the Balatro timeline, you‚Äôll know that since the game went public in the summer of 2023 I have become all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development. The struggles of pre-launch are detailed in that blog post, but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt stop at launch. Immediately after Balatro 1.0 came out in February 2024 I dove right in to a big balance patch (1.0.1), then into the mobile port of the game right after, and by the time the mobile version came out in late 2024 I was well and truly burned out.</p>
<p>I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work. However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it‚Äôs a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, they now plan to keep on working at that slower cadence. "Balatro 1.1 will still come out, of that I am certain, but the new timeline is going to be it‚Äôs done when it‚Äôs done," the developer explained, "It will be a free update for everyone on all platforms when it‚Äôs ready, and it‚Äôll probably need some adjustments when it‚Äôs out there in the world (like 1.0 did), but that won‚Äôt be this year."</p><p>I'm glad to see Localthunk putting their health and happiness above all else. After all, given that Balatro's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">well-earned</a> (not just because it led Edwin to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-mod-jimbos-big-naturals-is-a-lot-funnier-and-safer-for-work-than-it-sounds">have to write about boobs</a>) and rampant popularity isn't going to evaporate into nothingness anytime soon, there's no sense in trying to rush 1.1 out. Folks will still be here for it further down the line, and ready to whip out their decks the moment it drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all know that storage is a hot commodity. Whether it‚Äôs managing to have enough space on your phone to record new videos and photos or having enough room on your PC or gaming console to download an upcoming title, there never seems to be enough room. That‚Äôs why when stuff like SSDs, external storage, or MicroSDs go on sale, you pick them up.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/"> Right now, the Samsung EVO Select series of memory cards are on sale, going for as much as 26% off.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 128GB, normally $17, is several bucks off down to $13. The 256GB option is down from $26 to just $20. The 512GB MicroSD has been cut from $44 to $35 and the full 1TB option has dropped from $87 to just $75.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Give Your Switch Room to Breathe</h2>
<p>For gamers, you can put this in your Nintendo Switch to manage both save data and the storage of the digital games themselves. The launch Nintendo Switch only comes with a measly 32GB. Now thankfully most Nintendo games aren‚Äôt too big by comparison to Xbox, PlayStation, and third-party AAA titles. Some of those shoot into the triple digits of gigs. One of Nintendo‚Äôs largest games,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, is only 18.2GB. But still, that‚Äôs more than half your console‚Äôs storage.</p>
<p>Pop in the 1TB Samsung EVO Select for just $75 and you won‚Äôt ever have to worry about game storage on your Switch again.</p>



<p>Important to note: These MicroSD cards are not compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires MicroSD Express cards which are faster at reading and writing data. Inserting one of the Samsung EVO Select MicroSD cards into a Nintendo Switch 2 console will not allow you to save or load neither your save data nor any digital games. It is still compatible with the original Nintendo Switch console along with the Nintendo Switch Lite and Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select MicroSDs have a read and write speed of up to 160MB/s. While not enough for the Switch 2, Nintendo only recommends speeds of up to 90 MB/s on its predecessor anyway so this will have no problem with the OG Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/">While the price is still down, you can at least quadruple your Nintendo Switch‚Äôs storage for as low as $13.</a> That‚Äôs a hell of a deal.

During our chat, we learned about how the team is supporting console players with everything from crossplay to performance and fidelity modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned about how the studio has implemented anti-cheat measures for next month‚Äôs Battlefield sequel. The conversation saw Buhl acknowledge that, while it will be hard to guarantee a cheat-free environment for those playing with the Battlefield 6 PC pool, Ripple Effect and the rest of the BF Studios team have gone to great lengths to fight off cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúSo, we're doing a lot on the PC side to clamp down on cheating as much as possible,‚Äù Buhl said. ‚ÄúWe have a whole team within Battlefield dedicated to anti-cheat, which includes engineers, analysts who are reviewing things and banning players, and figuring out what the latest cheats are. We have another whole dedicated team at EA to anti-cheat that we work closely with.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buhl also highlights the new Battlefield 6 anti-cheat system, Javelin, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-really-sucks-battlefield-6-developer-dice-knows-anti-cheat-measures-like-secure-boot-mean-some-pc-gamers-just-wont-be-able-to-play-the-game"><u>the divisive secure boot</u></a>, as other important components in their strategy. Still, as cheaters continue to run amok across the most popular multiplayer games on the market, Ripple Effect knows some will slip through the cracks, especially on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúNow, we can never win against cheaters, right?‚Äù Buhl added. ‚ÄúCheaters will always be there. It's a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. I can't promise that there will be zero cheaters if you're playing against PC players. That's just simply not possible, but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive. We see this as critical to the success of ‚Äî to the health of ‚Äî the game.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 has a release date of October 10, 2025, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, but cheaters were able to infiltrate servers months early. EA held open beta periods throughout August, allowing players to get a pre-release taste of the Battlefield experience BF Studios has been cooking up for the last few years. It also saw players come <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement"><u>face-to-face with cheaters</u></a> despite the development team‚Äôs efforts, with EA reporting it prevented 330,000 cheat attempts by August 8, just one day after open beta early access began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nickerson said crossplay will be on by default when a player loads into Battlefield 6 for the first time, something players should know if they‚Äôre especially worried about encountering cheaters on PC. Console users who turn off crossplay will limit their pools to the PlayStation and Xbox communities, but Ripple Effect is hoping it won‚Äôt come to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúYou don't want to play a game and feel like a bunch of people on the other side are cheating,‚Äù Buhl added. ‚ÄúI hope console players feel confident enough in what we're doing for cheating on the PC side that they don't feel like they want to turn crossplay off just for that reason. If they do want to, that is an available option for them, but we think it's super important for PC and console players to be confident that most of the people that they're playing with or against are not cheating, and we're putting a huge amount of effort into that.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see Buhl and Nickerson explain some of the other ways BF Studios is prepping for the launch of Battlefield 6 in our full interview.

Movie titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs confirmation that arrives after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-movie-sequel-domain-names-spotted-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">rumors swept the internet</a> yesterday, revealing that Nintendo will indeed be partnering up with the Minions movie studio yet again to create a movie adaptation of the classic 2007 Wii platformer. It‚Äôs slated to arrive in the U.S. April 3, 2026, and in Japan April 24, 2026, with its first trailer revealing a small amount of footage before showing off its official title and logo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement also revealed some of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie's cast. It's a lineup that focuses on returning names that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, with Chris Pratt back as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy back as Princess Peach, Charlie Day back as Luigi, Jack Black back as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key back as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson back as Kamek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has a lot of potential for newcomers to the cast, too. Who will play Rosalina is likely the question on the minds of most fans, as the storytelling icon first made her debut in the original 2007 game but didn't show up for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The last film also teased a potential appearance from Yoshi, though it's unclear if Mario's dinosaur companion will have any speaking lines when or if he eventually appears.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Teaser Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is out in just about seven months.
