<section><p>The game's director said he's been dreaming of making a game like this since he was a child.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There were all kinds of games on display at Summer Game Fest 2025: scary games, thrilling games, funny games, but only one game was making everyone cry. I played a demo of the game alongside the developers, and I won't pretend otherwise: It messed me up, too. The incredibly moving experience came from my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/out-of-words/" data-ref-id="5000-681510">Out of Words</a>, the debut from the creative team of Kong Orange and WiredFly. In speaking with the team, I was incredibly moved by their emotional maturity and thoughtfulness. Out of Words is an adorable co-op puzzle-platformer, but more than that, it's an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am a bit of a romantic," game director Johan Oettinger told me, describing the relationship between the game's playable characters, Karla and Kurt. Typically, "they can talk about anything. But they find themselves in a moment in their relationship with something new in the air." But sadly, Oettinger added, "they can't find the words" to say how they feel. Out of Words is a coming-of-age love story about the things we want to say but don't know how.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzA43ZQJ3Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzA43ZQJ3Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Something is in the way of them being honest with each other, and that premise, combined with Oettinger's soft-spoken way of speaking about this game he clearly loves so much, was already getting me pretty misty before I even played. It was like I'd walked into a poetry reading where, by chance, a demo of a gorgeous, stop-motion animated video game was also taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love stop-motion," Oettinger told me, admitting it's like the "extreme sport of animation" due to how unforgiving it is. He explained to me that creating this game had been his dream since he was 11 years old, when he played The Neverhood, a 1996 stop-motion animated game developed in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg's Dreamworks. "All the cinematics [of Out of Words] are fully stop-motion, animated frame by frame in front of a camera. And everything in the world is also handcrafted. Every element you see, every picture you see, has literally been touched by a human being. The grass, the strings are cut out of paper with scissors. The little cliffs and surfaces and books are cut up and 3D-scanned, the surface of the water is cellophane, and so on."</p><p dir="ltr">As players explore the world, searching for the words to say what they need to say, they'll come to find the true antagonist: "doubt itself," as Oettinger put it. The mechanics of the game will change often to reflect the story. In a portion I played, Kurt and Karla had to learn to trust each other, sharing possession of a light that would help them float above gaps. At first we stumbled, vanishing into pits of darkness with every mistake. But soon, we were able to pass the light back and forth with dance-like chemistry, catching each other with well-choreographed trust falls. Whatever shape the gameplay takes as the story goes on, it's meant to be approachable for players of all skill levels. "The dream is that you're able to play with your child, or your non-gamer partner, your non-gamer parents, take them on this journey with you," game design lead Jeff Sparks told me.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Morten Søndergaard, the game's poet--yes, that's his actual job title--met Oettinger in 2012, and the pair bonded over similar experiences and a shared vision. "I always wanted to make language something tangible," Søndergaard said. "I'm a little dyslexic, actually, and so I keep bumping into language. Language is something that bumps into me, and I bump into it. Meeting Johann and starting the work on Out of Words was a dream come true, to be able to be <em>in </em>language. [Karla and Kurt] are in language. And so they are going <em>through </em>language. And I think language is a trust system in a way, and language is also a game. Language is something we play with, 'play on words' and all that. So, it all comes together in this symphony of emotion."</p><p dir="ltr">"When Martin came to me with the idea of, 'Wouldn't it be cool to fall <em>into </em>language?' I fell in love, not only with Morton, but also with that idea," Oettinger added, "because I am dyslexic myself, and we've combined this with my love of coming-of-age and stop-motion, and it turned into the game I've been dreaming about making. I want to make something that, if I found this as an 11-year-old dyslexic boy, it could just show me, 'Okay, this is how language can be. It's not something a belittling teacher is trying to push into you.' Then I would have discovered so many things I love much earlier, and it would have opened my world. I could say to my mother, 'Look, mom, let's play this together. This is why I love games.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The room was getting weepy by this point, and the team had told me crying had been a running theme of Summer Game Fest in the Out of Words booth. Oettinger shared a touching example from earlier in the day where he was explaining the game to a translator who would then translate his words into Japanese for their colleague, and the translator couldn't help but cry as they reshaped the words, which to me seemed sweetly similar to what the game is trying to do itself; through this transformation came raw emotion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361"></a><figcaption>Out of Words has been in development for years, but the game's director told GameSpot it's actually been his dream to make this game for most of his life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everyone was being so sincere and vulnerable, and it was quite unlike any video game demo I've ever been a part of, to be totally forthcoming. I believe emotional vulnerability is the purest form of beauty. When people, especially two people together, can open themselves up to potentially be hurt but are instead rewarded for their honesty with the other person's empathy and acceptance, it's one of the most extraordinary things that can happen to us as human beings. I'm elated to see a game taking on this idea with such a delicate hand and artful eye. Suffice it to say, by the time my 40 minutes with the team was nearing its end, I knew it would go down as one of my favorite experiences I've had in my career.</p><p dir="ltr">"Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience. I mean, the moment there," Oettinger said, pointing to an image of the main characters, "I think we all have our story of that moment where we can't find the words. And in my case, a girl is standing there in front of me, and Karla is, of course, based on that girl from when I was that age, Sarah, and maybe that's a little Johan," he hinted, "and I lost her. She was my best friend. In that moment where I couldn't find the words, what if I could fix the inner language, and then I could say what I wanted?"</p><p dir="ltr">Out of Words comes out in 2026 on Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Co-op will be playable locally or online with cross-play, making it easy to bring the Kurt or Karla from your own life into the game with you.</p>

            <p>The team at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> studio Build A Rocket Boy is "heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended," it has said, promising more fixes throughout June.</p>
<p>MindsEye released earlier this week, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>. Build A Rocket Boy released a statement yesterday, when it said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">would be prioritising gameplay performance with an update</a>.</p>
<p>"Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak," the developer has since shared on the MindsEye Discord, adding roughly one in 10 players were impacted.</p>

<p>"We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox," it continued, stating the team is "fully committed to ensuring all players have a great experience".</p>

<p>MindsEye has had an unusual lead up to launch, it has to be said. At the end of May, the studio's co-CEO suggested the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio"> game's negative reaction up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the developer</a>.

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">the studio's Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer left the company</a>, just one week before MindsEye released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Suikoden STAR LEAP, the first canon entry in the series in a very long time, is launching on PC as well as on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>During today's Press Start showcase, Konami confirmed the next entry in the role-playing game series, which returned to the spotlight earlier this year with the launch of a remaster of the first two games released on PlayStation decades ago, is launching on Steam as well as on mobile platforms. Besides confirming the game's Steam release, Konami also shared a brand new trailer providing more information on the story set a few years before the events of the original Suikoden and only a few years after Suikoden V, the latest main entry in the series. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=978&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Suikoden STAR LEAP was officially announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-revival-continues-with-new-canon-mobile-game-animated-series/">March</a> as a new mobile entry in the series. Besides sporting beautiful 2D graphics over 3D backgrounds inspired by the first entries in the series, the game will also see the return of plenty of fan-favorite characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa. While characters from all over the series will be available via a gacha system, Suikoden STAR LEAP will also feature 108 Stars of Destiny that can be recruited without engaging in gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Suikoden I &amp; II: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars is the latest entry in the series, and is now available on PC and consoles. You can learn more about the remasters of two of the best JRPGs released on the original PlayStation by checking out my&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-review-an-enduring-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

Mode director Yu Sahara, who’s worked on <em>Metal Gear </em>in the past, distinguished it from <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, a multiplayer spin-off of <em>Metal Gear Solid 4 </em>that featured tactical stealth takes on traditional scenarios like team deathmatch and capture the flag.</p><p>“The landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot,” he said during the livestream. Indeed it has, but the most appealing about Metal Gear getting multiplayer again is how old-school it might end up feeling compared to the current glut of extraction shooters, battle royales,and battle passes. Here’s a quick teaser from the showcase:</p><p>Instead of bringing that back, Sahara and the team at Konami worked on updating what <em>Metal Gear Online </em>might look like decades later. The focus will still be on camouflage and staying hidden before choosing the right time to go after an objective or surprise an opponent, and footage in a brief teaser showed characters getting into what look like small D-Walker-type mechs on the battlefield. Also lots of operatives crawling around in leaf shrouds. </p><p>Konami didn’t have anything else to reveal about the mode other than it will be arriving with the rest of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> at launch on August 28. In addition to Fox Hunt, the remake also features a Snake vs. Bomberman mode and one where he has to round-up monkeys from Ape Escape. Despite the new content, however, much of the base game appears to be an exceedingly faithful retread of the 2000s-era stealth thriller, just with modern controls and other tweaks to make it more approachable for new audiences. The original is still available to play as part of the <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em> released back in 2023. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the Konami Press Start showcase, the company announced that a goofier side of Metal Gear Solid will return, as the Secret Theater bonus feature will be included in the upcoming game. Not only will it feature all of the classic cutscenes from Snake Eater, but several new ones have been created for it as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="204">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=204" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're unfamiliar with it, Secret Theater was originally an unlockable extra in Snake Eater that reimagined the endings to several cutscenes.

The original videos will be found as collectibles inside the game, and for the new Secret Theater videos, players will have to track down enemy soldiers carrying rolls of film on their uniforms.</p><p>Konami also revealed a few more extras that'll be in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater when it launches on August 28, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/">like a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a>, an Ape Escape crossover on PC and PS5, and a Snake vs. Bomberman mode that'll be exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S version of the game.</p>

            <p>As we suspected, but couldn't say 100 percent for sure until now, Bomberman has been confirmed for the Xbox version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Konami released an Xbox-specific trailer for its upcoming remake of the 2004 game. And, while those on PS5 and Steam versions of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be able to partake in a spot of 'Snake vs Monkey', where they have to capture the Pipo Monkeys, we now know Xbox users will instead square off with Bomberman.</p>
<p>"Snake vs Bomberman for Xbox Series X/S," reads the trailer's blurb. "Take control of Snake and face off with Bomberman in this special side mode. Blast 'em away in each stage!" You can have a watch below.</p>

<p>As well as this Bomberman confirmation, earlier today Konami also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-taking-hide-and-go-seek-to-the-next-level-with-original-multiplayer-mode">"completely original" online multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, known as Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">initially revealed back in 2023</a>. It retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">remake has been done with future generations in mind</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura said in an interview last year. "It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">scheduled for release on 28th August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black...like a doll's eyes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/poppy_playtime_chapter_1">Poppy Playtime</a> is one of those strange video game phenomenon, in this writer's experience at least, that seems to be a pretty big hit with younger players, even though it's a proper creepy-ass horror game. There are toys of this franchise everywhere, and we've even got a movie on the way. And, it has the vibe of something that's fallen out of Roblox, too.</p>
<p>It'll come as some very good news to fans of Mob Entertainment's series, then, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poppy_playtime_chapter_4">Poppy Playtime Chapter 4</a> (the 4th chapter in the Poppy Playtime saga lest you're confused) drops onto consoles - including that there Nintendo Switch - on <strong>June 25th</strong>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Poppy Playtime, you see, is set in an abandoned toy factory that's full of very nasty toys who are set on making life unsettling for you, a factory worker who needs to get the heck out of there. Cue lots of creepy doll stuff that probably isn't really all that suitable for young kids, actually.</p>

<p>This 4th entry, entitled "Safe Haven" continues the nightmare, with a fairly large cast of characters to meet as you work through its puzzles and utilise its gadgets.</p>
<p>Chapters 1-3 of Poppy Playtime have been well received by players over time, and although this 4th chapter has already been released to somewhat disappointing (in comparison) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008670/Poppy_Playtime__Chapter_4/">reviews on PC</a>, there's still been enough love that we're sure fans will be very interested in picking it up.</p>
<p>Now, that June 25th release date gives us just enough time to get some clean underwear in, as we're actually fairly terrified of some of the dead-eyed, ghoulish toys in the game's fresh new console launch trailer...</p>

			<p>A remake of the first entry in the Silent Hill series is in development by Bloober Team, Konami confirmed today.</p>
<p>During the Press Start showcase, the Japanese company shared a brief trailer, which confirmed that a new entry in the series is in the works by the Polish development studio that masterfully remade the second entry in the series last year. As if the trailer's music didn't give it away, the Silent Hill official Japanese X profile confirmed that the game Bloober Team is working on is indeed the remake of the first entry in the series, which launched on the first PlayStation back in 1999.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="ja">『SILENT HILL』リメイク制作中</p>
<p>1999年にPlayStationにて発売した『SILENT HILL 』のリメイクをBloober Teamと制作しています。</p>

<p>— SILENT HILL (@silenthill_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/silenthill_jp/status/1933156514614988898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Bloober Team has handled the Silent Hill 2 remake, there's no doubt the Polish studio will do one of the best survival horror games ever released justice, hopefully bringing the classic to the modern day without doing away with what makes it so endearing still to this day. You can learn how Bloober managed to do so for the second entry in the series by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mixtape-preview-bygone-era-captured-beautifully</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mixtape-preview-%E2%80%93-a-bygone-era-captured-beautifully.1216731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mixtape-preview-bygone-era-captured-beautifully<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mixtape </em>is the perfect encapsulation of the wonderfully weird feelings of growing up, standing on the edge and looking at the fall to adulthood. Every frame is gorgeous, every emotion powerfully evocative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is no surprise, <em>Mixtape </em>is designed around music. You play one of three teenage friends who are determined to make their last night together one they’ll never forget. Each track of the tape is announced with a key frame showing the song and the artist before it starts playing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Growing Up is Weird and Wonderful</h2>

<p>Preparing for that last night together, each one of those tracks from the eponymous mixtape sends you off into a memory of some formative event in growing up. Each memory is lovely and powerfully relatable, ranging from a first kiss to running from the cops crashing a house party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In essence, <em>Mixtape </em>is a John Hughes film made in the modern age through the medium of video games. It’s about the awkwardness of growing up, the sadness of leaving things behind, and the rebellious attitude of youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, you remember your first kiss. In silhouette, your character leans in to get a kiss from a boy who she doesn’t much care for but wanted to get her first kiss out of the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cut to an insanely detailed set of teeth and tongues. Each thumbstick controls its own tongue as the writhe, slap, and slither together. It is awkward, hilarious, and a perfect way to show just how weird it all can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every memory is a little story told about their lives that is a great window into the era the game is portraying. Quick cuts to static images doodled on in the background, like MTV, and flourishes of art are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, <em>Mixtape </em>has a stellar aesthetic that is impeccably drawn together. It is extremely effective.</p>

<h2>Mixtape's Visual, Sound, and Gameplay Design Come Together Perfectly</h2>

<p>Even just the visual design of the neighborhoods and the roads the characters skate on works. There is an authentic realism to them that fits the somewhat cartoonish characters that inhabit it very well.</p>

<p>The opening scene sees you and your friends skating down a huge hill, each of you yelling out "Car!" when one is coming to avoid it, while leaves litter the ground and the greenery passes you by. It is a beautiful introduction into the world, and the lighting ties it all together into one of the better looking stretches of games in memory.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, seeing as all of the memories and the game is named after a mixtape, the tracks fit the moods of whatever is going on perfectly. <em>Mixtape </em>features a huge list of amazing artist, like&nbsp;The Smashing Pumpkins, the Cure, DEVO, Iggy Pop, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Obviously, the music is great in and of itself, but a lot of thought and care has been put into making sure each track enhances what we see and play on screen. Gaming's best moments are when gameplay, visuals, and sound all come together as one, and <em>Mixtape </em>is designed to hit you over the head with that again and again as we move from track to track down memory lane.</p>

<h2>Mixtape Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>My brief preview of <em>Mixtape </em>makes me confident in saying that it will be the best coming of age story put to video games that I can think of. It’s a classic story of teenagers moving through the world as they try to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to soak it all in and vibe with a soundtrack that will transport me to a past I may never have experienced, but it’s one that everyone will relate to. If I had to guess, I imagine there will be a fair few people that find many aspects of it eerily biographical.</p>

<hr><p>Mixtape was previewed at Summer Game Fest.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux-announced-for-pc-and-consoles.1216728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Beef, as well as publishers Flat2VR Studios and Running With Scissors, have announced&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>, a ground-up remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>that's hitting Kickstarter sometime later this summer.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>will serve as "part modernization, part love-letter". It'll utilize the Unity engine, rather than the original's "creaking Unreal 1.5 engine", and it'll boast a host of other improvements and tweaks besides.</p>

<p>Team Beef and Flat2VR say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver the ultimate, no-excuse&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>sandbox". The game's world will apparently be "rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/postal-2-redux-welcome-to-paradise.jpg?itok=loAxe-3o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/postal-2-redux-welcome-to-paradise.jpg?itok=7fz_DlFK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>modernizes the 2003 original, and it's coming to Kickstarter this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements offered by&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>include modernized visuals, with the game's textures and lighting both getting a Unity-powered glow-up (quite literally, in the latter case).</p>

<p>Additionally, you can expect a world with "zero" loading times, as well as smarter crowd AI with "improved pathfinding", new weapon and explosion physics, and "fully propped, breakable interiors". Not only that, but lovable dog Champ is also getting a "Champ 2.0" overhaul.</p>

<p>The three studios say that&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is aiming to land on "every modern box that'll boot", including the Switch 2, by the sounds of things. Notably, the list of platforms doesn't include the Xbox One, so hopefully, you've upgraded to a Series X|S if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game does come to all of those platforms, however, will be dependent on how the upcoming <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> performs. Despite that, however, Team Beef's Grant Bagwell says the campaign is just an opportunity to "shove even more nonsense in", so it seems the game will happen either way.</p>




<p>This remake follows in the footsteps of 2016's&nbsp;<em>Postal Redux</em>, albeit handled by a different development team to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/postal-redux-review-no-return-address" rel="nofollow">that game</a>. It'll also technically serve as the seventh full game in the&nbsp;<em>Postal&nbsp;</em>franchise (not counting mobile games and joke titles, of course).</p>

<p><em>Postal 2 Redux</em>'s Kickstarter campaign begins later this year, although we don't have a concrete date for it yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

You can give them a peep on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/">Steam page</a>, where they’re revealed as a refreshingly light list of relatively attainable cards 'n' chips, with a mere 25GB storage requirement – a welcome bucking of recent trends for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">100GB-plus</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-hope-youve-got-a-spare-190gb-kicking-about-for-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">SSD installations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">extravagant GPU demands</a>.</p>
<p>In less encouraging news, the same Steam page also includes one detail that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/summer-game-fest-2025">Summer Game Fest</a> trailer didn’t mention: Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes use of generative AI, specifically to create "Scientists' avatars" among your park staff.</p>

<p>That disclosure is, at least, more detailed and specific <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">than some games bother with</a>. And we don’t yet know how often or even in what context we’ll see these machine-hewn boffins – if they’re just dinky models wandering around the raptor paddocks, specks of white in your god’s-eye view, you might not even notice their soulless, artless visages. Still, it remains easy to forget about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-a-best-case-scenario-future-generative-ai-must-put-creators-at-its-heart">more optimistic arguments</a> for AI generation when the real-life examples we’ve seen so far tend towards the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-devs-multiplayer-shooter-the-finals-is-full-of-ai-voices-and-oof-you-can-tell">robotic</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-strongly-feel-this-ai-powered-demo-of-quake-2-is-an-insult-to-life-itself">terrible</a>. You could say Evolution 3’s approach will prevent asset recycling, but I personally wouldn’t worry about a repeating scientist face breaking the immersion of my cloned dinosaur theme park.</p>
<p>Anyway, system requirements. Again, these look very accessible by 2025 standards: even the recommended graphics card list is a mix of mid-range oldies and newer budget models, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-b580-review">Intel Arc B580</a>. And again, 25GB isn’t much to make room for these days either – that’s less than half the storage heft of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>.

<p>The game itself promises an upgraded, more modular suite of building and terraforming tools, as well as lil’ baby dinos you’ll be able to nuture into profitably terrifying adulthood. It also features the vocal talents of film series star Jeff Goldblum, which unfortunately makes me<em> less</em> interested, as – and this is not necessarily the fault of Mr. Goldblum himself – I cannot mental unshackle him from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thirty-flights-of-loving">Thirty Flights of Loving</a> mode that replaces every character with his mumbling, stuttering likeness:</p>

Well well well, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake developers Bloober Team are working on a remake of the very first Silent Hill in collaboration with publishers Konami. Please give me a few seconds to pat myself furiously on the back for asking Bloober about the prospects of an original Silent Hill remake, way back in August last year. Oracular insight, thy name is Edwin. OK, that's enough patting, my shoulders are starting to hurt. You can watch the teaser trailer now, which surfaced during Konami's Press Start showcase today. Lovely to hear that gut-twisting banjo melody again.

<p>
There's zip to say beyond what you see in that video - no Silent Hill remake release date, no hint about how the story or combat system might change. The game is only confirmed as being "in development". We can, of course, make deductions from Bloober's past efforts. In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>, Brendy called it "a handsome horror remake that plays safe with its own history". I had a few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">thinky thoughts</a> myself about the formal ironies of remaking a game defined by repressed trauma.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of playing things safe, it seems likely that Bloober weren't being entirely straight with me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">when I asked them why they didn't start by remaking the first game</a> last year. 
</p>
<p>
"I think Silent Hill 2 just matches our DNA way better," Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart told me at the time. "It's much more emotional, a much more personal story than, for example, the first game or the third game. And we at Bloober were always fans of telling personal stories about people's experiences, people's feelings and how they go through them. Not so much about, you know know, occultism and things from other worlds, right? So I think that was the main reason, basically." 
</p>
<p>
Lead producer Maciej Głomb qualified, however, that "it's not like we were making this decision, right? The franchise is connected to Konami's plans."
</p>
<p>
If all this strikes you as one throwback too many, you might be better served by the forthcoming Japan-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and indeed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the spin-off from Observation developers No Code, of which little has been heard for some time.

This is where you’ll learn just when to click to make your chosen batter hit that ball!</p><p><strong>One Nation Under Pablo</strong></p><p>For many fans, this is the game that debuted one of the most iconic video game characters of the 90s or any era—the legend himself, Pablo Sanchez. Build a roster from a cast of 30 hilarious child athletes who made Backyard Baseball a cult classic.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Random Pick-Up</strong> – A quick way to jump right in!

Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original Backyard titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t support gamepads, nor the Steam deck, in these original titles. We can’t use the original 32bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p><p>We can make the game run buttery smooth, stack it with Steam achievements to test your mettle and give you a chance to batter up to compete in the Steam Global Leaderboards for Home Runs. Baseball 1997 runs well, looks better than ever, and creates a new installation for digital preservation within the Backyard Sports catalog that allows the next generation of fans to fall in love with the title that started it all.</p><p><strong>Development</strong></p><p>With the original source code lost in the years since the 1997 release, Playground Productions has teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the original titles and bring them to modern devices. Forming a team of avid gamers and <em>Backyard Sports</em> enthusiasts, Mega Cat accomplished a near-impossible feat by hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds to be compatible with current generation PCs. It was a meticulous process that took a considerable amount of time and effort to revitalize the game. Given the intricacies involved in this remaster, <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> is only compatible with PC devices at this time, but both Mega Cat and Playground Productions are working diligently to ensure <em>Backyard Sports</em> becomes available on multiple platforms moving forward.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.</p><h2><span><a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Backyard Baseball '97 - Available Now on PS5!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I31HyDN4eB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span><a title="Platforms > Switch [17,221 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Backyard Baseball '97 - Available Now on Nintendo Switch!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNm-xIPa_Es?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Last year, the horror film titans at Blumhouse announced a video games label and brought its first game as a publisher, Fear The Spotlight, to Summer Game Fest. I eventually reviewed that one and found it to be a worthy entry-level horror game. It was creepy, but not overly scary, and made for a reasonable gateway into the genre for younger or less experienced players. At Summer Game Fest 2025, Blumhouse showed off two more games that, while perhaps not specifically for beginners, do well to express Blumhouse Games' publishing vision.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grave-seasons/" data-ref-id="5000-631819">Grave Seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crisol-theater-of-idols/" data-ref-id="5000-601756">Crisol: Theater of Idols</a> are each horror games, but couldn't be more different otherwise. The former is 2D, the latter is 3D. Grave Seasons is presented in third-person, while Crisol is played in first-person. Grave Seasons is also a dark twist on farming sims, whereas Crisol blends elements of recent Resident Evil games with BioShock, all set in a world inspired by Spanish art and folklore. Blumhouse brought these two games to Summer Game Fest 2025, giving me a preview of what's to come from a publisher that is technically still in its infancy, but also carries the name recognition and reputation of one of modern horror's biggest brands.</p><p dir="ltr">In the movie world, it feels like one out of every two horror films displays Blumhouse's logo in their opening moments. While I'm sure that's not literally true, it's certainly the case that the production company has its hands in all kinds of horror productions, from major series like The Conjuring and Paranormal Activity to legendary one-offs like Get Out and 2020's remake of The Invisible Man. The prospect of the company getting into horror video games is an exciting one for me, as I hope the publisher can use a keen eye to lift notable projects out of obscurity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gj9vincgw4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Gj9vincgw4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We have this internal saying: 'We're making all different flavors of horror games for everyone,' Blumhouse's Ara Josefsson told me after my demos with the publisher's SGF 2025 slate. "People think of horror, and maybe they have a very siloed perception of what that would be based on where they come from. Is it body horror? Is it jump scares? But there's actually a pretty big spectrum of what horror games are. I think our future games will impress upon that as well."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Grave Seasons and Crisol, Blumhouse has already announced several future games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleep-awake/" data-ref-id="5000-631820">Sleep Awake</a> is a first-person horror adventure from the interesting pairing of Spec Ops: The Line's director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails' guitarist Robin Finck about a dystopian world without sleep. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simulation/" data-ref-id="5000-631821">The Simulation</a> is a VR title about investigating a horror game not known to have existed before. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-c/" data-ref-id="5000-615695">Project C</a>, admittedly the one I'm personally most excited about, is the next Sam Barlow game, and this time he's enlisted Brandon Cronenberg for what is likely to be something gruesome, if the latter's filmography is a reliable clue about the mysterious game.</p><p dir="ltr">Grave Seasons' pitch is perhaps the most compelling of the whole list so far, though. The game's Stardew-like setup soon gives way to a violent murder--and a murder mystery follows. Blending the gameplay elements of something like a Stardew Valley with a story about a serial killer seems poised to toy with the genre's usual romance angles and gamified friendships. I'm eager to see how the game might spin the neighborhood cast of characters into a whodunnit.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oNGQ4KWPg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y5oNGQ4KWPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Crisol's art style was impressive, too, and I'm most looking forward to playing this one in the developers' native language, Spanish, once it releases. The gunplay was rough in my demo, as aiming down sights proved to be unreliable, but I'm hoping that gets improved before it releases later this year. Making up for that roughness was the game's clever wrinkle: You reload your gun with your own blood, so you'll have to balance your ammo against your own health. In my time with the game, I found myself having to combat my habit of reloading after every encounter, which added a challenging layer to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two things I've found to be true about horror fans: rarely do they like just one kind of horror, and often they're obsessive about the genre. Blumhouse isn't the only games label pulling diverse, smaller-sized horror projects into the limelight--DreadXP has been doing it for years and Critical Reflex is a new label showing signs of similar intentions--but like Annapurna does for weird (complimentary) art games, Blumhouse's name recognition does some heavy lifting for the horror games it signs. Even if, like Blumhouse's movies, they don't all prove to be winners, I'm looking forward to experimenting with whatever projects they reveal for the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p>How do you follow up a nigh on perfect video game? It’s a problem that Nintendo has faced more often than most, yet with each generation they release a game that brings new perspectives and twists while also refining the core ideas further. Mario Kart 8 in particular was the culmination of this iconic series first two decades. Sure, everyone might have their favourite that they grew up with or spent years playing in split-screen with siblings and friend, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/05/15/mario-kart-8-review/">Mario Kart 8</a> game refined and honed everything so, so brilliantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had to take a completely different approach for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, providing some brilliant and hugely fun new twists to the series. There’s the big open world that you can free roam around, and which provides the basis for all the races, there’s the 24-player races, and the Knockout Tour. It’s bigger, it’s bolder… and it’s also more inconsistent.</p>

<p>From the off, the kart racing feels immediate and familiar in all the right ways. You boost start the same way, you drift the same, slipstream the same, still hold up to two items — so many of the core elements are instantly recognisable — but there have also been a lot of nips, tucks and tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>In general the driving is now much more expressive, the tilt and suspension travel as you drift through corners more cartoony, but also subtly more informative for what your kart is doing. This goes hand-in-hand with the renewed character designs and animations.</p>


<p>You will see your character’s jump boost animations a lot in Mario Kart World, whether it’s flying off a regular ramp, bouncing across waves on the open sea with the newly transforming vehicles, grinding along rails or wall-riding, you’re constantly tapping the shoulder button for mini-boosts. The latter two additions are nice to have, but difficult to master and feel fairly inessential compared to simply nailing your drifts. Getting onto a rail can be more difficult than it’s worth, as you either have to hit the start of the rail where it meets the ground or charge up a jump to hop on. This uses the same shoulder button as drifting, and will just start drifting if you put any steering in. It flummoxes muscle memory and makes going for a grind rail feel too risky.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is a lot more forgiving when you get hit by items. You now keep some momentum when tumbling after getting hit by a shell, a Bullet Bill rampaging through will tilt people out of the way instead of spinning them out, and the lightning strike doesn’t keep you tiny for quite so long. That does make items that steal movement all the more punishing, most notably the Mega Mushroom squashing people flat.</p>

<p>A big reason for this general shift in the items is the boosted race size, which leaps from 12 to a whopping 24-players. Doubling the number of players means double the number of items being grabbed and fired off, leading to significantly more chaotic races. It’s still possible for the leading player to make a break for it while everyone behind descends into anarchy fighting over second, but wherever you are, it’s&nbsp;devastatingly easy to tumble from the leading positions to the back half of the field after getting hit by multiple items in quick succession. This can be brutal in the last few seconds of the race or just before a checkpoint.</p>
<p>That said, you can just as easily rampage up the leaderboard, with the game still favouring those toward the back with Bullet Bills, Mega Mushrooms and (perhaps most commonly) Golden Mushrooms.</p>

<p>While you feel all of these changes in the regular races and Grand Prix, it really comes together in Knockout Tour, the huge elimination mode that races all the way across the world map, knocking the last four racers out at each checkpoint until just four remain to race for victory. It’s a great mode, and my go-to for online play, but it is the embodiment of this even more chaotic style of Mario Kart racing. Knockout Tour is what all of this feels like it was designed for, and it has a knock on effect through the rest of the game as well.</p>
<p>Grand Prix is still a sequence of four races, but after zipping around the first track for three laps, all the subsequent races start with a drive through the open world to the next track, and then finish with generally one lap of that circuit. It dilutes the traditional Mario Kart experience, making Grand Prix into a training ground for Knockout Tour, replacing more bespoke race tracks with the arguably less exciting open world.</p>

<p>The open world is still great, in its own way. Nintendo and their partners have put in a lot of effort to fill it with different biomes, and stuffing it with nods and winks to everything Mario. When exploring in Free Roam, you’ll find collectables and P-Switch challenges to test both your exploration and driving skills, yet it cannot escape the curse that every open world has a boring areas you have to pass through to get to the next landmark. The jump to 24-players mean that roads must be wider and have huge banks of unmissable item boxes, and where bespoke circuits can do interesting loops and twists, there’s so many stretches in the open world sections that are just long straights or mild curves. No amount of Nintendo magic will make a highway not a highway.</p>
<p>One fix for this is would be to have a classic Grand Prix mode alongside the new. You can still do a pure 3-lap race of any track in Vs. mode, alongside point-to-point race combos that aren’t featured in the other modes, but the go-to for players will be Grand Prix, Knockout Tour.</p>

<p>The inherent messiness of this new direction is also found in the character list. The main cast are all here, looking better than ever, and have a bunch of costumes to unlock, but its like Nintendo took the franchise and shook it until everyone fell out. The field is littered with every creature and enemy that Mario has ever met, and they’re not given anywhere near the same amount of love. DK only has a single costume to find, and as beloved as Cow has become, she doesn’t even have a cute hat to find. And then there’s all the nonsensical inclusions of Sidestepper, Swoop the bat, Dolphin, Fish Bone and more. They’re funny, but they rarely make sense when sat on a bike and you can see that Fish Bone just sort of floats over the seat.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World is particularly good online. There’s Grand Prix, Knockout Tour and Battle, but you can also create a custom lobby for your friends to join and just share the world in Free Roam. It’s nice, and combines well with the Switch 2’s new GameChat feature, allowing you to play socially without jumping through hoops to talk to your friends. If you have a camera, then the game can also track your face and insert it as a marker for you in races, highlighting where your friends/enemies are for when you fancy whacking them with a shell.</p>
<p>But where partying up in Free Roam is easy, it’s annoying that you can’t jump directly into other modes with your lobby of friends. You can join your friends, but only when they’re already in a matchmaking lobby, and when lobbies fill up within seconds it adds a lot of faff where you then wait for the end of a race and then try to join up. Please make this easier in a patch, Nintendo.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s local split-screen, which works as well as you’d hope. Yes it will drop the frame rate to accommodate four players, but it’s still a lot of fun, and if you have a camera, that can add four player highlights to add to the shenanigans.</p>

			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar Games producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/">Leslie Benzies</a>, isn't exactly having the best launch. Even before the game launched, it wasn't having a good lead-up to release.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">Two chief executives at Build A Rocket Boy left the studio</a> a week before the game was due to release. The last major <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">trailer ahead of launch</a>, instead of getting people excited about the game, brought even more eyes to the game in a negative way, after early previews were less-than-enthusiastic. It also didn't help that the co-chief executive officer of the studio was claiming that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">anyone who had something negative to say about MindsEye was being paid to be negative</a>.</p>
<p>Then, less than a week before launch, physical copies of the game started to appear in the wild as retail stores broke street date. The studio warned players that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">the game on the disc would be missing a "<em>major</em>" day-one patch</a>, but that warning didn't do much to quell players' concerns that the day-one patch would fix all the issues those who had early copies were already seeing.</p>
<p>Now, the game is out, and on PC, we're already seeing that it's poorly optimized on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">only capable of hitting 60FPS at 4K, even with the beefiest of machines</a>, if NVIDIA's DLSS and Frame Generation technology are enabled. On consoles, things aren't much better, with the game being unable to hit 60FPS at all, and capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>And it's that last point that is causing PlayStation to give players refunds for their purchase of MindsEye. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mindseye-players-refunds-playstation-5-ps5-like-cyberpunk-2077/">TheGamer</a>, a player on PlayStation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1l8nl48/playstation_support_have_refunded_the_game_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">was given a refund for their purchase</a> when they pointed out to PlayStation Support that MindsEye was marketed as being playable on PS5 Pro at 60 FPS through a Pro-Enhanced mode. That's not the case, and a refund is being granted.</p>

<p>It's also not the only reason players are getting refunds, as <a href="https://x.com/WolfgangMishima/status/1932506058116759710">WolfgangMishima on X</a> was issued a refund for issues they had with the game, while PlayStation Support told them "<em>Usually, we are not allowed to process refunds for games that were downloaded because of the PlayStation Store cancellation policy. However, we understand that you are having issues with the game after the troubleshooting that you did and that you want to request a refund for it, so we'll do an exception and process your refund as a goodwill gesture on your account.</em>"</p>
<p>There's been no direct word yet from developer Build A Rocket Boy on the issues that players have been posting about beyond <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1932820162438218030">a statement that it is working on patches</a>, or the refunds, but it's clear that the studio is aware of the trouble the game is currently in. At least in one instance, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22">studio even canceled a sponsored stream it had organized,</a> almost as if it was trying to stop people from playing it publicly.</p>
<p>More accounts of refunds are appearing online, but for now, MindsEye hasn't yet gone full Cyberpunk 2077. PlayStation would have to issue a larger statement and delist it from the store for it to reach the depths that CD Projekt RED hit when Cyberpunk 2077 launched in 2020. But at least in that case, there was a good game to be played under all those bugs. If <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">early reviews and previews</a> are anything to go off, then MindsEye is looking like<a href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133"> 2025's Gollum.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towa-and-guardians-of-sacred-tree-preview-mystical-japanese-hadeslike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree </em>was revealed at Summer Game Fest, and I had a chance to get my hands on the game. It has beautiful art, and the gameplay is a close sibling to <em>Hades </em>with its own twists.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Towa </em>is set in a mystical realm inspired by Japanese mythology and folklore. That is where we get one of the heroes being a human/koi fish hybrid. Someone more versed in the mythology will likely see references in many of the heroes and enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Towa Shares a lot of DNA with Hades</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to bring up <em>Hades</em>, as so much of the framework of <em>Towa </em>is so heavily inspired by it. It’s a roguelite where you make runs to clear out rooms of enemies, make a selection based on a series of rewards you can get, then rinse and repeat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like selecting a powerup from a certain god you may want in <em>Hades</em>, Towa similarly has themed upgrade paths based around certain abilities or effects. You can try to build around that one set or go for a more varied approach.</p>



<p>You dash around the battlefield quickly, avoiding the many hazards enemies will throw your way by dodging and unleashing powerful abilities of your own. They are shown with the circles, arrows, and other indicators on where exactly to avoid.</p>

<p>Towa has a couple of big combat differences from something like <em>Hades</em>, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, no matter which guardian you choose to fight with (there are eight total), you’ll have a set of two swords to use in a run. You’ll be forced to constantly swap between the two as the more you use one, the more worn it gets and must be resharpened. Wear one down with some combos, swap, and repeat.</p>



<p>A lot of the upgrades are specific to one sword or another, so you can change the effects and abilities of any sword quite a bit. Moreover, it's something to make sure you keep an eye on, as it would be pretty easy to have one sword be the only effective one and the other needing some help as no upgrades have done anything to it.</p>

<p>You can also bring another guardian with you on a run. They are a little more passive and just follow you around, but have their own abilities that you can use on a cooldown to help out as well.</p>

<h2>Towa Follows the Guardians Over a Long Time</h2>

<p><em>Towa </em>takes place over a vast period of time, centered around Shinju Village. Over that course of time, as the guardians come back again and again to defend it, the village will evlove and the stories of those that live there will change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The village serves as your central hub where you’ll upgrade swords, abilities, and unlock new things over the course of time. It's where you'll learn more about the guardians, too.</p>

<p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em> is a competent roguelite that will certainly charm people into giving it a try with its great style. I’m also not going to complain about another excellent roguelite taking its cues from <em>Hades</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher Konami has announced that it's officially working with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team on a remake of the very first game in the franchise.</p>

<p>The two studios were revealed to be working together on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake during today's Konami Press Start livestream, where we also got some more info on upcoming games&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, both of which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">launching</a> in the next few months.</p>

<p>While it wasn't officially revealed that the project would be a remake during the livestream, that news was subsequently confirmed by the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1933156514614988898" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a>. The video was also accompanied by music from the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

<p>Creating a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>makes perfect sense; it's no longer possible to play the first game on modern hardware. It is technically still available via the PlayStation 3 or PS Vita stores, but you can't play it on PC or modern consoles (without resorting to illegal methods, of course).</p>

<p>The announcement of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake means that the horror franchise is officially back in full swing, having been on an extended hiatus prior to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>back in October last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=TI1l-VE5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=x7wHqu24 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is currently gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, Bloober Team is currently working on its own original horror game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, a sci-fi spookfest that's due to launch sometime later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Konami would pick Bloober Team to work on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill </em>remake, sales of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million back in January</a>, so that might give you some indication as to why Konami considers Bloober a safe pair of hands.</p>
